The videos are amazing! I would have to say better than amazing. The riffs, and solos that are taught are fun and work well with the level they correspond to, and I feel progresses well with a beginner and beyond at a consistant speed. The only problem is... that there is a grey area that overlaps the term beginner and intermediate so you may have to skip around the lessons to get on track with the course. For instance I decided to learn the riffs and practice the pull offs from the beginner DVDs and go straight into the intermediate levels of the course as the beginner sections where way to easy. But I would have to say if powerful riffs and electrifying solos is your passion then I know of no other course that will get you there quicker while having more fun doing it

Well i don't have much to say.  Anyone who does a lot of vocal performance sees these suckers everywhere.  Not only are they terribly common, they are common because they are good sturdy mics.  Good sound quality!  Happy with mine.  Shure has been making good mics forever.  It's definitely a safe buy for  any performer, especially vocalists

This microphone is an excellent choice for garage bands, home-recorders and musical enthusiasts--ultra reliable, extremely tough with sound reproduction of a quality which usually requires a much heftier price tag. This is a microphone that will keep you singing a good while.

The Shure SM58 is one of the most recognisable microphones in the world - and for good reason.  It is the main stay of many a hire companies microphone hire stock, including mine (pa2hire.co.uk).  Practically unbreakable, and if you do manage to drop it from a high stage / skyscraper, you can also buy a replacement pop shield.  Very suited to rock, or other musical styles that need powerful vocals.  Make sure your singers lips are touching the pop shield to get the best results, though, unless they have very good mic technique.  The proximity effect (increase in bass when you sing or talk close to the mic) makes this important.  If the singer is a foot away from an SM58, the chances are they will sound thin, and you will also have gain before feedback issues....
Sonically the response has a nice presence peak in the upper mid range, but the top end rolls off quickly after that.  Opinion is split about whether that is a good or a bad thing - it helps keep a lid on feedback, but it doesnt sound as hi-fi as some other mics.  I have had some singers complain that their vocal top end is not quite right - sometimes asking for more top end.  I guess they are used to the sound of expensive condenser mics on their recordings.  My solution is normally to give them another mic, like a Beta 58, or Beta 87a maybe, rather than use EQ.  If you A/B test an SM58 verses these mics it will always lose.  But it can still be a better mic in some cases, such as when you are looking for a cardioid rather than hyper-cardioid response (the SM58 has a cardioid response, which means it has a wider pickup pattern at the front).  But most vocalists will be more than happy with the sound the SM58 gives.
The SM58 also does a pretty good job on drums (not really bass drum), and other loud things like guitar cabs.  It uses the same capsule as the SM57, one of the best mics for guitar cabs.
In conclusion, yes there are a lot of mics that sound better, and some of these are quite a bit cheaper - but ask yourself the question are they as durable as an SM58, and if you are a professional, will your clients want to use a mic they have never heard of? 

Take care,
Justin Miller

I have been using the Shure SM58 microphone for over two decades of live performance.  It is simply the best affordable microphone available for lead or backing vocals.  It's so durable, you could literally use it as a hammer then perform a sweet ballad with no ill effect. I have never had one break down in hundreds of shows.

 My current primary SM58 has a couple dents from rough use in rough venues but sounds just like it did brand new.  The only reason I've ever replaced one is because they were stolen.  If you're just starting your professional career, this is the microphone you need.  If you're a seasoned veteran of the music biz, you've probably already got one in your gig bag.  

Get a Shure SM58, don't use some crappy thing that costs half as much, you won't get enough level into the board.  Your sound guy will thank you, they know just exactly what to expect. 

Any other comparable quality microphone will cost you at least twice as much

This is an excellent, general purpose microphone at a reasonable price.  I'm a classically trained vocalist, and I use the SM58 for rehearsal and "scratch" recordings.  It delivers clear, true, and warm sound under all standard conditions and requires essentially no fine tuning or signal processing.  I still prefer the crisp detail of a condenser microphone for formal demo recordings (my favorite is the Studio Projects C1), but it's hard to beat the simplicity and reliability of the SM58 for everyday use

When I got my SR60 I immediately put it on.  The headphones are comfortable and easily adjusted to my head.  I noticed that the foam had fairly large cells in it. My only previous experience with this type of foam has not been good, deeriorating very quickly but I am hoping that these will last longer.  The sound is quite clean and balanced.  As with most phones in this price range, there is a lack of base.  Had I been able to compare these side by side to the SR80, I may have paid the difference in price to get a bit more base.  Overall, I rate these as very good and are fairly priced

I am a professional musician. I loved my Grado SR60 so much that when I had a chance to buy a used Grado SR80 I did so. I can't tell a huge difference between the two. The SR60 is a tad more comfortable. I keep one set by my bed to listen to Beethoven quartets late at night. The separation between the instruments is lovely. The quality is wonderful - very smooth and lifelike. I can't imagine a better set of headphones. 
There is a clear difference between these and my earbuds - although I can lie on my side with my head on the pillow with the earbuds and with the Grado I have to stay on my back. But they are so comfortable I don't mind it.
The other set of Grado I keep by my rowing machine. I appreciate the long, heavy, indestructible cord. On that set I listen to loud rock and roll or traditional Irish music. It never gets harsh as I turn up the volume and it sounds great. I know there are more expensive cans out there but I doubt the improvement would justify the higher price.
If you are wondering whether to spring for the higher priced SR80 set, my advice would be to save the $30 and stick with the SR60. I don't feel that the SR80 is much of an improvement. Either earphone is wonderful

Last night, as I was going to sleep I listened to a variety of songs - Foo Fighters, Elton John, Queen, Johnny Cash and more.  It was an experience.  I heard more from Folsom Prison than ever before.  Captain Fantastic was amazing.  Not being an audiophile, it is hard to explain, but the music seemed new.

Great sound, low listening fatigue. This does not over-accentuate low frequncies, so if you're looking for overly booming bass, this is not it. Note that it's an "open" design, so that you will hear environmental noise pretty clearly - it will not keep outside noises out

I finally caved in and sprung for a pair of these headphones over the weekend. After a few days, I can say that I am truly impressed.

I have bought and returned many a pair of headphones after being dissatisfied. I will not be doing so with these. Accordingly, I'll try to write some comments that could help other people with their purchase. There are a few things to keep in mind when selecting headphones. It's also important to keep in mind that with any headphones, sound quality depends on the quality of the medium to which you are listening, as well as the ability of the device to drive the headphones.

My immediate impression of the SR60'swas that bass was a bit weak (matching a few other comments on here) AND that high-end treble was a bit subdued as well - but after a few days of trying different kinds of music and listening on different players, I have decided that neither is weak at all; sounds are simply much more accurately reproduced than with most of the headphones I'd previously experienced. Very significant: these headphones maintain almost identical tonal balance regardless of listening volume. I've never encountered that before, and was used to headphones that sound more "bright" or "warm" as volume increases. 

I believe that most budget headphones, if they aren't completely lacking in bass, tend to exaggerate certain frequencies beyond what you'd hear in a live performance. Here's my logic:

I tried listening to a few different tracks with the SR60s, all high-bitrate MP3s:

-- Pride & Prejudice Soundtrack (2005) - Dario Marianelli - "Liz On Top Of The World" - (Orchestral, dominated by piano and strings) - Any concerns about weak bass were blown out the door within 30 seconds. It honestly sounded like a *real piano* was sitting in my living room. And who knew that a string section could have so much ambiance? I used to appreciate this track for its music; the notes carry a lot of emotion. I now understand what people mean about appreciating a particular *performance* as well. 

-- Alison Krauss & Union Station - "The Lucky One" -  (Vocal, bluegrass) - You can clearly discern *specific* guitar picks, the streaking noises made by musicians' fingers as they slide up and down the strings... And Alison Krauss' crystal clear voice just shines. It sounds like a live performance. 

-- Max Graham feat. Jessica Jacobs - "I Know You re Gone" (Original Mix) - (Vocal Trance) - I've much ballyhooed this track as one of the all time best examples of vocal trance. It was also a good sound testing song, since it's based on a throbbing bass line and bouncy rhythms, but breaks down into a section where it's just Jessica's voice, piano, and strings. I must have listened to this song 200 times in the last year, and yet I picked up several new nuances on the first listen with these headphones. 

A few negatives about these headphones, now that I've played with them: 

-- Yes, they are bulky. You probably won't want to use them at the gym. I was able to tolerate them on the treadmill, but for actually lifting weights or otherwise doing things requiring changes in posture, I'll probably stick with my Koss KSC75's (an awesome bargain themselves at less than $20, though now that I've tried the Grados, the Koss bass seems a bit artificially inflated). 

-- These *really* leak sound. On a whim, I spun the headphones and put them on so that the outside was on my ears, with the foam pads facing outward. They actually sounded louder that way (if muffled) than with the drivers properly facing my ears. The open air design has it's advantages - I think it's partly how these headphones create the illusion of sitting among the musicians - but people around you may think you are blasting your music even if it isn't really that loud to you.

-- These headphones *will* expose flaws in the source media, and possibly your playback device as well. I can't stomach 128kbps MP3s anymore. When your headphones get this accurate, such music seems to have had the life flattened out of it. I tried listening to a few Beatles songs, and there were certain frequencies missing. It sounded like I was listening to a reel-to-reel tape. Oh wait, the songs were probably mastered on reel-to-reel.

My overall impression is extremely favorable. Sure, sound quality is a somewhat subjective matter, but if your goal is life-like sound, and you want to come closer to what the studio recording sounded like, these headphones are an awesome effort for the price.

     The best quality sound in mid and treble ranges. Bass some what weak.  Clear, detail  and non distorted tones emerge into the balanced inner stage of the headphone.  No other headphone under a hundred dollars comes close to the sound purity.
     Biggest flaw is the cord wires easily break creating shorts and loss of one or both sides.  I am on my 3rd pair due to wire breakage.  Repairs by profesionals have not been successful.  If you can afford it buy the extension cord to lower the risk of wire breakage

i bought the grados thinking i was going to experience heavenly sound, but that was not the case. I was pretty disappointed when i first heard them because to me, it wasnt much different sounding than my sennheiser hd202s and panasonic earphones. (note: i am not an audiophile and am just an "average joe" in terms of deciphering sound) But after a week or so, i am starting to appreciate them. They are much more comfortable than my hd202s (i wear glasses and the hd202s hurt my ears so much) and definitely sound better. But, if u ask me if they sound $69 dollars better than my hd202s, i would say NO! I am still trying to search for that "heavenly" sound or mind blowing experience from headphones so if anyone has any recommendations, please post them in your revie

Forget all the silly little earbuds. These are the best pod phones out there for daily urban use. They sit well enough on the ear, sound fantastic and you don't have to violate your ears with foreign objects and miss all of the subway announcements. So what if other people can sometimes sort of hear what you are listening to - this is only a problem if you BLAST your music in a cube farm and if that is going on, you have far bigger problems with your life

I bought the SR-60 after a lenghty review on the internet. My goal was to find the best available headphones for a low budget (around $80). I have been very satisfied with the SR-60. The sound is great, confort is incredible. Since sound is not contained they may be somewhat annoying for surrounding non-listeners. So if you are looking for first quality sound, low budget headphones and don't care to much about the looks, these are the ones to go with.

The reason I'm rating this a 4 is that I don't have experience with other chromatic
tuners, so I can't say it's top of the line. But.... I find it very easy to use and love it
being versatile in giving me 3 choices/modes for tuning my violin. The price is also
very buyer friendly. It has a good mic in it, my voice is A sharp, my laughter is an E
middle. ;o)

My wife bought 3 of the small children's zithers from Amazon, and none of them were in tune - so I picked up this wonderful and reasonably priced item to put them in tune and good order.
It is a very simple setup, with easy to follow directions.  Within about 10 minutes each, I had all 3 zithers in tune with 'zeveral' (ahem!) 5 year olds treating me to 'My Darling Clementine' in 3-way stereo.....

This Chromatic tuner, powered by one AAA battery, has a built-in mike for acoustic instruments and a plugin for electrics.  The LCD dial shows the specific tone, lights red if too high or too low, and green when you have it just right. I have used it on several 6-string (acoustic) guitars, a 12-string and a 5-string banjo.  The results are incredible- reliable and true.
For years, I tuned by ear. You know... 5th fret, etc.  What I didn't realize that an "E" is not just an "E" - there may be (are!) thousands of tones - all of which are "E's" - and this explains why though tuned OK by ear, one chord would sound fine while others would sound out of tune.
This tuner fixes that. In tune is in tune.
I have found it to be among the best (and least expensive) musical investments I have ever made - I wonder how I tolerated the way I sounded before I discovered it - let alone what others may have experienced!
A great piece of equipment at a great price.
I recomment it heartily

For someone who knows nothing about Guitars and how to tune them, this tuner is a "must have"!  Came w/batteries (AAA) and clear instructions. 1)Turn on 2)pick string 3)adjust until you get the correct note.  Once I looked up the correct notes, it was simple.  It will even tell me if I'm playing the correct cord.  I tried to tune by listening to a Beginner CD and trying to replicate the sound as they suggest, but on computer speakers, it just doesn't work.  This little tuner ROCKS!

I was slightly concerned about this product from the one poor review (even though there were more positive than negative reviews) the instruction manual is easy to read and helpful. Even if you're just starting out and don't wanna tune by ear, this is the way to go. Within 10 minutes of taking it out of the box I was able to use it correctly. I highly recommend this. Enjo

I am a beginning guitar student and I have no idea how to tune a guitar.  This little, easy to carry, easy to use device is invaluable.  It's auto function is amazing, just play the note and it will automatically recognize what you're trying to do.  For someone like me who doesn't want to spend valuable practice time reading manuals for their tuner this is the perfect device.  The built in mic works perfectly.  Can't beat the price

This drum set is awsome and affordable. It has a nice clean but deep sound, and works for any type of music. But since America now is scared of reading, It seems people are neglecting to notice that while the picture has cymbols, it has clearly printed it does not come with cymbals. 5 star though

I ordered this guitar for my 4 yr old grandson for Xmas after he became interested in my guitar.The company did a fantastic job and it was shipped and received in time for Xmas .The guitar was surprising detailed not like those plastic ones you see in stores with fishing line strings..these were real steel strings with an extra string just in case.The only draw back so far has been in keeping the one of the  strings taunt. There is an adjustment screw in the back of each tuning peg but if you constantly tighten it , it becomes loose..overall my grandson is completely amused with his "tar"and spends hours playing us  songs...thank

I bought this toy guitar for my 3 year old grandson and he fell in love with it.  It looks just like a "real" guitar.  In fact, he put it in his dad's guitar stand.  It can't be tuned like a grown-up's, but for a 3 year old and considering the inexpensive price tag, it's just fine.  If he continues to show an interest in music, I will buy him a better one.  I will definitely shop at Austin Bazaar again....they were better than advertised.

Music tunes into a part of the brain that might be connected to math skills. In any case, making music is fun, it's participatory and it teaches about rhythm, counting and doing things cooperatively. A collection of percussion instruments like blocks, and percussion accessories like triangles, sleigh bells are great to keep in a box for kids. Take them out and have the kids keep time along with a favorite cd or with a song they are singing. 

This is a very inexpensive toy and one that can teach a lot. It is also great for Christmas; bring the kids along to carol, and have the smallest kids keep time with the traingl or make up your own percussion accompaniment.

After a long spell out of society I was advised that the best way to get back in touch with my fellow man was through the medium of music.  My parole officer advised me that creative activities such as playing an instrument tend to show us how cultured and worthwhile the lives of humans are, rather than looking on one's fellow man as a fetid and putrid beast.  I have always enjoyed listening to music and whilst not being equipped to learn any complex instrument percussion is definitely where it's at for me!

I purchased this pulse triangle as a means of beginning the road to becoming the next Phil Collins or Ringo Star.  I found the Pulse Triangle to be easy to use and rewarding in the results.  I am able to add my own accompaniment to most tunes, from Fleetwood Mac's 'Albatross' to Nirvana's 'Smells Like Teenspirit'.  I did have some trouble mastering the later as higher tempo tunes tend to be difficult to keep up with.  My girlfriend likened me to an epileptic gymnast as she watched me playing along to the William Tell Overture.

In summary if you are looking for a way into music and want a simple instrument that tests the water then the Pulse Triangle is for you.  It's cheap, enjoyable and very forgiving.  However it is not recommended for playing naked

The package includes the XLR cable, microphone Stand, and the Nady microphone. The quality is excellent. The stand by itself costs $38.00 at the stores, the cable around $20.00, and the mic, around $30.00. If you need just one of these three items you get the other two for free.

If you're looking to start out in recording podcast, sound clips, or speech this works great. I bought the package for the stand which is living up to my expectations - great. The XLR cord works good with my condenser mic. I counted the mic as a bonus not expecting much, but for an inexpensive dynamic mic it does an adequate job. The package is definitely worth the 20.00 that I spent for it.

I don't know how Nady can supply a mic, cable and stand for $25.
The mic isn't anything to write home about - it's no Shure SM58, but it is better than could be expected and probably worth the $20 on its own.
And then you have an XLR Mic lead - try and find one for under $10 anywhere. And it's actually reasonable quality too.
AND you get a mic stand - you'll spend $15 on an equivalent stand. It is a prefectly adequate mic stand. Indestinguishable from the other mic stands I've purchased at $20+.
You can't go wrong with this package. The mic's not pro, but for a stand, cable and mic, it's amazing

I didn't know this brand before ( I'm not particularly audiophile) but I wanted  good isolating headphones, at a good price.
For the price ($50) the sound quality is excellent, they are small and fit in the provided pouch; a really nice touch is the small volume control embedded in the cable. 
Sound is scomparable to Sennheiser and Bose sets costing twice or three times as much.
The only downside is that the metal band make the headphones not very comfortable at the beginning, but you get used to it, it's not big deal.

Overall I highly recommend this, sounds excellent and matches the white iPod :-)

I shopped online for probably two months before finally settling on these headphones.  I wanted nice headphones to compliment my iPod, yet at an affordable price.  The AKG K 27i is the perfect solution.  After looking at other models by AKG, and other brands like Sennheiser and Bose, I thought I would have to spend at least $100 in order to get quality, but then I found these and I snatched them up.

The sound is excellent.  When I first plugged them in, I thought they were a little quiet.  But, then I discovered that there is a lanyard-style volume switch on the headphones themselves, which is fantastic.  I don't have to reach into my pocket to turn the volume up or down on my iPod.  The sound is very crisp and articulate, with deep, accentuating bass.  And because these headphones are designed for portable mp3 players, my iPod is powerful enough to really push the drivers of the headphones.

The soft ear pads offer great comfort for long listening (and sound dampening! They block out a lot of ambient noise!), but the headband takes some getting used to, as it is a little bit tight.  Once you adjust to it though, you can wear them for hours.

The last thing I will mention is the style.  These headphones look great and the colors compliment the white iPod really well.  They also fold up to an incredibly compact size, and they even come with a travel pouch.  Now that is convenient.

If you are looking for great headphones for your portable mp3 player, I truly say look no further.  I did so much research before settling on these, that I feel like I became an expert in the audio field.  The AKG K 27i offers amazing sound, great comfort, compact size, and best of all, affordability

The metronome was everything I expected.  I wanted a metronome that was very loud so that it could be heard while playing in an ensemble and also one that had a volume control.  The sound is loud enough to be heard while playing ensemble and has good volume control.  It is not digital so one can easily switch tempos. It is light enough to be easily carried around.  What I would have liked, but did not expect is a tempo range that goes beyond 40 - 208.  Unfortunately, that seeems to be found only in digital.

I am pleased to get this stuff very soon. However, I thought I got blue one (center of the circle) because they show a picture to customer like blue one. So, I expected to get blue one, but the seller sent me red one. It does not matter the color, but someone like me wants to get the same product you show me by online. Overall, I am satistifed with this product. Well, my metronome has a scratch already, so,, be careful!!

The sound quality is nice rather than harsh like some metronomes. 

It DOES have 2 sound levels built in; the adjustments are on the side. One is louder than the other which has a softer, sweeter quality. I can practice with my mute on or off and change the volume accordingly.

Using a Metronome: All of my violin students (children and adults) begin at number 60 on the dial. If the time signature says 4/4, each quarter note receives one beat and there are 4 beats per measure. They practice scales, exercises and all songs at 60 to begin with. Once they master everything at 60 they move the dial to a higher number. The following numbers are 63, 66, 69, 72, 76, 80, etc. (all the way to 208 on this metronome) Their goal is to play at 80 with no mistakes. Many students can play well at numbers higher than 80.

We've tried several brands of metronomes, and now our family has two Seiko SQ-50s in use. The best feature is that the clicks you hear are crisp and the quality of the sound is not irritating like other metronomes we tried. It's so easy to use, even the youngest child can do it. And the size is just right -- small enough to fit beside the music on a music stand or piano, but large enough that it's not easily lost

Just bought the metronome from Johnson instrument, it looks quite different from the picture. The new verson looks sleeker, which is nice. 
It is very compact and can be put in the student's violion case to carry around. It has a volumn control, which can be completely muted with only light flashed, which is an excellent feature. The Light is larger. However, the sound tone for this new version has been changed. Don't think I like that part too much, too electronic..  But overall, it is quite good.

Usually a metronome is used for musical purposes, but I actually purchased it for karate training.  I do a hundred kicks on each leg per type of kick and I use the beat from the metronome to keep me going at my desired pace.  Also, I can boost the pace and keep track of my improvement.  I know, a bit odd, but it really does the job for what I wanted it for.

This is the first metronome we have owned so can't really compare to others.  But this one is reliable and very easy for our daughter to use.  It is loud which is good for her to hear over her piano playing.  The headset option is great for when we, the parents simply cannot have the distraction.  Our daughter has a much more solid practice session as a result of this metronome.

The only drawback is that the dial only includes certain tempo markings....a very wide range, but not every number.  This does not pose a significant problem. Though when the piano teacher advises a practice tempo marking that this does not have we are forced to accommodate.

But otherwise, very good

This is mic is good for the price but i didnt realize that it had to have a phantom power adapter so i had to spend about 40 bucks on that and buy to more mic cords so that ended up costing me over one hundred dollars but this mic is great and looks very pro. You cant beat the price and the only problem i have with it is the you can hear everything around you when using it loud and clear. But outher than that it is the best mic i have had thus far

i have had this microphone for almost 3 years now, and it still works well.  the shock mounting has broken, but the actual microphone unit is still going strong.  

i am definitely not an expert in music but i do like sound. i find the highs are a little extreme and sometimes bordering on harsh in this microphone.  i realise that terms like 'muddy' are somewhat open to interpretation but i have no qualms with the clarity of the midtones in recording solo vocals or acoustic instruments.  as has been noted in previous reviews, this microphone requires phantom power. i'm running it through my alto s-6 mixing desk.

at this price it is definitely picking up one of these microphones, i'm very happy having chosen it as my first compressor mic, but now (after almost 3 years) i think i should upgrade

I have two of these because they're SO cheap and use them mainly at home if I have a musical idea.  One of the reviewers above mentioned it was a bit muddy which I totally agree with.  But it's incredibly cheap and fairly detailed for that amount of money.  I'm curious how it will hold up over years of use.  Anyway, this is probably the perfect "step-up" mic for podcasts if you are currently recording with your computer's built-in mic or a radio shack dynamic mic.  I would choose this over the m-audio mics- it feels slightly more durable

I purchased this mic to record mandolin and acoustic guitar in my PC based home studio and couldn't be happier.  

It accurately reproduces my Taylor acoustic guitar. When used in conjunction with an ART tube pre-amp, it actually enhances my low cost mandolin.

No regrets here

The DAVA technology is my favored type in all situations. The combination of a flexible center and a rigid playing surface is wonderful. In addition, the pick surface is textured to enable a better grip with wet or dry fingers. DAVA is the only brand of picks I use and each type suits my every need. I whole heartedly recommend them to anyone.

For some reason I tend to shred most regular picks very quickly.  This pick with the nickel plating lasts a long time.  Also gives a nice sound

I have been playing guitar for a little over 10 years and I really love these strings.  I have tried brands such as GHS, Ernie Ball, Dr, and more, but these seem to have one of the best feel.  They have a real clarity in tone and are a great match especially for someone starting out playing, it will help their fingers not bleed as much because of the feel.  The only brand that I think is a bit better is Dean Markley Blue Steels.  They last longer, are brighter, and I am liking the feel a bit better as well. None the less, for the price and over all value, these strings are awesome, and even in my house, you will find a dozen sets ready to string up

Wow, I love this mic stand!!! It really works well, especially since I play guitar and you can adjust the boom. It's great for kids, and grown-ups, too. I recommend it to any kid that is just starting to sing, or if you want to record onto cd's, you can play guitar and sing. Rock out!!!!!!!

These are great fun!  My daughter loves to shake them and sing.  Brightly colored and good quality. They are fun for the whole family and just the right size for small hands.  They are good for play other than just musical, as they can be sorted according to color (if you get more than one) and put into things and taken out again; they lend themselves to hours of fun

The pop filter is of decent quality. The stand is not as flexible as I might have hoped, so it makes it hard to use it with the desktop Blue Snowball microphone that I have, but that's remedied by attaching it to the desk itself

This pop filter does exactly what it purports to; the flexible neck *does* sacrifice a bit of flexibility in favor of stability, which can be a slight drawback if (like me) you use it on a tabletop mic stand. Still, quite recommended

This is a nice harmonica in a convenient hard case. It's a good size (like the old Marine Band), it plays easily, and has a good tone. Only problem is a couple of notes keep sticking and won't play. I wedged them open but they stuck again. Oh well, it's still nice

I started playing harmonica earlier this year on a couple of supercheap Hohner products, then picked up this one. It costs more, but it's worth it. It has loud, clear notes, is good for playing single notes, and the two-draw is uniquely warm and friendly. Superior to the Marine Band, the Golden Melody, and the Lee Oskar.

This is a relatively affordable harmonica; it has a good feel- the holes are well spaced. Overall it is easy to play; whenever I am playing out of key or whatnot on another harmonica I turn to this one and it sets me back on track. Sounds great too

Well, I started on a Kay $1.99 special and they play good too but once I saw how fun harmonica is- I stumbled onto a little better harmonica, an old, old Hohner American Ace and it played so easy, I had to get the top of the line Hohner and got this Special 20 in key of "C." It did take a little while to break in the special 20 before it played as easy and sweet as it's step brother- the American Ace. It has a more contained, refined sound than the other two I mentioned and bends well. I still find my American Ace bends easier but it's probably 10 years old and the reeds are weaker than my brand new Special 20. I am still curious about the Lee Oskars but for the history of Hohner, the average $7.00 cheaper than Lee Oskars, and the fact it is made in Germany, I opted for the Special 20. Awesome harmonica at an awesome price. They also have a short waranty unlike other brands.

I am a new harmonica player trying to substitute shopping and technical research for practice and talent.  I went out and bought nearly every diatonic harmonica under 40 bucks.  Most fell by the wayside.  I still use the Special 20 every day for a couple of reasons. The one I have is easy to play.  And only the plastic cone touches your lips, not the brass plate that sticks out on lots of Hohners.  (That's the only reason the Golden Melody comes in second for me.)  Overall, it just feels really nice in your hand, smoother even than the non-stick Pro models.  

Unless you are shopping addicted, as I am, this is the only harmonica you are going to need for a long time

I have been playing harmonica for more than two years now.  This was my first harmonica ever; the one I learned on.  The notes are clear, it lends its self to bending, and just sounds good.  Perfect for learning on.  Great for continuous play.  I recomend this harmonica to anyone who askes me about brands or keys; the Hohner Special 20 "C"

This was a decent harmonica for a decent harmonica player.. if you haven't played many harmonicas and you're generally a beginner then I recommend this harmonica to you but if you play pretty good, you deserve something better than this... it dosen't go too loud and dosen't have the clearest quality but for the price what can you expect? and even if it dosen't have the clearest quality, it still has decent quality, and it's great for it's price even if it is cheap... so, highly recommended for the beginner and that's why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars

I am extremely pleased with the quality of this purchase and the featured capability to replace the reed plate if that should ever be needed, rather than buying a complete new harmonica.  I consider myself a beginner and wanted something that would be durable and long lasting for the money I had to spend.  I had considered the Hohner Piedmont Blues 7 piece harmonica set but after reading some of the customer feedback I decided to go for the Lee Oskar diatonics which are of better quality.

I am a grandmother of nine!!! I heard a man playing harmonica in a furniture store while his wife shopped and it was wonderful! Instead of being annoyed, everyone within earshot was all smiles and a small crowd formed. I wanted to be able to do that also as I love music. I had tried piano and was all thumbs- but this Lee Oscar Major C Diatonic Harmonica is just the berries. It took me some time to figure out the breathing but there are lots of sources for good instruction. I would practice in the evening while my husband read. I kept saying "Honey, do you know what I'm playing?" He would say no. After about a week of this routine, my husband started to play "name that tune"! I have been so thrilled. This is a great harmonica with beautiful tones and the best price around. You won't regret this purchase if you love harmonica. I especially like the fact that the reeds can be replaced, if necessary, by unscrewing the case. This Lee Oskar harmonica is great- but the bottom line is practise. At some point I know I will feel comfortable enough to play in the hardware store while my husband shops

I have owned about 30 different harps, including 5 Lee Oskars.  The Lee Oskar is the best.  Sounds good too.  It bends easily when you want it to, and does not bend when you don't want it to.  If you don't know how to bend the notes, get a Lee Oskar and learn how.  Then you can bend notes on any of the others, but it is harder and does not sound as good.  If you pay attention to the videos, most  of the professionals use this brand.  If you are a beginner, buy this because it make you sound better

This tuner does the job. It's got a cheap looking case, but it works and that's the important part. The one guy below said it was too difficult to open the battery door...the battery door is a little tough to open, but seriously, how much do you need to open it. Also it takes AAA's which are cheaper than 9V's. Anyway, not a bad buy, but watch out for other things from Musician's friend. I also ordered a strap and a gigbag which both specifically stated they were for acoustic bass and they were way too small. The tuner's ok though

Wonderful little device.  Works very well, priced appropriately, comes with two AAA batteries.

The seller shipped this out at lightning speed.  Ordered on a Saturday night and the item arrived today (Monday).

The method to open it to insert the batteries could be made easier

I've seen Tuners come and go, mostly at a high cost. I bought this to tune both of my guitars and my violin, and so far it hasn't let me down. I thought I had a good ear for tuning but this little gadget quickly corrected me and now my guitar sounds better than ever... Highly recommended

this tuner makes it pretty easy to tune (it has a jack input and a microphone), but it doesn't have much of a range. the tolerance seems to be only about a step or a setp-anna-half, so if your strings are off by more than that, you'll have to tune by ear a little first

I use this tuner for my violin.  I use the automatic setting and have found it very easy to use.  The "needle" on the screen shows if you are below or above the note, and once I put fine tuners on my violin, tuning became a very quick process.
Like others, I found installing the battery was annoying.  It's easier if you focus on pushing one side tab at a time.  
The directions are not helpful for someone unfamiliar with tuners.  Pressing the Pitch button raises the Hz.  My teacher prefers Hz 441 vs 440, so I have been able to use that setting. 
 I highly recommend this tuner for beginning musicians.  It has been accurate and easy to use

As a relative beginner to playing the guitar, I can say these are great picks for the price.  You really can't beat the price and quality. I have had no problem using them for casual guitar use/practice.  

However when ordering this item on amazon you are not given the option for choosing the thickeness of the pick. When ordering this same item on other websites you are given the option to choose either, "heavy, medium, light" picks, but here on amazon when I ordered I received "medium" thickness picks.  For the casual guitarist I think this isn't an issue at all. For serious guitarists I think they would want to specify the thickness

Celluloid guitar picks burn like the dickens. It's totally cool: Just hold a lighter to 'em and they go up in a flash! Be careful NOT to hold them with your fingers, though, because fire is very hot and it will BURN you. Just remember "FIRE BAD!" and you won't go too far wrong. 

If you're looking for picks to play guitar with, celluloid is worthless. They're fragile, and the surface is far too slick if your hands sweat at all. Try Tortex or Delrins. Tortex is the business, in my experience. 

I should note that every one of the guitar picks mentioned in this review is fully compatible with all major operating systems except for CPM/80 and the old Incompatible Time-Sharing System from MIT, except for the Delrins, which create a sort of Tesla-coil effect when used with one's-complement integer systems. But you don't run into those very often these days so it's not a big issue. Besides, it looks cool.

Why pay 4-5 times as much for the same EXACT PICK?  Think about it... FENDER doesn't have a factory that MANUFACTORS PICKS? Neither does MUSICIAN'S FRIEND... so there is a FACTORY out there somewhere that is making  picks  for BOTH FENDER and MUSICIANS FRIEND...  SAME PICK ..  different  printed name ..
DUH..  I've been using these MF picks for a few years now.. I see them on sale for 99 cents    I buy 30 freakin dozen !!! Don't be a freakin Chooch... BUY a bunch of them !

You want a cheap Fender guitar you buy their lower notch brand Squire.You want their lower notch picks,well unfortunately they dont exist.Thats where these come into to play.They are cheap and somewhat durable.Celluloid picks have a tendencey to snap right across the middle though.

They wield great sound and if used right like any other guitar pick great potential.The looks are nice but i like the signature of a real Fender pick.After all these are the Fender pick shape and size.

I say buy these the price is a steal.I say avoid these if you plan to play metal.
(A very nice feeling pick

I own a couple of tambourines, but have played a few. This one is light, bright and kinda cool looking. The inward placement of the handle allows it to be played windshield wiper style, with the wrist, or a combination of both allowing for great speed and variety. You can also get two different soundings hits whether you use the inner or the outer ring. Hit the inner ring for a more open sound and the outer for a more dry and close one. All in all a nice tambourine specially for the price

This is a good product to have if you want a light weight, portable keyboard.  The only one complaint that I have is the glue holding the bottom and the top together has come lose several times.  I had to get a special adhesive that works well on rubber products to glue it together again.  The sounds are good and it is fun to play and you can play it anywhere there is a hard surface to place it on.

I Bought The Program Reason And The Tutorial DVD Simultaneously So I Really Did Not Have The Opportunity To Play With The Software Before Viewing The DVD. That Being Said I Could Not See Using The Program Effectively Without The DVD. This Was The The First True Piece Of Audio Software I Ever Purchased So To Have A Visual/Audio Aid To Guide Me Step By Step Through The Process Was A Lifesaver. From A Beginners Standpoint The DVD Uses Some Terms That Are Unfamiliar And Kind Of Hard To Grasp. But With Repeated Viewings I Am Able To Make Some Great Music. I Would Recommend This DVD To Anyone Who Has Purchased The Program Reason

Music tunes into a part of the brain that might be connected to math skills. In any case, making music is fun, it's participatory and it teaches about rhythm, counting and doing things cooperatively. A collection of percussion instruments like blocks, and percussion accessories like sleigh bells are great to keep in a box for kids. Take them out and have the kids keep time along with a favorite cd or with a song they are singing. This is a very inexpensive toy and one that can teach a lot. It is also great for Christmas; bring the kids along to carol, and have the smallest kids keep time with the sleigh bells or make up your own percussion accompaniement.

Musician's Friend ships orders very quickly and I got this bag together with my new dreadnought guitar within 3 days.  This bag is really well priced ($15) so it's a great deal.  It is built with very sturdy nylon which protects the guitar well.  The nylon is not very thick (about a third-inch), but it gets the job done.  It also has nice shoulder straps to allow carrying the guitar over your back.  The only weakness is that it does not have many/good pocket compartments.  It has a large pocket but the pocket cover is not tightly closed - it's closed with a strap, so things could fall out if you somehow get the bag upside down.  It also has a smaller pocket on top of the larger pocket - this pocket has a zipper and things will not fall out.  Overall a great bag for the price

Everyone has known for a good while that if you wanted *clean*  *distortion* get the Big Muff, no question. It is I'm happy to say the same and really better. I bought my second just a bit ago having heard of the sustain feature for the first time. Not to gild the lily but I'll be dipped. It makes it better.
I think the best and most effective thing I can say is:  "get a decent used amp no "EFX" if possible. Use the "simplest" amp with ONLY Big Muff and that will 95% sure find the sound you wan

For years I used Rat distortion boxes for guitar and for bass. Now I play bass a lot more in bands, and find the Rat sound to be weak and one dimensional. I sold off my rat and tried out a number of other distortion boxes at a local shop and settled on the Big Muff Pi. This thing is rich. The complexity of the distortion is incredible compared to what you get with most other pedals--must be the brilliant Russian engineering behind it. It has three knobs: Volume, Sustain, and Tone. The Volume is obvious, the sustain is really the distortion level. For the Bass, I run the sustain very low, and the volume higher and get a great mix of clean and distorted tone. Sometimes I run the sustain knob turned all the way off and this thing still drives the sound nicely. Too much distortion on the bass and you loose your ability to cut through the rest of the band in my opinion. The Tone knob adjusts the center frequency of the distortion. I run mine way over to the left and distort the low end around 200-400 kHz. You can crank it around and get anything from a low grumbly distortion tall the way to a really tinny irritating heavy metal sound. This thing is versatile, and no matter how you like your settings, the distortion it produces is rich in harmonic overtones, multi-dimensional, and unlike any other boxes I've tried. Highly recommended.
My only complaint is that this box is designed to work only on battery power--no AC adapter at all. Fortunately now there's an adapter from One-Spot that can be connected to a battery lead and then to an AC adapter. Hopefully Amazon will start carrying that soon.

We bought this pickholder for my 6 year old son who just got a guitar for Christmas. The pickholder has a little peice of paper on the back of it that you just peel off and then stick the holder on your guitar. It's great to not have to worry about him losing his picks. I think the holder fit about 10 picks in it. The picks fit into the holder perfectly and come out with ease. Great product, especially for kids

The Kyser capo is well designed. Normally "parked" on the head of my guitar, I can easily add, move or remove in 2 seconds. The unique feature of this capo is that you can flip it around, for example, cover the 3rd 4th and 5th strings on the second fret to convert it to an open E B A E B E tuning from a standard E B G D A E tuning. Very reliable and fun. Highly recommended

I checked out these little $15.00 pedals out at Guitar Center and was surprisingly impressed. They're very quiet and sound great. For someone who wants to explore effect processing, these are a great start. Same goes if you are just expanding your pedalboard like myself. The only cons are you can't see the setting of the knob from the top (but it does give you the experience of trusting your ears and not your eyes to create the right effects) and the footswitch is difficult to trigger if the box is sitting behind another pedal.

And to the review whining about not getting a battery with the pedal...WWWAAHHH WWAAHH WWAAHH!!!! Buy an adaptor!!

These are a great little pedals for the price!

This unit is simply stunning: a beautiful, harmonic, warm rounded overdrive sound.  Way better than any of the Boss boxes, check out the sound on the Dan Electro website.

I bought this based on sound not price, but that makes it all the sweeter

I have 3 Danelectro Fab effects pedals. The sound I get from this overdrive pedal is much more than I thought I'd get for my starter collection. A couple, more expensive effects I purchased, made by another brand, don't seem to be any better than the Danelectro Fab.

The casing is a heavy duty plastic, not metal so I'm not sure how well it would hold up to stage use or someone with a heavy foot. 

As for the comment about this pedal being a waste of time by another reviewer, most guitarists already know that they need to purchase an AC adaptor for a power source. Consider it a learning experience. Once you buy the adapter be sure to pick up a multi-plug cable if you want more than one effects pedal. This allows you to hook up several more plugs to the one AC adaptor. I now have 5 effects pedals hooked up to one energy source. Bought mine at The Guitar Center so I don't know if Amazon carries them.

Radio waves are everywhere and travel great distances depending on the tower they come from. I used to get a woman talking to truckers over her CB radio through my stereo. Talk to a friend who is an electrical engineer or someone at an electronics store about suggestions to cut down on or eliminate radio interference

Very impressive tone for such a cheap pedal. I love Danelectro pedals, I have 4 of them. They're cheap, but very reliable and sound as good as pedals that are 4 times the price. Doesn't quite achieve the tube stack sound, but overall it's a good overdrive.

I loved my Grado SR60 and when I had a chance to buy a used Grado SR80 I did so. I can't tell a huge difference between the two. I keep one by my bed to listen to Beethoven quartets late at night. The separation between the instruments is lovely. The quality is wonderful - very smooth and lifelike. I can't imagine a better set of headphones. There is a clear difference between these and my cheap earbuds - although I can lie on my side with my head on the pillow with the earbuds and with these I have to stay on my back.
The other set of Grado I keep by my rowing machine. On that set I listen to loud rock and roll or traditional Irish music. It never gets harsh as i turn up the volume and it sounds great. There are more expensive cans out there but I doubt the improvement would justify the higher price

I bought a pair of these, my wife tried them and liked them so much that she asked me to get a pair for her for Valentines Day (chocolates and flowers don't do it for her).  These headphones sound as good as my Bose for a fraction of the cost but give up a little in comfort (they do fit better with more use).  Do they really need that thick of a cord?

Whether it is listening to classical, rock, or hip hop these headphones deliver the clarity you do not experience unless to buy a $4000~$8000 set of speakers. At $100 you get the same level of quality. But a word of warning; these will change the way you listen to music as they will make your ears more discerning to the clarity of music. I absolutely love them.

After hearing all the great reviews about this product I was very dissappointed when I first plugged in these phones. The bass was very flat and the phones were not very clear.  The other reviewers mentioned a break in period so I decided to leave the phones running on my CD jutebox for about 30 hours. WOW!, what a difference in sound.  It was like night and day with the sound quality.   The sound is truely amazing.  The bass was very good and the phones were very clear.  Grado needs to state this breakin period on the box or manual because some people may decide to return the phones not realizing there is a breakin period

This was a great sounding pair of headphones, however, after a couple of uses the right side headphone just stop receiving any sound.  Not sure of problem, but as I stated the unit sounded great.  That's why the 4 stars.  Refund received without any problem.  Not happy I had to pay for the shipping, which, was why I did not ask for replacement

i have a huge head but these headphones are not a problem.  the metal band easily deforms to accomodate a dome such as mine.  the sound quality is ridiculously good.  they are very easily powered as well.  they sound loud and clear through my toshiba gigabeat which doesnt get quite as loud as an ipod (because of their efficiency they are actually louder than the 8 ohm impedence earbuds that came with the gigabeat).  

my head is a little sensitive so i am looking into some replacement ear cushions or some way to mod the ones i have.  these phones do leak a lot of sound though.  i wouldnt feel right using them on a plane or in a library or anything because they are very open.  you might want something semi-open or closed if youre doing travelling since they let in plenty of sound as well.  overall fantastic headphones, worth every dollar

The SR80 is the best headphone I've ever owned. Twenty-some years ago I bought a set of Koss headphones that cost me about half a month's salary (about 220 dollars) and these Grados make those sound like a set of free earplugs in a monaural transistor radio of the 1960's. Very smooth response, these cans are better than any of the source components I own. They are almost perfect for travel, though I'll probably end up purchasing a set of their cans for the iPod--the drivers are the same as the ones in this model, or so I've been told. These pull instruments out of a recording, and their ability to image instruments spatially is only matched by the clarity that they bring to vocals by Azam Ali of Niyaz or early recordings by Joan Baez. 

About the only improvement Grado could make would be improving the headband to can connection--it is held in place by a straight piece of wire, and the left can has come undone from the headband. More comfortable foam would be nice too, as long as it didn't compromise the sound quality.

These headphones are comfortable, simple, durable, and give some the the best playback I've heard. I have done a fair amount of studio work, and although you can get better headphones, they'll cost four or five times as much

I purchased these about 1 month ago and used the "burn in" method of leaving my Grado running music for 6 days straight to open up the components in the headphones for good sound and was VERY impressed. I do have to say that they are a bit uncomfortable at first but its worth it for the good sound and the fact that the pads adjust and soften up after a while. It's also no where near as painful as my ordeal with my first pair of canalphones which were the E2c's(see my other reviews).

Anyways...on the subject of sound I have to say that its an all around winner with its smooth but punchy bass and its open soundstage which I guess results from the open ear design they have, and although some don't like the retro look of these phones I've really been gettin into them as of late, another big plus are the rotating cups and the thick cable which guarantee's a long life for these cans. I also gotta give Grado credit on it's expandability with amps and different cups which will leave me hunting  for new components seeing as I'm merely just a budding audiophile with a long way to go and a limited budget that wont let me upgrade my setup whenever I want(cries)...

P.S.

If you use these with your computer and there are pops and hisses its because the Grado are too good for the card which resulted in me buying a new 24bit external sound card from creative that gave me a REAL boost in sound quality. So overall these are a good pair of cans for someone who loves their music but just can't afford to buy the latest and greatest in the world of sound

This is a real guitar. It will take a while to get it tuned properly due to new strings, so be patient. If you child has a guitar fixation, then this is just the fix. It will be too small for 6 year olds so be sure to get a 3/4 size for them. But this guitar is real and nicely made for such a low price.

Many thanks to the earlier reviewers who recommended the Amigo.  We bought both the guitar and case for our 5-year-old daughter to take to weekly lessons and we couldn't be happier.  The materials, workmanship and finish are remarkable for the price.  And more importantly, it plays like a real guitar.  The sound is sweet and round enough that I genuinely enjoy the sound of 5-year-old practicing (!), and after an initial breaking-in period it holds tuning well

If you want an inexpensive, 1/2 size guitar for your child, this is the one to get. The price is great and it has a sold soundboard, which is unheard of at this price. The tuners work very well, the neck and action are very good, and it sounds good. I highly recommend this

For the price, I expected a toy. I was surprised to open the box and find an honest to goodness classical guitar. The construction, fit and finish are impeccable. The sound is certainly not concert quality, but that is to be expected on a $50 dollar instrument. The tuning is reasonably accurate, and it is a pleasure to play. I have told me son about it and he is going to buy one for his son.

I've been playing guitar for about 10 years and recently wanted to get my Son a guitar for his birthday. The look of the guitar is nice and the sound is decent. For 50.00, the guitar is a solid value. the overall sound of the guitar is some where between ukulele and a full size guitar

We bought this guitar for our smaller seven year old son. It was hard to choose a guitar, because there are so many out there...toy version and real...but which to choose?  This one is worth the pos. feedback I am giving it. It seemed so small and cute when I opened it, but it is perfect for little hands and bodies!  I found the price very reasonable since we aren't sure if he will "keep the interest",(some toy ones cost close to this) but yet I wanted him to feel like he was getting a REAL guitar, in hopes that he will keep learning.  I found that the guitar is very nice, not a toy at all, tunes well, looks very attractive and sounds nice too.  I was impressed that it came with a warranty.  I am happy that I didn't spend close to this for the toy versions...and I got the real deal instead.  Shipping was INCREDIBLY fast from this company

I have an Almansa 435 Seniorita, which is a very lovely little classical guitar, so I have some idea what a decent classical guitar should sound like. I got this little one for my son, who is 5, and didnt want to spend much because you know how children can be when it comes to lessons and instruments. I was very surprised at the quality of the sound. It is still in it's breaking in period, so the strings are still stretching, but it sounds really, really, nice. I even played on it myself (you know, just to get it warmed up for my son!) and it truly is not bad. Doesnt sound "tinny" or "toyish". Sounds like a classical guitar. Now I bought a much more expensive one a few years ago for my daughter, who has since given up the guitar, and that was handmade in mexico, solid wood, 3/4 size, and didn't sound nearly as good as this little thing. For this price, you get a solid spruce top, the finish is nice, kind of matted, the tuners are pretty good, and so far the strings aren't too bad. The base strings look like they could be silver-plated. Unfortunately you dont get any product information in the box so who knows where the strings came from and what kind they are (the guitar is romanian), but the main thing is that the guitar sounds so nice that a child will be encouraged to continue, the teacher will be pleased, and the parents will not have to suffer from more than the usual beginning-any-instrument "noises", and perhaps a lot less because it has such a pleasant sound.  Now of course it isnt comparable to the almansa or to finer guitars, but for a young child who is serious about wanting to study classical guitar, this is a very fine instrument at an EXCELLENT price. This model is sold on other sites for about 20 dollars more, but why pay that?! If you are looking for a small guitar for your young child, this one is a very good bet. A real, very decent sounding, classical guitar for the price of a toy one

While it is obvious that the life expectancy for this item in the hands of a toddler may be short it is none-the-less an actual miniature REAL Guitar that can be tuned and played. If this item were Made in America it's cost would be prohibitive and it's quality would probably be in question as well.
This being no reflection on the American worker but rather The "American corporate Machine" which is only concerned with "profit."

We got this for our 21-month-old boy, who LOVES music and was always trying to play his dad's guitars. It is the perfect size and looks just like his daddy's black accoustic. He absolutely loves it. The manufacturers were smart and put the tuning keys on the bottom of the neck, as not to draw too much attention (which helps maintain the life of the strings). My only complaint is that the bridge is not secured so it is always coming lose and falling into the body of the guitar. I keep intedning to superglue it on...Otherwise I think this is a great toy for toddlers who are into music.

I use one of these cables to listen to the TV when the family has gone to bed (a low fi application for my SR325's I know).

The cable really is very transparent sonically (I've tested it with higher quality sources too!)

Recommended.

The headphones are great too

Since I bought the Grado Signature HP-2 headphone in 1992, the only complaint I had was that the cord was not long enough.  The same is true with today's Grado lineup and most competitors.  I could not find a quality extension cable for under $100 and even then it degraded the sound.

But this $39 15 foot exention cord from Grado really does the job big time.  I now also own a new pair of SR-60's and both headphones sound great.  I can sit anywhere in my living room and enjoy the sound.  Grado made a great product at an affordable and reasonable price.......but this describes all of Grado's products...doesn't i

I had to do a bit of research to figure out which would be best (not having much experience in this area) and was very happy I did!  This mic comes pretty highly rated on all pod casting sites for the price and (after using it with Dragon Naturally Speaking 9), I can see why.  I use it to do term papers and it is great!  It is an excellent mic with very solid construction.  Only negative thing (although very minor) I wish I had know that I could have gotten a standard mic stand for it instead of the "fancy" "spider" or "cage" design advertised with it (you really don't need that).  Lastly, no worries with the usb/windows set up.  Literally took it out of the package, plug in and go!  Again a great item

These stands have been used in schools, colleges, and professionally for at least 45 years.

They are nearly industructible, very reliable, and easy to use.

Avoid the clip on lights...they are also a decades old design.  They only throw light at the top of the music and are very poor in conditions such as found for musicals or opera.

This stand is very sturdy, and professional looking. There are no annoying bolts to mess with- you just push and it moves up and down, or side to side. It is also a very competitive price. I wish I had bought it, mine was more expensive, and nowhere near as good.

Grado has a world wide reputation for the best sound reproduction in their cans (audiophile speak for headphones) and they have the awards to back them up!  Too often though, I've read reviews where comfort is criticized and that these ear cushions are allegedly to blame.  Nonsense!

It is true that Grado cans are supraural (on the ear) as opposed to circumaural (around the ear) so you will feel the unit against your ears.  These cushions were redesigned back in 1998, offering greater thickness and distance from the transducer so that you feel more comfortable while listening through your cans AND the design allows for a greater soundstage for the magnificent Grado cans to impress you with.  These cushions, called "L-Cush" here, can be used on every single pair of current Grado cans except perhaps the $1000 set.  I use them on my SR60's, which come with a standard foam cushion that covers the whole transducer and it made them sound quite nearly as good as the SR80's!  I recommend them to you wholeheartedly!  If you google "The Listening Station," that is the place to purchase any Grado product from

These are easy to use and fit very well when placed.  I do wish it was easier to find a replacement for the pads of my old Grado HP-2's, but these work great for the SR-80.  I bought them just to use when the ones that came with them wore out.  I put them on to see how easy it was to replace them, and I had no problems

I'm dealing with getting old but I was surprised to find that I could no longer tune my guitar by ear. In fact, I was thinking the problem was with my old guitars.
I decided to get a tuner. I did some research here on amazon and decided on this one.
Reasonable price and the instrument store shipped in good time.
The first time I used it I wished I had bought it sooner.
Easy to use with either the lights or the needle. The guitars sounded great.
As others have said:
It's a little difficult to use the needle in a dark setting but the red/green lights are accurate.
A simple flip out stand would be a big help. Plugging in a cord jack makes it very awkward to position. That being said the idea of putting a groove on the back of the thing so you can insert a credit, business or playing card to lean it against is both odd and better than nothing.
Will have to see how long it holds up but I am very happy with it and I will use the instrument store again.

I'm not an experienced musician so as I once again attempted to learn guitar I once again became frustated with trying to tune it.  I finally found this chromatic tuner on Amazon and with such a low price decided to purchase it.  I'm real glad I did because it took no time to understand how to use it, and no time to get my guitar in tune.   

I'm very satisfied with the tool and would recommend it to any other novice guitarist like myself.

I tried to tune my daughter's violin for about an hour without luck.
The manual is not clear, I should say "not enough" instruction for first user like me.
Finally, on the next day, after asking a friend who already used the tool (but different brand), I could get it done.
Since the unit is good quality, very sensitive to catch the sound, I rate it 4 stars

I bought this tuner to use with my daughter's new violin.  It is doing a good job.  Sometimes it gives a strange note reading but trying the same string again usually gives an accurate reading.  It is an inexpensive model for people like me who don't have a good ear for a pitch pipe and don't want to spend a lot of money on a tuner.  I can't compare it to other tuners, because it is the only one I have tried.  My daughter's teacher tried it and he said it was fine.  I would recommend it for someone needing a functional, inexpensive tuner

I just purchased the Plusdeck2c PC Cassette Desk to convert my old cassettes to MP3 files for further transfer to CD's.  The unit works great abit trying to see the exact position of the tapes while in a fast forward or reverse mode leaves a lot to be desired.  It looses it's place and you have to do some guess work to find out where the tape is actualy at, but that is only a minor problem otherwise it works great.

When I ordered the Plusdeck2 I wasn't sure how well it was going to work.  Well I must say that it works great and was easier to install then I had expected.  I think that the hardest part of the installation was finding a desktop PC with a free 5 1/2 inch open bay.  I like most people now only use a laptop, but I did have an old HP desktop running Windows 98.  The Plusdeck2 was easy to install and I had no problems with it running under Windows 98.  I have had no problems with the conversion to MP3 and it even has a special feature for audio books.
This is a good product and works as advertised.

The overall package is well built and well documented.  The installation was straightforward and only took about 30 minutes to get up and running.  It does work, but, if you are like me, most of your tapes are getting pretty old and are not in the greatest of shape, sound-wise. Because the software lacks any capabilities to perform sound leveling and noise reduction, your resulting .mp3s that are all over the place, sound-wise.

As a cheap work-around, get the WindowsXP Plus! Digital Media Edition.  The Analog Recorder works well enough and is simple to use.  Plus it is only $15 to download.  You can use it with the plusdeck to play your tapes and provide input and then use the analog Recorder to actually record the files and convert to .mp3.  If you get a tape player with a line out, you can connect your tape player right to the back of your computer and accomplish the same without the Plusdeck2c

I have a Pusdeck 2c for a few months now and am loving it.

Pro's: Great for converting cassettes to MP3 format. Automatically detects gaps between tracks. Autoreverse. User-friendly software. 

Con's: PlusDeck's user-manual is quite unclear, and has many mistakes. Installation of hardware can be a little tricky for PC amatuers. They could have made the unit look a little more sleek. Soundcard provided with the unit can cause minor problems with PC's onboard soundcard.

Words fail to capture my enthusiasm for LMI's Transparent Tambourine, which is as fine as anything I've banged against my thigh.

Unfortunately, my friends tell me I'm spreading myself too thin between my tambourine and triangle studies, but I'm not letting their negativity get inside my head, especially when I'm putting in three hours a night on these babies

Boomwhackers are wonderful for teaching children or adults elementary music.  They are virtually indestructible and can be use in a variety of teaching situations.  And that are very resonable in price.  I do recommend also purchasing the Octavator caps.

This may not be the best tuner on the market- my Boss TU-12H is more sensitive and accurate- and it's not as rugged and convenient as my Boss stage tuner. But it may well be the best value of any tuner on the market. It's cheap enough to put one in the case of every instrument you own, and accurate enough to do a better job that you can with your ears alone. At that price, there's just no excuse for not being in tune

Korg makes good stuff all the way around, and this tuner is no exception. It's affordable and easy to use. I second those who suggest checking the batteries regularly; the tuner does become iffy if they wear down. However, this is not uncommon with battery-operated tuning devices. All in all, this is a great deal and it'll help you keep your instrument in ready-to-play condition

At least the best that I've tried. I am not a professional player or anything, I've been trying to learn to play the guitar for years it seems but never have, so here I am trying again. This is my third tuner, and as I said before is the best, is the most accurate of them all and very easy to use.
If you are looking for a very accurate and very much affordable guitar tuner you can not possibly go wrong with this one

I have never seen a better value for the $$$ for a guitar/bass player. I also play 4-string and 5-string banjo so I am going to order the GA30's older sister the CA30. It's the same thing with the chromatic(C) scale. I can tune all my toys with the CA-30

My dad and I wanted to play as a guitar duo, me playing on the twelve string acoustic and him on an ACOUSTIC BASS. His bass had built in electronics making it electric also. My guitar had a built in tuner but his didn't. Needing a tuner was must have. Buying this tuner was the best accessory I've bought yet. It's the best of all worlds. Good looking, easy to use, and also very small. I recommend this item to any who needs a tuner for their guitar

I'm a beginner at the guitar, so I don't have enough experience to rate this higher than 4... I imagine that there might be other units that are better quality.
In any case, I found the unit to be very easy to use, and tuning my acoustic is so easy now. Just a few seconds, and I'm all set and ready to go. Nice to finally hear what I'm supposed to hear! Nothing like trying to learn guitar, and being frustrated because it just doesn't sound right... now that I know I'm in tune, it has made the learning more enjoyable. I would recommend this unit for anyone who is learning to play

I've been playing the guitar about 45 years, acoustic, electric, and nylon string. I like Korg tuners and find them the best, particularly for the money, not only for my guitars but also for my fiddle and my banjos. They are small, sturdy, and no frills. They are accurate and inexpensive.  They work easily.

  This is the only real guitar tuner that I like. I have other guitar tuners that are pretty good that are not really guitar tuners but chromatic tuners with guitar settings. This is small accurate and sturdy and fits easily inside your shirt pocket or inside the small compartments in a guitar case. 

   It does have features for other settings which are great for alternate tunings.

    Don't be fooled by the Intellitouch and other strap ons. You can't figure out all their arrows as well as the dial on Korgs and others. They are too much trouble to use especially is you are doing precision work like setting up an adjustable bridge.

     The only thing is that they can be a bit unreliable if the a battery gets worn down. I usually check in new batteries every time I am going out to play some place serious.

 With the discount prices you can find in shops and around the web, the only way to beat the price on these tuners is to steal one!

I've been playing the violin for 20-plus years and the guitar for at least 10 years, so I guess you could say I'm a fairly accomplished musician.  As a musician, I have to say that this guitar is worth much more than its asking price.  It looks great and sounds even better, especially considering that it costs so little to buy!  I've owned several guitars and this one sounds just as good as any of the other popular brands.  It's easy to tune and hold its tune just right.  The proportions are nice, too, and fits nicely with my small hands.  I'd recommend this to anyone, especially anyone looking to learn and practice.  The black color looks great, too.  By the way, I ordered this guitar on June 5th and it arrived to me on June 8th -- talk about fast!

I saw this guitar on sale and ordered it on a whim, thinking that if it were no good I could use it for a canoe paddle or give to the kits to play with.  I have played bass recreationally for about 17 years, and occasionally strummed a guitar here and there.  I currently own a classical guitar I've had for 10 years, and sold my steel-string guitars several years ago.  I wanted this to replace the steel stringed ones, and to take camping, when I didn't want to take the fairly nice classical guitar and risk its damage.  When I opened the box, I was astounded to find a guitar with a very fine black finish, action almost perfect, and actually nearly in tune.  It looks great and sounds very good.  The sealed tuners are very smooth and have kept the guitar in tune thusfar.  The only flaws I could see were a small bit of glue where the fretboard met the top, just at the soundhole, and a very slight overlap of some of the binding glue onto the body, maybe 0.2mm x 1mm, only noticable when looking for it.  Soundwise, it sounds very good, especially considering the cost.   It sounds especially good with a pick.  The treble side of the guitar is bright and clear.  The bass side of it is a little thin, and the low 'E' is fairly dull when fingerpicking.  I am hoping that changing the stock strings might help it a little.  It's passable, just not great.  The frets are very good, and smooth.  The ends are nicely rounded.  I had expected to need to polish the frets, but at this point will leave them as-is.  To sum it up, I think this guitar is a complete steal for the price if you are a beginner looking to start, or if you want a spare guitar to keep at the lakehouse or to take camping.  It plays very good and looks even better.  Like I said, I had intended to take this one camping, but it's almost too nice for that

Just to clarify, this headphone amplifier does NOT have a speaker. You must attach headphones (supplied) or your own amp/speakers.

Also, it comes in either brown, green, or yellow AT RANDOM, and is meant to clip on your belt/pants. It's not built like a brick so don't step on it.

Also, in the negative column, I found the distortion sound unpleasant when I cranked it to 11. However, setting the level to halfway or 2/3 of the way up produced an acceptable distorted sound. (I don't have a lot of experience with other cheap amps, though, so the Danelectro might not be the worst thing out there.)

In the positive column, the clean sound was good, there was no hum, only a small amount of hiss, and the reverb was mild but pleasant. (There's no control over reverb level or speed, only an on/off button.) There's plenty of power to drive the supplied headphones at "loud enough to hurt your ears.)

Grand total: 3 buttons (Power, Distortion on/off, Reverb on/off); 2 dials (volume control, distortion level); 3 jacks (guitar in, headphone out, line out); one LED.

Bottom line: if you don't have a headphone practice amp already, getting one at the current low price is a no-brainer

THis is a WONDERFUL little headphone amp! Finally, I can practice/play any time I choose, and I don't have to worry about bothering anyone else. The unit has a distortion effect and an echo effect. I love the quality of the echo effect so much, that I have actually used it on stage a few times in place of my (much more expensive) Rocktron Short timer Digital Delay. As others have mentioned, I replaced the headset with a quality (but not expensive) Sony set. But, at this price, it's hard to believe they include a headphone set of any kind! Don't listen to those who criticize its potential for "live" or "one-stage" use. IT'S NOT MEANT FOR THAT! If you use this to practice or to entertain yourself, without interfering with other people in the room, you are going to be thrilled. I also lay down chord tracks, on an inexpensive cassette recorder, and practice playing lead. If anything happens to this little amp, I will quickly replace it. I have encouraged all of my electric guitar students to purchase one, and I'll be giving them as gifts to friends who play. At less than $20.00, the Danelectro e-studio 15, is a tremendous bargain. The features, flexibility, functional design, and quality of the product are just OUTSTANDING. You just can't go wrong

Surprisingly decent sound for something in this price range!  And loud enough to fill an ordinary room with sound; hard to believe it runs off of a 9-volt battery.  You can also plug in a Walkman headset.  In contrast, the Pocket Rock-It costs more and is headset-only; no loudspeaker.  The three knobs on top are volume, tone, and distortion.  It comes with a fresh battery and it has a belt clip so you can wear it.  It's a good value and takes up very little space.  I kinda like the nostalgic pastel colors, like a blast from the past

First let me just say I'm a big fan of Danelectro. I own six of their effects pedals in addition to this amp. They make excellent products for what they charge and I've been impressed with almost everything I've bought from them. 
On to the headphone amp - First off you might as well throw out the headphones it comes with, they're crap. But that's to be expected I guess. That aside, everything else performs very well. It's definitely loud enough, the distortion is good, however it is pretty fuzzy and gets noisy at higher volumes. The echo on this thing, (which is the main reason I decided to get this instead of a Rockman) is awesome. It sounds exactly like my classic slap echo pedal. It's very clear and stays consistent with the distortion on or off and at higher volumes.
I like the line out option but I haven't tried it yet. It's a cool idea though. It is smaller than I thought it was going to be which was a pleasant surprise. It's about the size of a pack of cigarettes, maybe a little bigger. Definately small enough to keep in your pocket. It's also very lightweight. 
My only real complaint is the retarded sea foam green color, and cheesy fake chrome but who cares, no one ever sees it anyway.

Overall I'd definately reccomend this amp to anyone looking for a mini headphone amp (...). The Dean headphone amp looks like it could be decent but it doesnt come with echo and it's hard to find.

Okay, it's funky in looks - but the closest I came to an equivalent was 2.5X times the price with a LOT less features.  Its hammy distortion and echo are actually fun and replace a couple of external pedals and the unit connects easily with simple instrument cables to your guitar or bass guitar or keyboards or whatever.  You practice in peace and quiet.  But WAIT!  It comes with a mini-jack AND a set of headphones.  I've got an iPod and loads of headphones - these are actually a GOOD set of (stereo) headphones well worth the price of the unit itself.  It comes with its own battery - no disappoint-ment for a giftee!  But the other cool trick is that you can hook it and its "effects" back through to an instrument amp with an extra cable -  How Fun Is That? - VERY

My husband is a long time guitar player, and honestly I wasn't sure if he would like this (because it was so cheap I thought it might not be any good) but he can't stop playing it or showing it off and he's purchasing another rogue. It's awesome for the money not one complain

Wow! I was totally surprised at how nice this instrument was when it arrived! I thought at such a low price it would be a low-quality trumpet, but its really absolutely perfect for my first-time trumpeter daughter. You won't be disappointed if you purchase this. PLUS Austin Bazaar sent a nice information letter along with their shipping notice on how to take care and assemble your instrument

First of all, this is a good game.  I have only played with two teams and I am going to have to say that the estimated time of game play for teams is off.  Whenever I played, it took at least three hours to finish, and less if we decided not to finish.  The hardest part is getting the industry awards.  The game always ended with both teams going for their last award, so that kept it close . . . which is cool, but it is the main reason the game takes so long.

Also, the board design seemed to make it so that we would land on "On the Map" and "Music Mix" more than any other space.  Most of the questions are pretty hard, especially "50's".  It was one of the funniest moments during the game when my opposing team was relieved to know they were to get a Britney Spears question.  The relief turned into frustration when the question asked for one of the producers of her album, and it was not the one that they knew.  It was awesome.

Overall it's a good game.  It just takes a while to finish (especially with the difficulty of the industry awards), I hate landing on the "50's" square, and it seems to get like some bands more than others (like the Band).  Buy it if you really know your music.  Casual listeners don't really help their teams that much

This game is so much fun. We've played it many times without repeating the questions.

Building your own band is really cool. The game covers many different artists, groups, fads, events and musical genres. I love the Rock and Roll Relations and Women Rocker categories. It's a blast to play with friends! 

This game also makes a great gift

This is probably the most thorough game based on music ever.  It's a trivia game with lots of fun elements too.  You get to form a band, break up other player's bands, earn hit record awards.  Rock and Roll Triviologies is here to stay.  Give Aleken Games a Grammy.  It's a chart topper

I just got through with fitting the strings and they sound a lot better than my last set of strings, no troubles whatsoever, they didn't break when I was fitting them either.  If you are new or even experienced with guitar and trying to figure out what kind of strings you should get, then these would probably be your best bet.  Great tones, smoothe strings that don't grind your fingertips, and really strong material for the weekend sessions.

I have used D'Addario strings exclusively for the last 20 years. I can tell you from comparison that they are much louder and fuller than GHS Boomers in the same guage and more reliable than whatever might come stock on a new guitar.
There may be other brands out there that might give you more of a lifespan but at the comprimise of tone. They do tend to get grungy after a weekend's gig, but if you change strings regularly I have yet to find a string that doesn't dissapoint compared to D'Addario...plus you can save the empty packs and send them in for cool stuff

I like the sound I get from the mic and it is very good valuue for the money for prosumer cam owners, but consumer-level camera owners should beware.

I bought this mic and found that it was way too sensitive/hot for consumer cameras like a Panasonic gs200 which has no audio input level control. It picks up too much background noise and overwhelms the camera's automatic gain controller when things get loud. I'm not sure if the gs200 had a mic attenuation setting or if turning it on would have been a sufficient answer. I put a cheap radio shack in-line volume controller in between the mic and the camera (which can introduce crackle if you adjust it while recording).

On prosumer cams with input level control like the Canon GL2 it works fine, even without turning on mic attenuation. If you have a camcorder with input level controls I might get this.

Another important caveat: You cannot run this mic through a the 1/8" connection of a Beachtek mixer box. You'll hear nothing on the beachtek's output because of an impedance mismatch. I don't know if putting an XLR adapter on the mic cable would work

i bought this mic online for $150 new. i researched for a while and decided this was the best option. i use a canon GL2 and this is a nice addition to my rig.

at first i didnt think the audio was all that great, however, when i turned on the microphone attenuate feature of my camera and switched to the manual audio controls, i found that this mic has a lot of potential. with the attenuate on, you can really get clear audio without outside noise messing up your tracks. i pointed the mic at an actor on screen, then pointed the mic away from the actor and you could definetly here a difference in audio detail.

note: the mic has two different posistions to mount the hot shoe mount, a standard tripod mount, and an addition threaded hole which rode claimes to be a microphone stand mount. my mic stand doesnt thread into this hole, and i consider my mic stand to be pretty standard. however their may be some adapters at my local music store. not a big issue to consider, as there are plenty of mounting options available

The introduction in the owner's manual states it perfectly.  Rode said that when looking for a good camcorder microphone, they were either horrible pieces of junk or super expensive professional models and so they decided to design a mic for this purpose.  This model strikes a perfect balance.  The quality of this mic is excellent.  It is very sensitive and has good directional properties so it rejects noise to the side quite well.  Although not meant for picking up sound from long distances it can do quite well from 20 feet away and maybe more.

The mount is attached to the mic so this is the only way you can use it and it is made to mount to the standard "shoe" that is on nearly all camcorders.  It is a mono microphone but it has a stereo miniphone jack that plugs in the camcorder mic jack and feeds the audio into both channels.  After trying several inferior microphones I was delighted to stumble upon this mic.  It is a good value and an excellent microphone for camcorders

Es una docena de uas asi como cualquiera, vienen como en talco para comodidad. Son duraderas y bueno el resto depende del guitarrista.

Si tocas baladas y pangoladas, no es conveniente tener uas tan gruesas para charrasqueo. En cambio la onda en que estoy de heavy lo hacen necesario por el desgaste en los riff.

I know a lot of guitarists aren't near as picky about picks as I am.  So why should you be?  After all, there is no pick that will make you play better and they are all generally the same.

WRONG.  I thought that too at first.  I figured it's just a piece of plastic, how hard can it be to pick one?  I started out with fender pick because they looked pretty conventional and they were moderately priced.  I blindly went through about ten of these due to them all breaking.

If you knew me well you'd know that I thrash my guitar...a lot...  Even the thickest picks would wear down on me within a week, and most of them were too slick to stay in my sweaty hand during these crash and burn guitar playing moments.  I came to realize that I needed a heavy duty pick with a good grip that would retain it's shape for at least a couple of weeks.  

At first I thought metal was the answer.  I mean, it's hard as rock and most of them come with a good grip on them.  But after playing with them I discovered the sound was not to my liking.  It sounded too buzzy with metal.  That's about the time I discovered tortex picks.  I was amazed.  They had the best grip I have ever felt and kept their shape for weeks!  I instantly bought every size I could get all the way from the thinnest read to the bulky blue one.

Months later I'm keeping a stock of these picks in my house.  For solos I prefer the green one because it's got just the right resistance for that fast picking but not too much so that it slows you down.  For strumming I use the orange.  It's just perfect...

I cannot express to you how much you need to try this pick.  Your wasting your money on anything other than Dunlop.  Get the tortex and see what I mean

Musician's Friend is a great outfit anyway, they've never steered me wrong. This product came fast as lightning, and as I read in the other review, the sticks were inconsistant, but I can't complain. We received a pack of 16 sticks, more than advertised. They are obviously not professional quality, but great for practice. My son goes through drumsticks like mad, and these are lasting just as long as much more expensive sticks, bought at our local Music store.

I really enjoy playing with this harp whenever I get a chance to because it produces a very good sound without having to blow or suck a lot of air in. I found it very easy to bend notes, in fact this is the first harp in which I was able to bend notes on. The roundedout edges are also very nice on the hands and it makes it easier to hold. It is made of plastic and not wood but that hasn't caused a problem so far. So I would reccomend a Hohner Golden Melody in any key to anyone. Although I would choose the one in the key of C, if you're a begginer because it would be easier to learn on I think

Back when I was learning to play harmonica I tried many different styles and brands before discovering these Golden Melody harps.  I really like the sound they produce and the ease of "bending" notes, even for beginners.  I also really like the fact that all of the edges are rounded, making it much more comfortable on both your mouth and your hands.  I know many of the greats swear by the "Marine Band" harmonica, and to tell the truth I wish the Golden Melody had wood instead of plastic edges, but I choose this one as my favorire based on the results I get with it.  

Now as for the key of C...  I get a lot more use out of the keys of A and E, but thats another story..

Well, for me it's a curious thing.

The Jellifish changes a lot the texture of the pluck when you strum or do arpeggios but it's a little fragile.

I like it so that I play with it a lot of time since I bought it but I have a strong strumming stile so the tires, the largest ones, are breaking from the root. This is not a flaw of the Jellifish, they are very clear about that to produce the sounds they say it's better to do it by light strum and picking. It's just that I get emotional when I play, jajaja.

I also founded a way to use it as a physical cello bow. Note this pick is for textures cause it not produces an effect like a pedal.

It's a smart product that could bring some new life in your playing, but only if you're open minded and don't expect a pick and neither a pedal effect kind of sound. 

I only want I always have a new one available, they have a 6 month lifetime I read somewhere in the jellifish page.

Hello! I just got this new device for Christmas. I had never seen one before, but I guess they've been around for a while. Well, let me just say that this is the best gift I got this year even though it only came in my stocking. I have had more fun with the Jellifish than with anything else I got this year -- I'm just fascinated that this little guy can change your tone so big! Anywho, I would say that it's definitely not for beginners. You need to be a real player to understand how to use it. Why didn't somebody come out with something like this a long time ago is what I'm wondering! Is there a user group for sharing tips and licks

The Jellifish is the first radically new thing I've seen for guitar since the Ebow. I love innovative musical tools, and the Jellifish delivers. I am a guitar instructor and teach over 50 students a week from beginner to very advanced. I have had all of my students purchase the Jellifish because in order to get the Chorus! Pluck! and Bow! sounds you must master 3 picking styles that every guitarist should know how to use regardless. Specifically, a fluid, sweep picking technique will produce a lush chorusing effect that is a cross somewhere between a 12-string and a chorus pedal. Alternate picking, when done properly from the wrist, will produce the Pluck! effect, which somewhat sounds like a hammered dulcimer. And circular picking -- done from the thumb and forefinger -- will obtain a bowed effect that is very nice on slower, scalar patterns, but can also be used on arpeggios. 100 years from now, the Jellifish won't be novel, because every guitarist will use this the same as they do capos and slides. Minimal proficiency with this device is de rigueur for any serious student of the instrument

at a local guitar store i bought a planet rock guitar like this. it is a really great guitar and can play any kind of music. but the cables and guitar straps that came with it sucked. so i bought some more and they worked perfectly. about 5 monthes after i bought it the thing that attached to the guitar strap kept coming off. so i super-glued it and it works fine. for this guitar i recomend a levys leathers guitar strap. i have a rat fink "surf all day" guitar strap. if you are a beginner i recomend a beginner pack just like this. for this guitar green cable look good with it. if you want cooler picks than the ones on amazon.com i recomend going to hotpicksusa.com. take it fom me an innocent child buy it if you think it is the right thing to buy. but i like b.c. rick guitars way better than that one. but you can at least buy a guitar here to make mr. amazon happy. so do it

I have found the many of the same things to be true as the previous reviewer.  If you want a brighter Elixir, they also make NanoWeb versions with a lighter coating.  They do wear out quicker though.

Before I started using Elixirs, my favorite strings were D' Addario 80/20 Phosphor Bronze.  I could get 3 sets for the price of 1 set of Elixirs.  I really found the Elixir's price to be a bit of a shock, but used them for a few months.  On a whim, I went back to the other strings.  I never noticed how quickly they oxidized and went dead before!  I've gone back and stayed with Elixir.

I've also tried the D' Addario EXP and Dean Markley Alchemy coated strings.  They were okay, but I found the Elixirs looked and sounded better longer.

Downsides? The uncoated strings show wear spots and oxidize long before the coated ones.  Also, as the coating wears off, I've found the strings get "fuzzy."  Overall, I still end up changing stings a lot less than I used to.  One star deducted for the high price.

There's NO SUCH THING as a "best string".  From experimenting over the years, I've found that, while I have "old standbys" that will be the first thing I try, often there is a string that is just right for a particular guitar and it varies from guitar to guitar.

Coated strings have become all the rage over the last few years.  They're expensive, but they last a lot longer, especially if you have the kind of body chemistry that causes them to corrode quickly.  Also, they minimize the amount of finger noise you get if you slide on the strings.

Elixir Polywebs were the first coated string.  The coating is much heavier than that of other strings.  This produces a much less bright, more muted sound.  I have an old koa guitar that is so bright I can't stand it with standard strings.  The Elixir Polywebs tone it down to the point where it's perfect.

If you're looking for a darker sound, then Elixir Polywebs are definitely worth a shot.  If you want a coated string but prefer the brighter sound of uncoated strings, then you definitely don't want Polywebs.

The 4 stars applies if you want this particular type of sound.  If you don't want this sound, you could end up awarding them 1 star

I know most people would look at this and think for the price it can't be that great.  But it does everything a capo should do and well.  I've had no trouble with it coming apart,  and if it does, I guarantee I will replace it with the exact same one.  You absolutely cannot go wrong for the price.

I bought this for my 3yr old son, he loves to sing and make music.  The size of the guitar is perfect for him.  The only thing is that it is hard to tune them because the tuning knobs don't tighten very good.  He stills has fun playing with it, he doesn't care if its tuned or not.  The price was great!!!!!!!!

I got this for my 9 year old pounding the desk daughter.  She really likes it and I like it too.  Sounds are adequate and it offers some pre-recorded beats (hundreds) that are fun to plug in and play along with my guitar.
I'm not sure she could become a great drummer with this alone but, it comes with a DVD and gives you a nice adequate beat pad for playing along with the radio or tv and for the price..was a great choice.

Where's the electrical chord guys??????  Seems to be the one negative but batteries AA will suffice for now.

I recieved this as a Christmas gift from my wife. I am very
pleased with the overall performance . I am a muscian who 
plays a variety of instruments including drums and have been
for30 years. I write and record original music and find this
to be an excellent aid to keep me in time while recording
stringed instrument tracks.The effects and rythymn tracks
included are also a plus. This is a good beginner item for
that young drummer to learn the basics on, without having
to shell out mega bucks for a big set of drums that the
child may loose interest in. They are also all but silent
when used with headphones, so everyone in the house will
not have to hear them. One cautionary note-mine DID NOT
include the ac adapter as advertised; amazon.com is
attempting to remedy this. You can pick up a 12 volt ada-
pter at any Radio Shack for about twelve bucks

In the description that ToysRUs has on the Amazon page it states that the AC Adapter is included in the box.  There is no adapter and I don't look forward to using AA batteries.  We selected this item because it said that it WOULD have batteries.

This was a gift for my son who is learning trumpet in his middle school band.  Purchasing it was cheaper than renting one for the year.  We are by no means musical experts, but he can play it as well as the expensive instrument we were renting (valued at $900), and it sounds the same to me.  The mouthpiece is a bit smaller than his former trumpet and that took a bit of adjustment, but now he has no problem with it.  The case isn't real high quality but with proper care should be fine in the long run

Siempre compro ERNIE BALL porque son las mas duraderas y las de mayor calidad que he usado.

He probado otro par de marcas pero nada en comparacion con ERNIE BALL!!!

El desgaste de las cuerdas es practicamente nulo; yo practico 15 horas como minimo a la semana, tengo una Jackson K3PRO (Floy R.) y aguantan bastantes libras.

Puedes prolongar el uso de las mismas si empleas mantenimiento con limpiadores de cuerdas, ya que lo unico que he visto que con el tiempo (mas de 6 meses)se oxidan un poco

Your brand of guitar strings doesn't really matter, as they are only a few locations, which manufacture all of the brands.  But the price of the strings on Amazon beats any music store

Take this to heart. I have been playing for 16 years this Christmas. For the first seven years I experimented with different brands and gauges. These were the strings I settled on after all that experimentation and I have never looked back. Slinky 9's are ALL I have bought for the past nine years. There are two types of electric guitar strings: Expensive and cheap. NEVER buy cheap strings. They sound too bright and about one out of twenty will break when you wind them up. Expensive strings are a little more complicated. The durability factor is much better with expensive strings. About one out of eighty will break. The difference between the expensive brands is in the sound. Some are "tinny" or bright. Some sound like bass strings tuned way up. With that said, Ernie Ball Super Slinky 9's have what I call a "V" voicing. It's like they have a little equalizer built in set to a good rock setting. You know, boost the mids and highs and roll back the mids. THESE... are the only strings designed specifically for rock/metal/southern rock/progressive heavier jam bands/etc. Period.

Man... I sound like a commercial. It's because I am passionate about these strings

These are the standard strings I've been using since about 2000. And after going through only 4 pairs since then, I doubt I'll be changing brands. Especially at this price. Just look at that. In just about any store they're up to 3 times as expensive. Don't let the price fool you. Sure, there are some strings around 20 bucks, but that doesn't mean they're better. Ernie Ball is one of (if not, the) top brands when it comes to musical instruments and accessories. The sound quality and tone with these suckers is phenominal. You can bend, whammy, slap and pluck these things as hard as you can, and they won't break. In fact, I've been on the same set of strings since about October 2003 and they're still working like the day I put them in.

There isn't a whole lot to say about strings. I mean, they're what you need to play the guitar and that's about it. These work well, therefore, they're good. Nab a few extra sets of these while they're so cheap

I am a Middle Eastern dance teacher and bought these for my beginner students in class.  They are small and manageable and have a nice sound for the money...if you are looking for some inexpensive zills for beginner students and performers I recommend these.  I also ordered some for another teacher and the students loved them

I agree with the previous reviewer.  I'm giving this item five stars because it is exactly what we hoped it would be:  a reasonably-priced way to get students started on zills.  There is no convenient local source for zills so we have to stock up and then sell to students, and the price/value of these zills makes that possible.

I bought these inexpensive zills for my students to use in class, as I was running low on loaners. Of course, I wasn't expecting top quality instruments, but they are just great for students to use in class while they're learning -- and still leave the student some motivation to buy a personal set of high-quality zills! They came in individual zip-lock bags, and even included tiny safety pins. 

Perfect for teachers buying for a whole classroom

I have tried EVERY type/brand of harmonica holder for the last 8 or 10 years and FINALLY found one that works great and doesn't look like some type of orthopedic device.
I will caution anyone using this harp holder to be careful when adjusting it not to bend the flat stamped spots that keep the springs in place. I managed to break one that way but was still able to finish the show in spite it being broken because it's made so well.

As a guitar and harmonica player who plays out in small clubs it is very hard to find a quality harmonica holder that perfectly holds 10 hole harmonicas .When your specialty is Bob Dylan Neal Young and Donavan covers you have to have a dependable holder that does not slip.This product is perfect for that type of music.I bought two so that I could have one set up in G and the other set up in D to cut down on set up time

This is a classic Boss pedal, it's been around for awhile.  Boss is known for their great sounding effects and rugged construction of their products, this one is no different.  The distortion from this pedal is simple, very smooth, and very versatile.  It's not too noisy, allowing single notes played to be heard with clarity.  If you'd like to hear it, you can probably find some sound clips of it being used on Boss's website

I hear it sucks with synth machines but with guitars it works fairly,now mine hasnt arrived so i guess ill start by saying it looks great and since its boss you know its built like a tank.and from what i hear its reliable enough to use in minor stage shows (talent contest,open mic night etc.).Its also the pedal steve vai and joe satriani use so i guess its gotta be good

Our son wanted a drum set for his 15th birthday.  Seeings he is totally new to this we didn't want to pay a huge sum for a set only to have him lose interest.  This set is great for beginners and he's very happy with it.

To people considering purchasing this, please note that the cymbals ARE NOT included with this set even though they are in the picture.  Perhaps the company should consider posting another photos sans the cymbals

The DAVA technology is my favored type in all situations. The combination of a flexible center and a rigid playing surface is wonderful. In addition, the pick surface is textured to enable a better grip with wet or dry fingers. DAVA is the only brand of picks I use and each type suits my every need. I whole heartedly recommend them to anyone.

I love these picks because they have an easy grip providing less slippage when I'm really rocking out.  I like that they are flexible and still very firm.  This is the only place I can find these picks latel

It seems like a gimmick but they really work. I was using the little jazz IIIs but couldn't strum with them - these work as a mix of a soft strumming pick and a precise hard lead pick
