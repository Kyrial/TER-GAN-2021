 This is a great back pack! If there is anything I would change it would be the logo on the front. It's brite and shinny, and I'd rather not advertise that I have a camera in there! I colored it in with a felt pen and it works great....... Overall, I love the backpack!!

This was the best item I ever bought for my camera. I do a lot of walking with my camera, and thought I would use it as a walking stick, which I do, but the best part of this monopod is what I never thought would happen. My pictures are NEVER fuzzy! I can take low light photos and have they come out clear. I paid very little for this item and would never be caught without it and my camera. The three levers on the bottom allow for quick expansion at all different lengths. The carrying case allows for this item to be packed next to my camera without it getting scratched

I've had this lens for 2 months now, and love it. It was my first "L" lens and I can see the quality difference in this line. First, I tried the 28-135 IS-pretty good. But I wasn't totally happy, so returned it and ordered the 24-105 L. Now I'm happy. Contrast, sharpness, & CA are much better. Build quality & feel are superior as well. Plus the IS really works. I will try & get all IS lens in the future, I believe it is worth the extra cost. Focusing is very quick and zoom action is smooth & steady. If you're on a budget, the 28-135 is real nice. But to go all the way, I recommend this lens. The IS on the 24-105 L is quieter I found. The price is a bit steep, but optical quality is there, resale value will remain good, and weather sealing should hopefully keep dust and junk from getting inside this lens.

I believe this is one of the best lens for about $1000. Forget about zoom lenses even if they are L. This lens is far better than 70-200L in my opinion. It is very sharp at f2 and even more sharp at f2.5. With zoom lenses you have to set to f/5.6 for better result and f/8 to match this lens. It is very well built but not excessive heavy, come with hood and bag, but unfortunately, Canon have decided to remove the hard cases for all the L lenses.

Combined with a Tamron 1.4X teleconverter this lens provide very good optical quality on par with any zoom L lenses at 189mm focal length. Yes I know I lost the convenience of a 70-200 zoom lens. But I am really happy that I decide to change the plan of buying a 70-200IS to 135/2L+1.4X. This not only saves me the money but also let me to get better pictures, especially at wide open. Better portrait lenses, like 200/1.8 and 300/2.8, would cost several thousands of dollars. Trust me, once you play with primes, you will not like zoom anymore.

I am also using a 24-70L to shoot my small kid. After using this lens, I don't like it anymore and thinking about change to primes someday, the only reason preventing me doing that is the 1.6X crop factor of digital camera. A 35mm/1.4L will become 56mm which is really not good.

Order from Amazon with free shipping even though it says not in stock. They shipped mine in 2 days and this happened before even though item stated "in stock soon".

Pros:
Very sharp at f2 and super sharp start from f2.5.
Very fast lens with f/2
Very good bokeh (background blurring).
Overall extremely good picture quality with good contrast/color.
Smaller size, less weight and black color compare to those white 70-200s.
It is a L lens: best build quality, fast/quiet ring USM AF with FTM.


Cons:
No hard case.
No inexpensive.
Effective focal length is 216mm on 10D/20D/Rebel/300D which is a little difficult to use for portrait

I recently bought this lens amid trepidation that the 85mm focal length would overwhelm the x1.6 crop factor of my Digital Rebel XL. My worries were needless: just a step or two back from the subject plus some getting used to the telephoto perspective were enough to turn this lens into the most effective portrait lens that I have.  When attached to my EOS Elan 7n film camera, however, the lens really truly comes into its own, as the full frame 35mm SLR delivers the entire focal range of this lens.  The focused image is incredibly crisp compared to any other non-L grade lens.  And I agree that this lens deserves the red ring of courage around it, like the L lenses have.  This glass is absolutely essential in a very short list of affordable lenses, and should give many of the non-affordable ones a run for their money. Solidly built too, with an old-fashioned no-nonsense look to it.  I highly recommend it

The controls are a little complicated to get used to, especially the all-manual settings -- which should by definition be easy to use -- but overall this camera is very rugged and very capable.  After I bought it, I took the D10 to Budapest, Hungary.  I had a great view of the Danube and set my camera up for night shots.  It did a brilliant job.  How about this:  take a digital night shot (use the largest image size possible), use a 300mm lense and blow the results up to 24x30 through Shutterfly.com. Image remained amazingly sharp. Colors were fantastic.  The camera made it easy to look like a pro. The only gripe I have with this camera is that I wish it had a black and white setting like other less expensive Canon digitals, but this can be overcome with software so it's not a huge issue.  The price is great, it has a magnesium body (vs. the Rebel's plastic body).  You get a lot of the D1/D20/D30, without the cost

This is one of the four cameras, the only digital camera, I used to learn portrait photography.  The class was on how to take portraits not how to use the camera. I wanted to graduate from the point and shoot but had to consider my budget because I wanted an SLR film camera also.  I got the Canon Rebel Ti packed with two lenses. It made sense to me to purchase a Canon digital to interchange lenses. My original choice was the Canon Digital Rebel, however, in my  WEB search, I found the EOS 10D for $750 with no catch.  There were no required additional purchases scam when I called.  This allowed me to spend the extra money I would have spent on the camera on accessories.  

Since it's digital, I am not shy about trying out the features.     When I first got the camera, some of the photos were dark or very light. After tinkering around and learning what the sensor-indicators means I don't get that anymore. 

The 10D is more camera than I need that I'm sure I will have it for a long time.

I'm sure there are those who'd wax philosophical over the subject of filters and how one brand is "much better" than another, but for my Canon EF-S 10-22mm on a 20D, I figure Canon would be fairly good at making a filter that they're willing to have branded "Canon." It fits fine, doesn't interfere with the lens hood, looks clear, seems to attenuate that nasty ultra-violet part of the light spectrum and perhaps best of all, protects the front element. What more would one want

This is a good, affordable UV filter for protecting your expensive lenses.  I leave it on my lens all the time.  This particular filter (L-39 Sharp Cut) is especially good for wide angle lenses (&lt; 24mm focal length), because of its ultrathin profile, which prevents vignetting.  I have used regular filters on wide angle lenses, with very bad results.  Although this filter is NOT multi-coated, I have not found it to be a big deal in the pictures I've taken.  Multi-coated UV filters can cost 2x or 3x the price of this one, which I don't think is worthwhile.  All in all, I recommend this filter for Canon or non-Canon lenses

This is a very powerful flash unit that works as a master to other Canon flash units. You can get very nice results with a small amount of experimentation. It does what it suppose to. I used it with the 420EX I've had for several years and it worked fine. Mounted on the camera it's a larger version of the built in popup on the 30d with some extra niceties and lots more power. Thinking of the 430EX? Cough up the few extra bucks for this baby, you'll be glad you did. It's a one shot deal, [no pun intended], you'll be using it for years to come. I bought the 420EX for my Elan II E about 6 years ago. It's been a great unit. This one recharges  faster and has gobs more power. You'll love it! Don't let all the dials and switches scare you, read the instruction manual

I didn't have a ton of time to research this flash. I've used it now on several occasions with my Canon 5D and couldn't be happier with it. It's great for shooting portraits. I can shoot 10 shots in a row and the flash keeps up. I would definitely purchase the plastic diffuser - get's rid of the typical flash harsh light

I use this little gadget mainly for macro and portrait work.  When you have it on the light emitting from the flash is diffused which gives you a more flattering less contrasty light to illuminate your subjects with.  Unless you are going for a very shadowy, high-contrast, image this diffuser can save the day.  It is very light weight and easy to pack in small places, so you should never have a good reason to leave it behind.  Sometimes it is the simple things that make the biggest difference in a photo, and using this can defiantly make very noticeable differences

I have been using my Sony Cybershot DSCN1 8.1MP for about a month now. It's so easy to use.  And, I love how you can easily delete picture via the touch screen.  The only issue I have with it, is that I can't use the Memory Pro Stick with my Sony photo printer (a 5 year old model), because the stick is not compatible. 

ps: don't forget to buy a memory stick pro if you purchase this camera. you're gonna need it.

This, in my very humble opinion, is the most useful, the sharpest, and just about anything else good you can think of say, best wide angle lense ever produced by anybody, anytime, anywhere. Lightning fast and that's what you want when the light is low.

My gal pal Sara and I have often wandered the Caribbean islands in the dawn's early light, as she is into shooting old homes. She particularly likes the gingerbread homes in Marigot, on the French side of St. Martin. I swear she must have them all on her hard drive. It's like an obsession with her and this lens aids her passion, feeds into her manic desire to try and control the light.

She just loves it and since I love her, I gotta love it too. Seriously though, I've used the lense quite a bit myself and it's a keeper if ever there was one. You just go wrong with a Canon "L" lense, no siree.

When I bought this camera the sales people tried to get me to buy another battery.  They said the one that came with it would only be good for about 20 minutes.  Now I have bought alot of items in my lifetime, a 20 min battery on a camera just doesnt seem like a very good "business" choice.  So I said no.  So I got the camera, charged the battery until the light went green (which sucked because I wanted to play with it right when i got it) and started taking pictures (oh I also got a 2G CF) worked great....so I planned to go up a mountain and take soem scenery shots.  Keeping in mind what the sales person had told me I pocketed the charger just incase.  Well, 6000', 300 pictures, and 5 hours later the camera is still running strong, still have 200 shots left for the trip home, battery life indicator hasnt budged off of the full button.  So all in all, I think the battery life is great, now i can see if your taking say thousands of pictures all in a row you may need another but for just going on a trip and shooting a few pictures at every stop point, the original will work fine.  as for the quality of photos.....i love them

I like using a tripod with my long zoom lens, and this device has really added to my hobby.  The remote is perfect for taking pictures of birds in my birdbath and squirrels and other critters in my yard.  I personally don't like cables, I don't like dealing with them.  This is just right for my purposes.

The remote is also better for taking pics of people.  It is much better than a timer in my opinion since I can move people in and out easier and more efficiently, taking pictures more quickly.  This gives me so much more control than using a timer.

This is a great camera.  Plenty of resolution. Excellent shot speed.  Sturdy frame.  The kit lense doesn't do the camera justice.  Buy the body separate and add a better lense.

On the bad side, I had a small glitch with the camera's firmware soon after purchase and had to return it for a fix.  It was two months before the camera was returned.  Sorry, Canon...  you lose a star for that

I have gone from the old 640x480 about nine years ago to a 3.1m for the last few years to the Canon 20d now, what a pleasure to shot. The battery life has not been an issue even with over 250 shots, which should be sufficient for most anybody. There is a small learning curve but you would expect this with any new camera.
The lens choice was a great idea which came from an earlier review of the excellent walk around ability of this lens from the general shots to the closeups of those favorite flowers.
For those individuals who are on the fence about this product I tout it to all I have spoken to. It turned a good photo experience on our west coast road trip into a real serious photo shoot, it also uses the commonly accessable compact flash.
The built in flash works well have not had to explore the options at this time. The delivery of this item when promised was a nice bow on the package

I read many reviews at fredmiranda.com before I purchased this lens and I was not dissapointed one bit. I was lucky enough to receive a very sharp copy of this lens on the first try. The macro shots were very sharp and contrasty. The center part is already reaching near maximum sharpness at F2.8  Anything beyond F4 is tack sharp. Be carefull with this lens though. The DOF at F2.8 is extremely narrow. Don't mistaken the out of focus shots for being unsharp. Focus properly and crank up the aperture and you'll get some very satisfying macro shots. The only thing I wish this lens had was image stabilizer. Canon, how about a 100mm macro with IS?

Don't listen to the reviews that claim that this lens is not a good choice for cropped sensor cameras (IE the 20D, 30D, Rebels etc) the Canon L lens are the best and this particular lens is no exception. I have had the lens for less than 24 hours now and am in love with the sharpness and color already. 

Great lens, great color, so well built, super sharp, just watch out if this is your first L lens, you'll be hooked.

This is a lens you will have for many years, great investment

I shoot with a Canon 20D and have used the Canon EF 75-300mm f/4.5-5.6 III USM lens. I've always noticed the limitations of this lens when shooting amateur softball. I reviewed the lens lineup at the Canon website and decided on the Canon EF 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6L USM Lens. The 100-400mm is a great lens, but it can be a bit soft.  For that reason I decided to add the Canon EF 70-200mm 2.8/f IS USM telephoto zoom lens to my lens collection. 

This is a serious lens meant for serious photographers. Being an L lens, there is a lot of features and is manufactured with better materials with a high level of dust and moisture resistance. The construction is sturdy and consists of 23 elements in 18 groups.  The four Super UD-glass elements largely eliminate the secondary spectrum reducing residual chromatic aberration. An improved 8-blade circular aperture offers a more pleasing out-of-focus image.  The Canon EF 70-200mm lens weighs in at about 3.24 lbs/1,470 g, and accepts 77mm filters with a minimal focusing distance of 4.3 ft/1.3 m.  This lens is compatible with the extenders 1.4x II and 2x II.  Be sure to get a good quality UV haze filter to protect the front lens element.

Being white, this lens looks a bit strange, but helps keep it stay cool when shooting in the sun. Some people are concerned that being white, it attracts attention to criminals. From my experience, my 20D attracts attention regardless of what lens I put on it. In addition, I most likely have a camera bag and tripod/monopod with me to further attract attention.  I personally doubt a thief looking for something to steal is taking the time to evaluate the cost of the item and are more concerned with the ease of taking something they can unload. I try to make things difficult for would be thieves and have insurance as a back up. 

The dual IS system has two modes. Mode 1 is for stationary subjects while mode two is for moving subjects. It is recommended that the IS function is not used on a tripod; however I have used it on my monopod with success. The IS helps to eliminate camera shake and helps stabilize the lens when shooting from a moving vehicle. While there are limitations to what the IS can do, it can give you a few extra stops. Just keep in mind, the IS attempts to eliminate camera movement, not the movement of the subject being photographed. 

This lens permits for auto or manual focus depending on how the switch is set. There is also a switch to shift from a 1.4m/4.6ft to infinity or 2.5m/8.2ft to infinity. 

Included with this lens are the Tripod mount, lens hood, and storage case. The tripod mount is the best option to use when mounting to a tripod. This helps to balance the load. Mounting the camera instead creates an unbalanced set up that may topple over. The case is a zippered soft case (LZ1324) that can also be purchased separately. The lens hood (ET-86) is used to reduce lens flare and can protect the front element in certain situations.  Often times, Amazon recommends purchasing the lens case and hood, however they are normally included with the lens.

The Canon EF 70-200mm is such an awesome lens, it almost fails to compare to the Canon EF 75-300mm.  The Canon 100-400mm lens is a well used option for me, but the clarity and sharpness of the 70-200mm IS lens is more refined. The auto-focus is quiet and quick. This lens can be used for portraits, landscape, sports or as a general walk about lens.  The f/2.8L combined with the IS makes this a good option for certain low light situations.  The features add creative versatility. The Canon EF 70-200mm IS lens comes at a price, but it is worth every bit of it. 

PROS: 
Incredible clarity and sharpness 
Quiet and quick auto-focus 
Features add creative versatility 
Dual IS system 

CONS: 
Heavy and bulky (This should be expected with these types of lenses

Nick Xu, if you can't figure out the difference between this lens, and the cheaper consumer grade lenses, by all means, stay with the cheaper consumer grade lenses. After all, "Mr Magoo" of cartoon fame couldn't tell a Chevy from a Rolls Royce. All kidding aside, this lens is simply awesome in use. Having one of these lenses in a camera bag is very close in practice to owning three or four high end prime lenses. Yes, it's that good. 

I am using a borrowed version right now, but as soon as I pay off my new 24-105 f/4 L IS USM lens (very, very awesome), I will buy my own  70-200 f/2.8 IS USM. It's as good as it gets in this lens range, but if you feel comfortable with a pinhole camera, carry on, as it's all about the end user.

For everyone else, this lens is the Holy Grail of mid range telephoto lenses. It is simply the best available in it's range, and responds well to Canon tele adapters. If you can figure out a way to afford this lens, buy it, as it is all that. If you are a Nikon lover buy this lens anyway, and buy a fairly cheap 20D body to make it work. It's OK to tell your friends that you used a Nikon to take the pics, but you will end up knowing that Canon is the premeir lens crafter of the 21'st century.

(Sorry, Nikon fans, but this lens stands all by it's self in the grand scheme of things. It's simply awesome.)

I bought this lens on a whim to see what it would be like to shoot with a prime lens. At $80 it certainly was worth the risk unlike the many other Canon lenses which cost thousands of dollars. The quality of the pictures from this lens is the only thing making me move away from zoom lenses

For the money, you absolutely can't beat this lens.  It's very fast and sharp.  Not fast to focus, but what do you expect at $70?  I have four lenses , some costing 4x's as much as this one...yet I use this one the most.  Anyone looking to step up from the kit lens, or anyone looking to buy a camera body w/out the kits lens should look to buy this lens

This is a great lens for star fields. It is about the least expensive lens canon makes and also one of the fastest. The focus was sharp to the corners without coma. See my photo of a portion the Milky Way. This was obtained with a 30sec exposure with a Rebel XT on an inexpensive clock drive sitting on a picnic table

I have had my Canon Eos 30D for about a week and after 500 shutter actuations I am completely addicted to photography.  I bought the 17-85mm Canon lens and it takes phenomenal pics especially using the software and post-processing in RAW.  I also have a 70-300mm lens for sports/outdoors/nature and bursts of 5fps are a beautiful sound.  I bought the Camera through Dell and with rebates currently this is the best deal out there!  Strongly recommend.  Pay the extra $$$ and get this over the Rebel XTI.  You won't be disappointed

I upgraded from the Canon Digital Rebel (grey body) to this because I was ready to take my photography to a new level. One thing I like most about this camera is it's flash compenstation. I purchased the 430ex flash with it because I was tired of having to use the built in flash and always getting those hard shadows on the wall

Hoods offer several benefits to the photographer. Primarily the hood shades the lens from stray light that may result in an unwanted discoloration or hazing of the image, or the appearance of lens flare. Shading your lens helps improve contrast and image quality. A hood is not required to eliminate these problems, as any item used to shade the lens will provide the same protection from stray light. The hood is convenient in that it is built to offer protection while ensuring that it will not inadvertently find its way into your image. 

Photographers often state the protective abilities of a hood as a reason to have one. This hood being a solid petal shaped offers limited protection from keeping moisture and wind blown debris off the from lens element. When in place, the hood can protect the lens from impacting solid objects. Being shallow and petal shaped, this type of protection is also limited. Even if the protection is limited, replacing a damaged hood is usually cheaper than repairing the lens and easier to replace. 

This hood is manufactured for the Canon 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS EF and normally is not included with the lens when sold new.  Amazon often suggests purchasing one with your lens, and is worth considering. 

Since the hood is wider than the lens; it can easily be stored attached in a reverse position. This doesn't add to the length of the lens, but does make it wider by about an inch. An inch may not seem like a lot, but in a tightly packed camera bag, it is huge. This lens itself isn't unusually wide so the extra inch may not be a problem. 

While the protective benefits exist, they are secondary and limited. I find the impact the hood has on my image quality to be the more convincing reason to use a hood.  Considering the impact on image quality and the low cost as compared to my other camera equipment (except for a lens case), purchasing a hood is money well spent.

PROS: 
Improves contrast and image quality 
Reduces lens flare problems 
Offers limited protection to the lens 

CONS: 
Takes up more space in your camera bag to store with the lens

This is a wonderful bag for the photographer that wants a light weight bag that can still hold a lot of lenses or bodies.  The bag slings around to the front allowing the user to easily switch out lenses without having to unload the entire bag or worry about dropping an expensive lense.  Also, the bag can hold a lot of accessories.  I had to Canon Rebel XT bodies and 3 lenses in just the camera compartment.  The flap that opens up to the user when the bag is on your chest has the memory card holder, but it hold 8 memory cards which is huge!  The top has a small pouch where you can tuck away larger objects like a water bottle or map.  The all weather bag cover is built into the bag so you do not have to worry about folding it up and storing it.  The bag cover also has velcro pulls that latches it onto the bag so that it stays on insuring a dry environment inside the bag.  Basically this is a top notch bag that can get through anything.  Yes, I have actually used the bag on a few trips and find it very user friendy and reasonable

The case opens partially on the side to allow removal of the camera only. Then after unclicking the fasteners you can unzip the rest of the case to allow for access to lenses. It makes it easy if you only want to remove the camera. You can swing the bag around while wearing it and pull the camera out without taking off the pack.

My digital Rebel XT fits with the Canon Battery grip and my macro lens attached, however it would not fit with my 200mm lens attached. 

My Canon Speedlight flash did not fit well in the lense section but fits perfectly in the separate section at the top portion of the bag. The lenses all fit nicely allowing for several lenses depending on the size of them. 

I bought a regular Lowepro camera bag, but found that it was awkward to place the camera in with lens attached. This bag is designed to have the camera with a lens. 

If you search Google images for the Lowepro Slingshot 200 you will see what I mean about the side unzipping to allow the camera removal.

This UV filter does it job to protect the lens well. The build is solid (metal construction). The glass is also descent quality. 

About the performance, it absorbs some UV light. The UV light absorbtion is hardly noticeable, probably the sky 1-A and the haze filter version will absorb more UV light than this lens which is fine for me. 

Now, about the one problem which is the internal reflection. I've heard many people say that it mostly happens during night or low light shooting. I found out that it is not caused directly by the low light/night situation. The internal reflection will appear when there is a strong/bright source of light in comparison to the overall exposure (the surrounding environment). To put it in example (which hopefully is easier to understand), when you take a picture of a lamp during nightime and the light is much brighter than the surrounding area then you will see the internal reflection. as you move the position of the light to be closer to the sides/corner of the picture (and not in the center of the picture), the internal reflection reduces and finally dissapear (if you move the light far enough from the center). And if the light isn't too bright/contrast compare to the surrounding environment then there will be no internal reflection. but of course most of the time, a lamp at nightime is often very bright. But the point that I'm trying to make is that the internal reflection doesn't happen all the time during low light or night time. 

Additionally, the internal reflection isn't only happening at night. it can also happen in the afternoon if you are taking a picture of a sun for example. basically same rule as above, on how bright is the light source compared to the surrounding area, and as you move the sun from the center of the photo and near the side the internal reflection will move to the side/dissapear (also depending the angle). But the best way is just to remove the filter during these situations. 

Hope this explanation helps you to reduce the occurence of internal reflection by identifying correctly when the internal reflection will occur and then remove the filter during those situation (which is not hard to do). 

I'm actually not a fan of lens filter (any filter) as I think it will only degrade picture quality as we added another layer between the sensor and object, but I decided to use them anyway for all my lens. And I would recommend everyone to get one of this filter if you don't have any filter for your lens yet.

My all-around favorite lens in the Canon EOS system is the 50/1.4.  I find that most of the time, most of the pictures I want to take can be achieved using hte 50mm focal length, and the fast aperture allows me to take photos in low light.

I bought the 24-70/2.8 in hopes of getting high quality images from a zoom lens, as a lot of my pictures weren't in particularly dark places, and the flexibility to get a little wider or closer sounded appealing.

I was not disappointed.

The image quality produced by the 24-70/2.8 is outstanding.  Great color, great sharpness.  It might not make images quite as striking as Canon's 135/2 lens, but they are very good indeed.

Does this lens replace the 50/1.4?  No way.  The 50 is a lot smaller, weighs a lot less, and is still much better for low light shooting.  But for photographing events where you don't want to lug around several prime lenses or go to extreme lenghts to frame the shot better, the 24-70 can be a great tool

Just returned from a trip to Hawaii and had the opportunity to put this lens to the test.  I was very pleased with the results.  This is a powerful lens, yet it is relatively light weight and not burdensome to use.  I was able to get some really amazing wild life shots of birds, zooming in from a distance with a hand held camera (Canon EOS 20D) and virtually every shot was a keeper.  The IS feature allows you to quickly zoom and compose your shot and fire it off and the image quality is excellent with sharp focus.  Usually a lens this size with this much power requires a firm grip and almost always a tripod - not so with this one.   I shot in both portrait and landscape mode and I didn't see any problems with focus, clarity or sharpness.  All the images were clean and razor sharp.  If you are looking for a long lens with the ability to bring in a distant shot without having to use tripods and other equipment, I highly recommend this lens for your arsenal.

Make sure to check the compatibility charts to verify that your lenses will work with this before buying it since only a handful of L series lenses are compatible.  If you do already have one or more of these lenses though this is a nice addition.  The AF only works with lenses f/4 and faster on most camera bodies.  You do also give up a little image quality by putting this between your lens and camera body, but the extra reach is really nice

I purchased this at a photographic store because a professional said you shouldn't go higher than 1.4x.  Just keep in mind--1.4x is only "40% better".  It worked really well, but didn't increase the zoomage enough.  I decided to go with a 2x (that's twice the zoomage) teleconverter by kenko instead.  I gave this one to my brother-in-law for Christmas.

You have to think about what you want--I want to get in really close to the birds.  I have a 70-300mm zoom lens and 1.4x takes it to 98-420mm.  It is an improvement, but not nearly enough!  If you want to get twice as close, this isn't going to do it for you.  If you want to get half-again-as close, this almost gets you there.  

As far as quality, the quality is definitely there. Five stars for quality, 3 for insufficient zoomage

I was able to use the Canon EF 1.4X II Extender for some nature photography recently in Wyoming.  I shot elk in low light conditions so I was shooting pretty much wide open.  The extender did not compromise the inherent sharpness of the lens at all.  You could see the hairs on the animals heads.  It's fantastic

This is a good tool, does the job well, and serves the purpose, but is a little overpriced and Canon keeps changing connectors, forcing us to buy new accessories which is a wrong practice against the consumer.  

I give a 4 Star because of Canon, not because of the product.
If you are willing to pay for it, it's a good product.

I already have 2 of the smaller versions for other lenses but wanted to be sure my EFS 17-85-mm would be snug as a bug in its own pouch instead of a cheap felt sling thing. Well, Canon came through again with another of its soft felt line the LP1116. This pouch is thick and has the same firm bottom made of naugahide that protects the inside lens. The cord is strong and silky and doesn't open accidently the way a silky cord would. Obviously we can't throw the pouch around and we have to be careful but it really does the trick and feels good in your hand. The moment I buy another lens, I shall have to buy its matching pouch

I'd be stating the obvious and preaching to the choir if I said that care of lenses for SLR cameras required a decent lens cap.  This one snaps into 58mm threads on the end of many lenses (Canon and otherwise), so just be sure to confirm that that it's the proper size for your lens

Ive gotten used to the disposable kodaks i got from the checkout isle at walmart. The problem with those, though, is that they run out of pictures pretty quick. The last straw was when we ran out of film at the family reunion just as cousin billy was about to show us how to catch a lizard with a rubber band and a twinky. At that point I knew I needed an upgrade.

I ordered the Canon EOS-1Ds Mark II the next day, for [...] The feature that first caught my attention was the powerful zoom. Now when I take a family picture, I like to step back about a mile or two, then zoom in and snap that high-resolution masterpeice. My wife always complains that i zoom too close into the big pores on her nose, to which i respond by suggesting she use clean and clear pore cleansing strips (watch for her upcoming review of those soon). 

Another useful feature of this camera is the continuous shooting mode. This is where the camera automatically takes pictures in rapid succession, about 5 per second. The other day I set the camera on the dresser, turned on the macarena, and got wild. I then took the individual pictures and strung them together into an animated flipbook. Now watching myself do the macarena is a mere flip of the book away. Man i can dance.

To summarize, you will have a lot of fun with this cam like i did. Definitely worth the [...] ! But remember, there is a [...] that comes with it; so make sure you fill in the item number clearly on the [...] card, and make sure you stay within the space alloted on the form otherwise the [...] wont go through

This camera has the potential for pictures with amazing clarity and colors but not straight out of the camera. 

I too was disappointed after converting the RAW files with C1 Pro and ACR. Was it possible that my D-Rebel would be better than this monster that gives me neck pains and has made my right arm to start looking like Swartzenegger's arm? Even with L glass the results were dissapointing. 

The problem is not with the camera but with the workflow. After using it for 2 months I am getting used to a workflow that will give me the results I am looking for. I had to realize that this camera does not perform any processing enhancements in camera because the pros need to do it themselves. Once I got over the fact that I would have to sharpen and saturate colors a lot more than before I was content and have never touched the D-Rebel ever since.

PS Beware of the severe neck pains when attaching any L zoom lens. Buy the hand strap or a better neck strap.

I gave this monopod to my boyfriend, as a gift, and it's been perfect for his use.  He videotapes his kids's baseball and softball games, and was tired of holding the camcorder for so long.  He didn't want to deal with a bulky tripod when he was getting up and down, so a monopod seemed like a great idea.  He has LOVED it!!  He says it keeps the camera very steady and it's very easy to change the height so he can use it sitting or standing.  He's no professional, but he uses his camcorder a lot, and he'll be happily using the monopod for a long time

If you've found these reviews, you already know this lens is one of the best Canon products out there. I did not bite on the IS version, and I have not found myself ever wishing I did; this lens is everything it's hyped up to be and performs well in low-light/indoor situations.

I don't think it's weight is that big a deal. I really don't have any problem carrying this lens around for a day -- in my hands or in a bag -- even with a 1.4 extender attached. It can feel a bit heavy but I don't mind, and neither will you when you see the results later on.

I've used this a lot for shooting professional baseball and it's landed me front page ink several times. In my mind, I could get the 1.4 extender with this lens and give myself a 70-280 range, which is pretty adequate for most sports and nature photography, considering the 300 f/2.8 and it's friends are much, much more expensive. The lens works basically just as fast and sharp, in my opinion, with the 1.4 at f/4, although some may debate this. Flip on any baseball or football game and you will see this lens around the neck of most every pro.

If you can swing the price, enjoy it! My advice is to continue reading up on this or similar products, although I found most everyone agreed, this is one of the finest lens around. It's one that makes people stop and stare and wonder who you are

my cousin's wife is a professional studio photographer who occasionally lends out her lenses to me for clothing / lifestyle photoshoots (I've been pretty active in this area for some time, just now starting to go full digital), and I've used the f/2.8L about four or five times and this is one of the best lenses I've used. period. shooting wide open allows you to retain high shutter speeds for night shots, as well as get very interesting and vibrant long shutter shots (of crowds, the freeway at night, etc). when shooting action shots, the tripod mount can get in the way of zooming and focusing, but it can be removed easily enough.

I personally just purchased the f/4.0L, which, coupled with a relatively wide max aperture and shooting at either 1600 or 3200 on my 20D, should do nicely, but I still rate the 2.8 high up on my list

This is the first IS lens that I've owned. I had trouble justifying the extra expense but am now quite pleased that I took the step up. 

Keep in mind that tis is an EF not EF-S lens. This makes its effective focal length about 45-215mm on my Digital Rebel.

I love the zoom range (great for shooting action shots of kids without getting in their faces) and the ability to easily control the depth of field on my nature shots.

Just uploaded some of my recent shots with this lens under "Share your own customer images".

I bought the Rebel XT w/ the 18-55 lens exactly 18 hours before the XTI was introduced, but that's another story. As this is my first DSLR, I was blown away by the results. But after the initial euphoria, there is always room for improvement. My first choice was the 28-200, favoring the longer zoom over the IS, but I found this one used at Penn Camera and got a deal on it and a 380EX flash, so the decision was made for me. 
I like the zoom range, it's great for framng portraits. If I need wider angle, I still have the kit lens. 
I won't make the usual complaints about the herky-jerky zoom ring or the rackety extension tubes, as I was prepared for this by these reviews before I ever saw the lens.
I'm no expert on sharpness, and still trying to get myself dialed in, but my shots so far look pretty sharp to me. I have no "L" lenses to compare to, nor would I make the comparison if I did. 
In my somewhat uninformed opinion, this is a great step up from the kit lens. This is a lens a working guy can afford and most likely get great results with. Being a working guy, I'm extremely happy with it so far, and glad I made the purchase.

Best (compromise for an) Exploration Camera

5 frames per second is barely enough to capture dolphins - hence the 8 + fps of the EOS 1 was desired
</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
I had been waiting 3 years for any manufacturer to market a camera similar in specification to the Canon EOS1. As exploration Health, Safety & Environment advisor, work takes me to middle of the desert or the oceans. The wait was for 35mm film quality, with speed of picture taking (5 frames per second is barely enough to capture dolphins - hence the 8 + fps of the EOS 1 was desired). There was a parallel wait for an Image Stabilised 28-300 zoom lens.

Let's cut the story short. If I want a camera to bring on holiday, it would not be this one - the battery and charger are too heavy and bulky; instead I would choose the EOS20D without hesitation.

But having hundreds of failed 35mm film frames I decided not to wait any longer but to buy the EOS1D Mark II because the 1Ds Mark II is not fast enough at 4 frames a second.

With 35mm cameras, after a few seconds on the shooting, I would have to run back inside to the cabin (of a ship) to change film. If there is large enough memory card in the EOS1DII, there is no need. This camera is built with seals against the environment (and so does the 28-300mm lens). Instead of being scared of running out of film, now it is easy to keep the shutter button pressed while panning (and hoping) the dolphins do their jumps into the air.

With the 28-300mm lens attached, there is no need to change lenses either. Dolphins riding the bow wave of the ship could be captured at 28mm while those further away could be caught with 300mm setting.

It is a disappointment that the battery is not LiOn but the older NiMH. But as with any photo gear requiring a battery it is wise to have a spare, whatever the substance. I just wish Canon package a small travel size charger instead of the standard one which is very bulky. It has connections for two batteries (yet it could only charge one following the other) but most people would be happy using one battery while the other one is being charged. You just try to convince some airport officials to let you on the plane with the above kit, binoculars, laptop, mobile phone, GPS.......ext. hard disk....as hand luggage.

For work, I am committed and therefore bear the weight and troubles of hauling the hardware. But for holidays, I would choose the EOS20D with built-in flash because who would want to lug around 3 kilos all day plus flash gun and possibly a tripod?

The camera gets 4.5 stars but the battery and charger lets it down. Why just 4.5 stars ? One of the beauties I had thought with digital SLR was not having to do anything in processing, just transfer the images to the computer. Wrong. The .jpg straight out of the camera is not sharp enough. Post processing is required. Why ? Why is that necessary when the Canon S60 (which I use for different assignments (with underwater housing)) doesn't need to ? That defeats the point of having a .jpg file at 5.5 Meg when the 1.5 Meg of the S60 looks sharper straight out of the camera ? Still, there is RAW if the standard output is not suficient.

Incidentally, the EOS1DsII also produces 5.5 Meg .jpg and those also require post processing. For those of us who are not interested in working longer than necessary (me) 16.7 Million Pixels would seem a bit wasted.

I am still waiting for the camera which produces sharp .jpg files in-camera without having to post process, and can shoot at 8+ fps with a sensor size equivalent to 35mm film. Meantime I shall have to learn to shoot with RAW files and post process.

Also incidentally, the sensor size of the EOS20D is smaller, which means although itself is lighter than the EOS1D series camera, having to carry around an extrawide lens is not my idea of fun on holiday. The magnification ratio for the EOS1DII is 1.3 whereas the EOS20D is 1.6. This means I could still travel reasonably light (compromise) with the 1DII and 28-135mm IS lens attached. Sure it is possible to use stitching but that is more time spent at the computer and time is precious.

Any regrets ? None what-so-ever. It is state of the technology at the moment. Another benefit of using digital is that, it doesn't matter if you had been shooting ISO 100 all day. come the night if you want to shoot the rig with a moon as backdrop, just change to ISO 1600 without having to bother about "pushing2 the film in developing. It's a beauty when an IS L lens is attached. You'd need IS when there is machinery vibrations and the ship is moving with the swell ! Good job Canon. Now you need to shoe horn in a more capable CPU (to process the images in-camera), fit the 1DsII sensor into this one or this motordrive into the 1DsII and you may persuade me to part with more cash.

I recently purchased this for use with my 550EX. If you use alot of flash for event photography, you will want this in your kit. It is expensive, but I think it is worth every penny. It will keep you from changing AAs in your strobe and it quickens the recycle times to nearly instant. You can shoot bursts and still get the proper flash exposure. You can attach a strap to sling it over your shoulder or slip it on your belt. Mounting on my 20D was just not comfortable. It gets in the way of the hand-grip

This lens is great. I've been doing portraits and just random snapshots and it makes every picture beautiful! The only downside is the lack of ability to zoom. Other than that it's a great lens

This is a great lens for any user, professional or amateur.  This lens offers incredibly wide focal lengths all while giving very impressive/clean results.  A slight distortion is noticeable when shooting at 10mm (16mm cropped) but this is easily correctable with software.  In addition, the very fast and absolutely silent USM is a huge plus.  I highly recommend this lens to anyone wanting great landscapes or great in door/architecture shots (especially realtors)

Many great things have already been said about this lens, and I will support them!

My copy delivers outstanding sharpness (nearly on par with my 24-70L) even *wide open* (rare for a wide angle of all but the finest German manufacturers), great color, very little distortion (many objective tests have revealed that it's probably the "best of breed" ultra wide angle), and impressive contrast. Surprisingly, the build quality is not bad: tight fitting mount, damped rings, and no jiggles or rattles.

If I were forced to offer a (slight) negative, it would be the bokeh of the lens is somewhat "marbly"...However, when shooting a subject with an OOF area differential high enough to make bokeh a component of the frame, then the subject is likely going to demand far more attention than the bokeh! ;)

A fine lens, Canon: definitely worth the premium over the Sigma and Tokina rivals (both of which I sampled before purchasing this optic)

I had the Tokina 12-24 f4 and it was a great sharp lens. This Canon focuses faster and is wider. If you're worried about full frame in the future don't be. Just buy this lens and enjoy the ultra wide images. It light, fast and sharp. "L" quality pictures. The build could be better but I don't see any problems down the road.

If you don't need the speed or can't afford the expensive 85mm f1.4 Nikkor lens or both, then this lens may be the right one for you. It took Nikon a while to produce a superb compact 85mm lens, but this time they finally got it right. Without a doubt, this is a fine portrait lens for photographing head-and-shoulder portraits (The only lens which is optically better is Nikon's legendary 105mm f2.5 Nikkor lens, and its close optical twin, the 105mm f2.8 Micro Nikkor.). Since the 105mm f2.5 Nikkor lens doesn't have an autofocus version, then this might be the perfect moderate telephoto lens for owners of Nikon autofocus SLR cameras. Regardless, this lens has a well-earned reputation for excellent contrast and resolution

This is original equipment battery charger manufactered by Canon. The performance of the charger is excellent as are most Canon products. The price paid was comparible to non-sale priced items puchased via internet sites. The item was recieved in original packaging, 3 days after placing the order, was new (not reconditioned with a new appearance). I am extremely pleased with the entire purchase process experienced, from the information given at the site to ease of ordering and fast shipping

Slightly smaller than the charger that comes with the S(40,45,50,...) series cameras and the digital rebel series cameras.  Seems to charge in about the same time.  Feels a bit more substantial, but that's not saying much as the chargers that come with those cameras seem pretty flimsy.  I can't give it 5 stars because it does nothing more than the chargers that come with the cameras (which I lost)

I bought this lens to go with my Canon Digital Rebel XT.  I absolutely love this lens.  I got it to try some insect and other macro shots and it has served this purpose very well.  With some practice this lens will produce fantastic macros with some great bokeh to boot.  
I read the other reviews and must say that I have never scared an insect away with the noise as mentioned before.  And I have taken countless insect shots with this lens.  It is a bit louder than the other lenses I have but I don't see it to be a problem.  The one problem I do encounter is when using the autofocus in a busy closeup scene it often will focus on the background instead of say a closer insect on a flower.  When this happens I just flip it to manual and focus that way.  No big deal.
Overall, great lens for an even greater price.  Definitely worth it.  (I submitted a photo of a bee that I took a couple of days ago with this lens as an example.)

I purchased this lens back in March of 2005 to shoot static "Warhammer models" with my 10D.  I found that longer lenses such as the Sigma 105mm, the Canon EF 100mm, and the Tamron SP Autofocus 90mm all were "too long" with the 10D's 1.6 focal crop and would result in requiring me to use a lot more physical space that what I had room for to get the shot.

The Canon EF 50mm f/2.5 is nearly a perfect match with the 10D for this purpose.  Its small, its compact, and its short focal length do not require that I be standing three feet away from the model I'm shooting.

As far as shooting at non-static objects, such as insects, the lens is slow to focus and loud, in both noise and vibration, which results in "startled" subjects and missed shots.

The same also applies for non-macro shots as well.  Its slow focus makes it a poor choice for action photography, and its loud enough to draw attention to you when you are attempting other shots as well

This is a great camera that takes the place of an earlier Canon Digital Elph that I lost several years ago. The 7.1 megapixels ensures great quality and the 3x zoom provides crisp clear pictures. In fact the digital zoom also works great - just make sure the camera is steady (I purchased a nice compact monopod and the results were awesome). Although the image stabilization feature on the newer models would have been great to have, you can't beat the price and overall quality of this camera and the pictures it takes. The Canon SD500 is a great little camera

Hoods offer several benefits to the photographer. Primarily the hood shades the lens from stray light that may result in an unwanted discoloration or hazing of the image, or the appearance of lens flare. Shading your lens helps improve contrast and image quality. A hood is not required to eliminate these problems, as any item used to shade the lens will provide the same protection from stray light. The hood is convenient in that it is built to offer protection while ensuring that it will not inadvertently find its way into your image. 

Photographers often state the protective abilities of a hood as a reason to have one. This hood being a solid conical two inch long offers some protection from keeping moisture and wind blown debris off the from lens element. There is nothing more irritating than reviewing your images to find dust spots or other flaws. When in place, the hood can protect the lens from impacting solid objects. Replacing a damaged hood is usually cheaper than repairing or replacing a lens. 

This hood is manufactured for the Canon 85 f/1.8 USM EF, 100 f/2.0 USM EF, 135 f/2.8 USM EF, 100-300 f/4.5-5.6 USM EF lenses and normally is not included with the lens when sold new.  Amazon often suggests purchasing one with your lens, and is worth considering.  

Since the hood is wider than the lens; it can easily be stored attached in a reverse position. This doesn't add to the length of the lens, but does make it wider by about an inch. An inch may not seem like a lot, but in a tightly packed camera bag, it is huge. Fortunately Canon provides a storage case with the lens that can be used in addition to your camera bag. 

While the protective benefits exist, they are secondary and limited. I find the impact the hood has on my image quality to be the more convincing reason to use a hood. Considering the impact on image quality and the low cost as compared to my other camera equipment (except for a lens case), purchasing a hood is money well spent.

PROS: 
Improves contrast and image quality 
Offers limited protection to the lens 

CONS: 
Takes up more space in your camera bag to store with the len

I bought this hood after reading elsewhere that it fits the 50mm f/1.8 Mark I (the version with the metal mount and distance scale) that I purchased recently.  Canon specs the discontinued ES-65 hood for this lens.  The great thing about this ET-65III is that it is longer, so it blocks more stray light without vignetting on full-frame or 1/6-frame slrs.  The interior on this mark III version is also flocked, providing a bit more light absorption.

I've used those collapsible rubber hoods before while in college, but this hood is definitely worth the investment:  well built, fits backward on the lens for storage (but too long while the lens is on the camera), and provides good protection for the front of the lens (it's quite deep).

Note that this will NOT fit the newer 50mm f/1.8 Mark II version (all plastic mount with no distance scale)

The POWER-2000 XP-333 charges batteries in pairs, with one LED per pair, not as described.  The XP-555 charges each battery independently and slightly faster (3 vs 4 hours).  The XP-333 charger is very lightweight, the XP-555 is slightly heavier.   They work on 110 or 220 V and includes plug adaptors for round European type plugs.  I have used the XP-333 in the USA and overseas.  POWER-2000 makes several other charger models as well.  

The XP-333 and 555 AAs are 2500 mAh, and there are XP-33327 and XP-55527 versions now available with 2700 mAh batteries.  AAA batteries charge faster as they hold less charge.  AAAs from Power-2000 currently come in 850 and 1000 mAh capacities.  

I believe that these capacities for AA and AAA from POWER-2000 and other NiMH makers are twice as great or maybe more than alkalines.  As I recall, some years ago Duracell copper top AAs have 1100 mAh.  I have not found recent figures on the web, but got the old figure by calling the 800 number on the Duracell packages.  Duracell Ultras appear to have a bit higher mAh figure, but I do not know that that is.  

The 1.2 V for NiMH vs 1.5 V for alkalines seems to make no practical difference as I am told, and I believe it is correct, that alkaline voltage drops rapidly under 1.5 V after initial use while I understand that the NiMH holds its 1.2 V value for some time.

I won the Kodak printer at a scrapbook convention & then went on the hunt to find the refills at a reasonable price. Purchasing the 160 count made the price per print the lowest & beat out anything I could find in the local stores. It is a great convenience to be able to whip out a 4x6 print instead of having to download it to a store's website, wait a few days, go there & pick it up, etc. Great value

Hi have a Rebel Extreme, and needed to use the high-speed mode... but the flash couldn't even vaguely keep up.  I was taking pictures of dancers, so needed a flash system that could keep up.  The Speedlite really does this perfectly - I'm able to take a rapid-fire sequence of photos, and this flash system is there each time.  I don't know if it really helps when taking a single photo, but if you want a flash that can keep up, this one is great!  I like it so much, I'm planning on buying one or two more for my next shoot, to run in slave mode with this one.

I'm new to the digital SLR world. I had been using the built in flash on my Rebel XT. The built-in flash had done alright, but was nothing to write home about. Since I had spent most of my money on the camera, I needed a flash that was both affordable and would get the job done. This flash met both requirements. IF you are an advance user, you will want a higher end flash because the flash has limited adjuastable features. Yet, if you a newbie like me, this flash is GREAT! It has improved my picture quality dramaticly.

This lens has gotten some bad reviews, I think, partly because it is starting to show it's age.  This was the first USM IS lens, and the technology has REALLY grown since then.  If Canon were to come along with an updated 75-300 USM IS lens, man, it would blow everything away.  

That being said, yes, this lens IS a little slow to focus.  But, if you are not using it for work like one of the professional sports photographers you see on the sidelines at baseball games, you should be okay.  It also could use an extra stop (or two, or three!) because when you are handholding, you need that aperture to be as open as it can be. 

All of this aside, I really have gotten some gems of pictures out of this lens.  It lets you get as closer then you possibly could hope for.  If you have asteady hand and plently of availible light, you can get some really nice shots.  If you are in a low light situation... you will need a tripod.  The IS of lens works... pretty good, but I have had a number of ever so slightly blurry pictures that wouldn't have been had there been some more aperature room to play with. 

All in all, its a good starter telephoto lens, especially for digital SLRS since it really extends the zoom on those.  Its great for the price, and when you decide to upgrade to one of those white canon L beauties, just sell it

I cannot help but giggle when I saw comments like "great lens for the money". It is selling for $440 at here, even on so-called clearance. However, one can easily find the same lens at least $50 cheaper at some decent online camera store, such as B&H, ritz camera, etc. Sad Amazon..

The lens fulfilled all of our expectations as to quality of portraits and field of view flexibility.
The stabilization aspect is a great help, although it doesn't compensate for someone pushing the shutter too fast in low light conditions.
Highly recommend this lens as the standard use lens for the Canon Rebel XT

I am 67 years old and started out in photography as a kid with a contact printer and a box camera. I have had all types of cameras over the years, mostly 35mm film Canon slr's. I too bought all sorts of these 5-7 MP point and shoot digital cameras before returning to my true love, SLR's. I have had my digital Canon Rebel XT about a month now and I can't keep my hands off of it. It lacks nothing. Although the kit lense is good, I bought a 28-135 Canon zoom lense with image stabilizion and have produced stunning photo's with it. I love the way you can use the 7 points to focus, I mainly use only the center point with focus lock and never get an out of focus picture. I guess the nicest thing for me is that I now don't have the urge to buy every point and shoot camera that is paraded out on QVC or HSN that has a "wonderful" new feature like "low light or non-shake." This Canon has every good feature in the known universe and you can't outgrow it. Its a camera that will let you be as good as you can be, it won't hold you back. The battery life is great, the built in flash is good but I bought a 430EX and that's even better. I never figure I'm wasting money buying accessories for this camera as it will be my main squeeze for many years to come. I always missed my 35mm Canon slr's and now feel that I have an old friend back again, only much much better. Believe me, you can't go wrong getting this camea, its beyond description...

When digital cameras first came out, I, like many people swore I'd always be loyal to film. Digital could never take the place of film. I'm not convinced that it has replaced film completely. There's still something I love about putting a roll of film in the camera, shooting away, sending the film to be processed, and seeing the results. I also know it's a bit expensive. I know that the argument about quality has always been paramount in the discussion, but digital cameras are improving in this regard, and most manufacturers are assuring users that while the technology will always be improving, we are at a point where a good investment can be made in a digital SLR and it will not be outdated as soon as the buyer purchases the camera. So I figured now is the time to get a digital SLR. 

I have been a loyal Nikon user for nearly ten years, and have owned the Nikon N60, N70, and N80. My first love was, and still is the N70 (I've been told by the person who sold me the camera he thought I was the only person who loved the N70).  I purchased the N80 only after my N70 cost too much to repair, but I've enjoyed the way my various Nikon cameras have handled all sorts of situations and the fact that they can be as simple to use as a point and shoot if I don't have the time to use specific controls, but it also has options for more creative and artistic purposes. My Nikon cameras have allowed me to capture family moments with ease and majestic landscapes, wildlife shots and all sorts of other things I can't resist to capture forever.

I decided to purchase the D70 since it was close to what I've already experienced with Nikon. In many ways it works in a similar way to the N70 and 80, except it's a digital rather than film version. Like the film versions of the midrange Nikon SLR's, it has a dial that allows an automatic setting,  portrait, landscape, sports, close-up, nightscape, and night portrait modes, the ability to select aperture, shutter speed or manual controls. The camera has auto and manual focus abilities. Photos can be as easy or technical as the photographer desires. The controls are easy to use, though it takes practice to be comfortable. On a personal level, the camera has passed the Halloween test, niece's birthday test, and fall foliage in New England test and favorite scenic spots test. The only real difficulty I've had with the camera is trying to capture stained glass windows in a dark setting. Auto focus has not worked at all and I'm not thrilled with the manual focus of these shots, but at this point I'm sure it's the photographer and not the camera.

I do have one suggestion for anyone who purchases this camera. The manual is very confusing. It uses all sorts of symbols and can be more of a distraction than anything else. I've had luck with the "Magic Lantern Guides" with my other cameras, but have not as of yet used it for this camera. I did purchase the NIKON D70 FIELD GUIDE (David Busch, Wiley Publishing) which has been helpful. It can be a quick reference for anyone already familiar with Nikon and photography in general but it also provides and introduction for the novice to photography.

Some thoughts about using manual focus lenses on the Nikon D70s

I have owned this camera for about two months now and have taken about 100 photographs (keepers) to date.  Because I have been involved in photography for almost 35 years, I have developed certain prejudices. In particular, I have never been comfortable with auto exposure and even less comfortable with auto focus. In fact, the last auto focus camera I owned was a Nikon N8008s that I ultimately sold at auction because I could not adapt to using the various auto settings.

However, I like this camera. Why? The D70s is a very easy camera to use and I have only had to refer to the manual to check on a couple of settings and look up some features. Honestly, set up takes only a few minutes and handling is not terribly different from a film camera. I should point out that this camera is really designed for auto focus lenses and if you choose to use your manual focus lot, you will disable many of the camera's features.
 
Because I am both stubborn and cheap (but mostly only when it comes to spending money on myself) I am using my manual focus lenses on this camera. It is true that I do not get any internal exposure meter readings and must rely on a handheld Gossen or the sunny 16 rule (quite effective, really) for exposure determination. The LCD preview screen thus is critical for determining or adjusting exposure. I should also point out that the depth of field preview feature is also lost when using manual focus lenses. I was stunned when I could not stop my lens down and burrowed through the manual to find out what I was doing wrong--which was nothing except that I was using the wrong type of lens. While I really miss this feature, I am not sure how big a loss it really is because of the viewfinder. Others have made mention of the low magnification and tunnel like views through the finder and I can attest to this fact. I compared finder views to my trusty old FM and was just stunned by how poorly the D70 compared.  

Ultimately the best camera is the camera you use and the D70 has become my camera of choice. Even though I am using this camera like a vintage M series Leica--i.e., handheld meter and presetting exposure in anticipation of a photograph--I find that I can live with this level of usability. At some point I will probably buy an auto focus lens (maybe the 35 f2) and make full use of the feature set.  But for now I content on using the camera the old fashioned way

Other than the months of waiting for Nikon to deliver them to Amazon for shipping, the battery itself in a good deal.  They work well, charge up easy and hold their charge nicely.  Priced well, they cost less than the same type battery than Canon or Sony.  I bought them for a D80 and the older En-EL3a would not fit.  Of course I had 10 of the older batteries for my D70s and was rather surprised when they didn't fit the D80.  Basically the same size and shape, but keyed differently.  I was also surprised to find the 3e WOULD fit in the D70s, meaning they are backward compatable.

This battery is backwards compatible with the D50, D70/70s, and is used in the D80 and D200.  So if you have any Nikon DSLR and want a second battery, you want to get this one so that when you upgrade your camera you can use the battery.

This battery has built-in circuitry that tells you the actual charge status of the battery, and it is accurate.  This is a big deal; *if you are using the D200 or D80* it lets you know when your really do need to switch batteries or charge up.  This is the first battery I've seen that is accurate in this regard.  Kudos to Nikon. (This feature does not work in the D50/70/70s but the battery otherwise works fine)

I switched from the Digital Rebel XT. Since I already had L-glass lenses, I didn't run into problems with the 5D "exposing" cheaper lenses. The 17-40mm really shines on the full sensor! The burst rate is simply astonishing. Missing flash doesn't bother me, heck it's a $3000 camera, I don't expect a built-in flash. I have the Speedlite 580EX, which of course is wonderful in itself. I also have the battery grip which I recommend, as well as the RS-80N3 cable release. Image quality is superb overall - the 5D REALLY shines in high ISO numbers - more so than even the 1D from what I've read. Even at 1600 there's hardly any noise. It allows you to take great, crisp photos in low light where other cameras would require a flash. 

The camera also is quite light while being very sturdy at the same time. The 3 fps might bother some, but I prefer the incredible burst numbers.

There are no professionals or would-be professional  photographers in our house.  Instead we are ametuers who love to get fun shots of our friends and family.  We're not particularly interested in birds, flowers, bugs, race cars, etc.  We want to catch our kids doing what they love best; football, basketball, swimming, band, golf...

My only advantage is that I am very experienced with Adobe Photoshop, which lets me creatively salvage some less-than-perfect shots.

This year our son is a high-school senior.  Instead of buying an expensive portrait package, we voted to spend the money on a Canon Digital Rebel XT kit (with lens).  We choose one extra zoom lense (the 75-300mm f4-5.6 III USM Telephoto) for up-close action sports shots.  We didn't chose the IS lens because it was out of our price range.

We are having great fun with this camera and lens.  We have already taken a variety of football game pictures using the 'basic' sports setting on the camera (burst mode at full zoom).  They are great - crisp and clear.  These have been taken in full sun.  We realize that we'll have to get a little more creative when we are taking pictures in lower light situations.  But I think we can do it.

I would recommend this lens for anyone who just wants to capture some fun shots.  They might not be professional quality, but they are just what we wanted

This monopod does a great job for my camera. You have the quick, easy-off, it attatches to your camera by a screw, and you can press the button on the side of the monopod and just slide your camera right off of it quickly. I wanted a nice, inexpensive monopod for my new zoom lense. I have a Canon 35mm, and I recently purchased a 75-300 zoom lense for it, and I needed a monopod to stabilize the shoot. If I knew then what I know now, I would buy it again. Nice product

I bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it, or have already bought it--it's size.  It is amazingly small, it's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera.  I take it with me everywhere,literally, it is so small that I am able to keep it in my pocket, and I don't have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable. There is also a small covering for the lens, so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched.
The picture quality surprised me, when I first saw this camera I saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good--but I was wrong!  The picture quality of this camera is outstanding (taking its' size and price into consideration).

However, I do have a few things to complain about...

First off, the battery.  This camera uses a lithium battery, I find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient; because what if you are on vacation, where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station--there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there.  Not only is it inconvenient, but also the battery life span is short.  The longest I've had it work was about 1 hour and 45 minutes.  This isn't uncommon in cameras, though, just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries, you should be fine.

Another problem I had with this camera was the zoom function.  Such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in...wrong!  Very wrong.  The zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet.  Even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little, resulting in a noisy start-up.

The flash is very weak.  Really dissapointing. If you are inside, you can't be any farther away then 10 feet in a lit room.

The last problem I found with this camera was the macro function.  The auto-focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject.  To make matters work, there is no manual override to overcome this problem.  The focus is great, though, if you are not taking a macro shot.

These are all the flaws I found in the camera, it's not my first choice in cameras, I have come across many other beginner cameras that I prefer over this camera, but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size.  If you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times, then this is a great camera choice.

Pros:
- Reduces flare and ghosting when shooting in bright light.
- Helps protect your lens from dirt and scratches.
- Somewhat protects the lens in case of a fall.  Better to break the hood than the front element.
- Makes you look more like you know what you are doing and helps keep others from carelessly walking in front of you.

Cons:
- Will increase lens movement in windy situations, kind of like a sail on a boat.
- Takes up more room in your bag, even when reversed they still add to the diameter of the lens.
- People take more notice of you, will help to blow your cover if you are trying to keep a low profile

I received my 28-200 yesterday from Amazon.  Having read the customer reviews, I immediately put my Rebel XT on a tripod and ran two series of comparison shots with the 28-200 and my Canon 28-135 IS.  Three shots each at f-stops 5.6, 11, and 20, one set indoors at ISO 1600 and the other outdoors at ISO 200.  Focal length 135 using the same scenes with each camera, highest jpeg setting. After shooting both series, I compared them fresh out of the camera, side by side.  Results:  the 28-200 was at least as sharp as the 28-135 in both foreground and background in most instances.  It was visibly sharper at ISO 200 with f-stops 5.6 and 20, (the 28-135 took the honors at f-stop 10), and at 20, it was visibly sharper in both the foreground and the background.  The 28-135 was one-stop faster shutterwise.  Both lenses produced pictures which would sharpen nicely in Photoshop.  There are the vagaries of autofocus and different shooting conditions to consider; different test scenes conceivably produce different results.  My conservative conclusion:  the 28-200 is as good as it gets for a super-zoom on your Canon (unless you are going to drop $2200 on the L Series 28-300 IS and carry it), and the 28-135 IS has no clear sharpness advantage.  Between these lenses, its a tradeoff---an extra 65 mm of focal length (105 mm after a 1.6 conversion) versus image stabilization and low-light shooting capability. Both lenses focus quickly and silently, and both lenses produce usable shots.

I've bought several lenses from Adorama, two of which include a new 300/2.8 IS and the other, this 500/4 IS. All of their deliveries were prompt and well packed. I have zero complaints with them. I dealt the John (Green, I think is his last name) via email. I highly recommend them.

As for this lens, it is incredible. Wide open it creates a wickedly sharp subject against a wonderfully soft background (good bokeh). AF is very fast. This lens is extremely good and will still AF when used with the 1.4x converter. (AF works up to f5.6.

I love the new digital Canon. The only problem is it's not nearly as tough as it's film twin.  I had the camera less than a month when the pop-up flash quit working.  The Canon people have been great, and very helpful, but I'd rather not have had to send a brand new camera back to the factory.  The photos, however, are wonderful.  Film quality for the most part - printable and enlargable.  (It would probably be better to use the camera with a tripod when using the 300mm telephoto but I hike with it, so just remember to steady it before taking wildlife photos.

When I bought this camera the sales people tried to get me to buy another battery.  They said the one that came with it would only be good for about 20 minutes.  Now I have bought alot of items in my lifetime, a 20 min battery on a camera just doesnt seem like a very good "business" choice.  So I said no.  So I got the camera, charged the battery until the light went green (which sucked because I wanted to play with it right when i got it) and started taking pictures (oh I also got a 2G CF) worked great....so I planned to go up a mountain and take soem scenery shots.  Keeping in mind what the sales person had told me I pocketed the charger just incase.  Well, 6000', 300 pictures, and 5 hours later the camera is still running strong, still have 200 shots left for the trip home, battery life indicator hasnt budged off of the full button.  So all in all, I think the battery life is great, now i can see if your taking say thousands of pictures all in a row you may need another but for just going on a trip and shooting a few pictures at every stop point, the original will work fine.  as for the quality of photos.....i love them

I was able to scout out the different case options for my Sony DSC-N1. After much review, I asked my wife for her opinion and she picked the LCS-NB. It holds the camera nice and snug but you could work in a memory stick or battery. So far, so good

It's a pretty convinient bag.I put a Canon rebel XT with a Tamron 28-75 lens,a Canon 70-300 lens and a external flash inside and I still have the small pocket for wallet,keys etc.
The only drawback of this bag is,you can not put in big lenses.The Canon 70-300 is the limit.But if you only have a limited gear collection,you need to give it a try

It was everything it advertised as being.  I can carry my digital camera and lenses as well as two point and shoot digital cameras.  Being a slingshot backpack, my back doesn't moan and groan as it did with other camera bags.  I like the feature of swinging the bag to the front and to get my cameras with out removing the backpack

I have had this bag for a year and recommend it.  I use it all the time.  It's a great walkaround bag.  The first time you're in a place where you want to get to your camera quickly or don't want to put your bag down you'll appreciate the sling design.  Just be aware for a long mountain hike you may feel the weight on your shoulder after some time.

My only error was getting the 100 - I should have gone with the 200, and plan to do so.  I like to keep my lens hood in place which requires a little more room.  I'd also found that I need a little more room for non-camera things.

A word on the all-weather cover - a great feature.  A few weeks ago I was in Bermuda and walked to a beach about 25 minutes away.  Just as I arrived a soaking rain began that didn't let up for the entire walk back.  If I hadn't been able to pull on the cover my equipment would have been soaked.  Now I wouldn't buy a bag without one

I just got back from vacation. I have a bad back, and it was sore. I was very happy to discover that the way this bag hangs, I could carry my Nikon D-70 and one or two extra lens very comfortably. 

Gear is super easy to access and the bag provides a nice platform for changing lenses.

I have other bags which heft lots of gear, and they're great for travel days and the occasional big shoot, but if you're looking to hike (and have a separate way to carry a tripod), then this is a wonderful bag

Got the Lowero SlingShot 100 about 2 months ago, and it is really coming in handy.  In the main area, it holds my pentax digital slr with one lens mounted, 1 rather small lens and 1 decently big zoom lens (80-320mm), plus a Sigma EF-500 Super flash.  It's packed in there, and the flash just barely fits, but i don't need much more room.  The top compartment holds extra batteries, recharger, etc.  Really easy to access the main pocket when it is on my back...just by pulling the case to my front (no need to take it off my back).  Well made.  Zippers are strong so I don't have to worry about one loosening and my equipment falling out.  Perfect for the amateur to semi-pro photographer.

I use it with my Nikon D70, and am very satisfied with it.
I most often use it for long exposures, for taking picture that include myself, and for taking pictures of my 6-month old daughter, who stops acting naturally when she notices I hold the camera, so I place it on the tripod, and take pictures of her.

If you are shooting with a compact chip camera like the 20D or rebel xt, you will be happier with the 8mm fisheye.  This 15mm fisheye will just be a really distorted wide angle lens due to the 1.6 factor.  If you love the fish eye style and have that camera, you'll need something WIDER to compensate for your smaller chip.

I was disapointed with this lens for that reason.  The Sigma 8mm is great.  A note to the reviewer below.  Sigma makes some good lenses and bad ones.  This is a good one and you probably got a bad copy.  It happens often enough with sigma gear.  With this lens, its good to go and try one at your local camera shop and make sure it has the style you want.  Bring YOUR camera with a chip in it and take a few shots and go home to check them out.  Decide if you like the style and if that piece of glass is a good copy.

I got a good copy and was still disapointed because of my lack of knowledge.  Sounds like you got a bad one

I have not actually taken this underwater yet, but it appears to be well made and of similar quality to other cases. It keeps the
over-all size of the camera/case down to a size that could fit into a BC pocket. On the downside, it does have only limited functionality of the camera through the available buttons. You can zoom and telephoto, change from camera,playback and to movie mode and shoot the picture. You cannot do any of the setup functions while it is in the case. Regarding a stobe, Sony makes one that looks a little cheezy. There is a "universal" strobe by Sea Life (SL 960D) that fits, but the fiber-optic trigger is just taped onto the flash of the camera. I'm waiting to how this works. One replacement O-ring comes with the case-replacements from sony were outrageously expensive. Color-correcting (red) lenses are about $100 from sony, but not needed if you use a strobe. (unless maybe to shoot movies?)

I started with a D50 and have loved it from the very begining. I felt ready to step up to the next level, but didn't think I was ready for the d200. When I heard about the d80, I read everything I could. The biggest selling point was the fact that it was the same internal workings as the d200 in the more consumer friendly d50 body. I don't use all of the mode setting and find myself in Shutter and Aperture Priority most of the time, but it's nice to have the others there when I don't want to think about or have time to fiddle with settings.

The in camera image enhancements are amazing--but a word of caution. Vivid +2 will definitely give you vivid shots--if not too much so.

I've had this baby for about 2 weeks and imagine it will be my camera for the next couple years.

Compared to the Canon 30d (which I was thinking about) or even the new 400d (I haven't actually held one yet), this is the Nikon to have.

On batter life, I had a recent shoot where I took over 800 shots in a 3 hour period. The battery was at about half and that's with quite a bit of LCD viewing.

At this level both Canon and Nikon offer great equipment--you can't go wrong with either. Just get one of each in your hands, snap a few shots, and go with the one that feels the best for you

After way too much time infront of a PC reading reviews or a camera store counter (damn I was sick of it), this D80 is what I chose. Bought it 2 weeks ago and then went on a 10 day trip West. After draging it everywhere I has not let me down. For the price its perfect. I'm still working out exactly how to make it work to its potential aswell as fighting understanding of other manufacturers camera layouts in my head) At work I have a Rebel Xt I bought last year as I need its compact casing. My Brother has the Canon D30 after he progressed from the XT and a friend on the west coast has the D200. Having experience both I still love what I chose. My biggest reason however for going again with Nikon was that I already have a N6006 film camera with a lens and my hope was I could use its Nikkor AF 35-105mm with this camera and give myself more options. After reading lots of reviews as to whether this was possible and finally taking the lens to a shop I found it worked fine. Experience in the field in the last 10 days has shown it does not work seemlessly buy that may well be me not the lens. The 2.5 inch LCD is sooo much easier to read than the Rebel XT. The info read out on top is much better placed than the one above the LCD on the XT (if obstructed in an architectural model shoot and I can't see through the viewfinder myself, I certainly can't see the info screen if its below it). I didn't go with the 18-135 in the end for a lens as there is a vinyetting issue at the high end which bothered me. I got a great deal for the same price at Cameraland in New Hampshire for the D80 and the  (D70s) 18-70mm tried and trusted lens. Fab. Now need to save up and wait for the release of the  80-300 VR lens thats coming out. Would love the 80-400 Vr but its 3 times the price.
My hardest time was finiding someone with it in stock, at a price I wanted to pay, the set up I wanted and who wasn't trying to make a dodgie deal (like some of those cheap web based places in NYC).It really was the hardest part of the purchase in the end. I was surprised. Many people were almost reluctant to make a sale. It was wierd. Parts are hard to get too apparently like a spare battery and very few places have the 18-135 lens instock either.    
Anyway enjoy your purchase if you choose this camera. I hope it takes many great pictures for you.

First of all I do not consider myself anything more than a very beginning photographer !!! So I will not go into anything technical.  I will leave that to people who know more than I do. But what I am is an international traveler.  I simply got tired of coming home from fantastic trips with "snapshots".  I wanted someting much better, and boy did I get it with this camera.  I looked at the D70s and since I have very small hands, I could never feel comfortable holding it.  This camera is smaller without being small.  I have only taken photos locally, but at this time of the year with the leaves changing it makes a good start.  The built in editing features (filters etc.) are wonderful to work with.  I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who wants something more than "point and shoot" snap shots

I am by no means a pro at taking pictures, but this camera makes me look close to it. So far I have just used it as a point and shoot and the pictures have been of really good quality. I am tring to learn more of the functions and one I have run across so far that I enjoy is you can choose in certain functions for your photo to be black and white, color, or sepia. I am not high tech but I can use this camera pretty easily. My first digital camera was a canon digital elf with only 3.2 mega pixels and there is a huge difference in the quality of the pictures when you compare. So if you can affored to spend more for more mega pixels do it. The only down sides I have seen so far is it doesn't come w/ a great memory card which most do not and I imagine if I did not have small hands that the camera would be a little awkward to handle. It has lots of buttons and dials so you have to hold just right so that you don't hit any. But overal I am very satisfied w/ my purchase and hope to become a better photographer with the help of this camera. Canon cameras have served my family and I very well over the years

I am certainly happy I bought this filter kit. For a starting photographer, the price was right, and I have not noticed any quality issues. The UV filter stays on a lens at all times, as it's cheaper to replace the filter, than it is to have a scratched lens element repaired. 

The light polarizer is very handy, and also works very well, cutting down greatly on glare.

I have not yet had the occasion to use the warming filter yet. 

The filter case is a nice extra, it fits right in my camera bag, and is out of the way untill I need it

This is one of the best bargains that i've seen, "essentially" you get 3 filters for the price of one.  The image quality with these filters is great, the 812 (warming) filter is by far a favorite giving back the color richness that flash photography so often washes out, that is unless you have the patience for constantly tweaking your flash power.  Aside from the 812 the UV protector is basically a clear protective filter.  While it obviously has advantages over clear glass, I tend not to think of it as any different.  This too is a great filter which I use about half the time because it doesn't affect color hues or change f stop values too greatly while it takes the worry out of carrying the camera around ready for any candid shots that may occur.  Finally included is the circular polarizer. This filter adjusts the amount of uv light entering the camera by spinning the filter to the direction the uv rays are entering (or turning the thingy till things look better). This lens is great for sunny days and will take surface glare off lakes and glass making them transparent again.  It also makes colors more crisp in general when photographing buildings and other large "reflective" man-made things. So things sound great so far, but now to why I only give this item 4 stars.  While Tiffen is known to be one of the best at photo and video filters, they have quality control issues that do no live up to thier reputation.  In my case the 812 filter arrived with a discoloration in the glass.  While it was didn't hurt image quality, with the flaw being towards the edge of the filter, I none the less didn't want to find a situation in which the flaw would diminish quality.  Seeing as it was not amazon's fault my first e-mail went to Tiffen for a replacement which they said they would gladly do, but only after I send them the filter and they recieve it would they ship my replacement (not an option in my circumstances).  Instead Amazon's wonderful customer service shown through again, and within 3 days they had replaced the entire set.  The second set arrivided without flaw but since my other two filters were in perfect condition I traded just the 812.  I havn't had any other issues and i'm very satisfied with my filters. The only other word of warning would be to that of the circular polorizer. While I recieved 2 that were flawless occassionally I have read in reviews customers have received ones that were assembled backwards making the lens useless. A quick way to check to see if your CP is working correctly is to hold it, thread facing yourself, and look at an LCD monitor or TV and spin it until the picture dissapears(obviously working correctly). I still wouldn't pass up this deal knowing what I do now, chances are everything will show up perfectly but none the less if you're concerned order it before you need it and check everything over carefully. Amazon is always the best for returns and will often ship a replacement the next day with overnight shipping

Well, I've had my Rebel Xti for about 6weeks now, and all i can say is wow!!! I did have the Rebel Xt, which was an awesome camera.  I'm not a professional, but i do take pictures of what ever it may be outside or inside, youth or adult events as a hobby.  This camera is not for the person who wants to just point and shoot or to have a camera to stuff in your pocket.  This camera is for the creative person who wants control of the pictures they are taking.  The sensor cleaner and wide LCD are just a few of the wonderful advances from the XT to the XTI. The camera for me is easy to use and takes great pictures in auto mode or in my mode. 
I hope this helps you in your decision whether to buy or not.

I searched and researched the lens to purchase with my Canon Rebel XTI for weeks because I knew that I did not want the kit lens. I also did not have the money to spend on a 5, 6, or $700 dollar lens. In the end after reading countless reviews, ones implementing professional techniques and ones using just opinion, this lens looked to be the best value. For the money I really don't think that you can beat this lens. It focuses quickly, it is really quiet while doing it, and it is sharp enough for the money. Plus it has full time manual focus, which is a really big plus for a lens in this price range. The only problem is it is a little on the narrow side with the 1.6 crop factor on the Rebel XTI, but I would much rather have to deal with that than a sub-par image. In summary I would recommend this lens in place of the kit lens to anyone who doesn't have the money to buy an "L" series lens. It is really a great value

Every picture of mine that included larger portions of the sky would have these stubborn spores on it. Pretty infuriating, especially when you got the shot just like you wanted it. Yes, you can always remove those on Photoshop (or cheaper yet, The Gimp); but isn't it cool when you look at a picture and say: "that is it, nothing to do on it!" ??

And it wasn't just the sky. Any off-white but light plain colored background would suffer visibly from the acursed specks.

With this blower, greatly priced (pity that Adorama doesn't have free shipping though), I put my camera on the tripod, pointed it down, squirted three or four times - and gone are the specs!!!

Great buy for DSLR owners

I just bought a digital rebel about a month ago.  Love the camera, my old 380EX speedlight integrates with the camera but just doesn't offer enough cycle speed to keep up with continuous mode on the Rebel. This flash does the job for the Rebel and the plug for the external battery pack promises even better performance once I grab that item.  Another big selling point that really makes this unit worth the cash, is that it has its own infrared focus assist lamp which the digital Rebel lacks.  When this flash is mounted on your digital rebel, you don't get that annoying set of quick flashes that the camera has to set off to focus in low light when using the built-in flash.  The Rebel body uses the infrared focus assist on the 550EX to focus the lens; this feature alone is worth the big bucks this baby costs.  The flash has tons of features that most of us might never use, but as a advanced amateur I'm glad they're there so I can play with that if I should choose to try out some fancy stuff.  The wireless slave capability is handy but you've got to have at least one more 420EX, 550EX or 580EX to use that. I like the digital readout on the back of the flash and also the two way bounce head, it's important to note that you have to press a button to make the head turn either side to side or up/down---this should make the head sturdier than I've seen on some units that get loose after awhile and drive you nuts. This unit is a HONKER--really big, and, no lightweight either.  Get yourself a big deep camera bag if you want to lug this thing around with you.  What's the difference between this and the 580EX? The 580 has very slightly faster cycle times and offers some fancy new automatic flash exposure bracketing modes, for me anyway it wasn't worth almost two hundred dollars more for the 580. All of the newer EOS camera bodies are fully supported by this unit, it also works on older EOS bodies but there are functions available on the newer ones that aren't there on older stuff.  I like this flash it covers well, cycles fast and the controls are fairly intuitive and easy to use.  When you get yours don't lose that book, Canon doesn't seem to have them online anywhere I can find and I've seen places that want to charge you 18 bucks for a new one

This is one fantastic flash.  I had it on my Canon A2e for four years, and was ambivilent, but if you match this lens with one of Canon's newer bodies that has the funcionality to access all of the 550EX's features, you have an awesome, powerful, flexable flash that can change the way you shoot

Im a graphic design student in college, so i really needed a camera. I decided on this one and i am really glad i did. The pictures are nice and clean. The camera itslef is a very sleek looking one and is very compact. The only downfall to this is that it eats batteries pretty quick, but i just took them out when i wasnt using them. Buy this camera

This isn't a full review but some thoughts I've had after using it for a long time.
Stabilization- The fact is that if this is the camera you take everywhere with you, you are going to either lose shots or have to use the flash. If flash doesn't bother you, no sweat. But I've never like the look of it.
Ease-of-use- Great.
Voice memo- I use this feature all the time. It would be nice if it had a pause button because without it I end up with many small files.
Ex- This is where you set the exposure. Casio does a great job putting everything in one place. The only thing they should have done better is that if you have changed a selection (e.g. ISO 200 to 400) and hit the shutter release it should take the shot. Instead nothing happens. You have to click set first. It's an extra step that you have to make during a critical time

After checking prices with all the usual pricing bots, I found a better price, including free shipping, by going directly to Amazon. This lowest price did not appear in the other searches, so it pays to go to Amazon first.

I replaced my Canon SD400 with the Casio and find the controls more logical to use. This is important if you don't use the camera for a while, because you can just pick it up and start shooting without hunting for the manual. Also, the docking base is much more convenient than plugging small cables into the camera. You do not have to remove the battery in the Casio to charge it as you do with the Canon SD400. The VGA movie quality is superior on the Casio. Still pictures appear to be about equal. 

Amazon delivered by UPS in record time even with a weekend inbetween. I ordered on a Friday and received it the following Tuesday. Go with Amazon!

This was one of the first lenses that I purchased with my Rebel XT.  Now after taking several thousand pictures with it I can honestly say it was well worth the cost.  I very rarely have any unsharp pictures with this lens unless it is my own fault by trying to use too slow of a shutter speed without a tripod.

I also have the 180mm f/3.5L Macro Lens, which costs about 3 times more than this lens, and although it is very clear and the extra reach is nice at times especially since it can be used with both the 1.4X and 2X TC's, it is very difficult to use inside without a tripod.  The 60mm can be handheld if needed with very good results even if you have to bump your ISO up a little to do so.

I have also used this lens for both inside and outside portrait work with very nice results.

All-in-all, given it's small size and light weight I very rarely leave this lens behind when I go out because you never know when you might see a great macro shot

For its time and price (at the time), a fantastic camera.  6.3 MP is more than sufficient for most amateur and semi-pro (non-studio) work, and this camera works very well with what really matters:  Canon's fantastic lenses.  Battery life on this camera is very good.  The "shutter lag" (between when you depress the button and when the camera actually takes a photo) is fairly well non-existent, and the only real lag I have is when I am shooting multiple photos in RAW format.  As most photographers know, the lens is almost more important than the body, and outside of Leica lenses, I don't think anything really competes with Canon's line.  The 18-55 lens that comes with this camera is sufficient for casual work...I used it at the beach, and on hikes with my dog, when I don't want to lug around my bigger, more expensive, higher-quality lenses.  But for $75 or so, you can have a 50mm 1.8 EOS lens, which will supplement the 18-55 nicely, particularly for night photography.

My one complaint about this camera is its ability to meter light adequately in dark settings.  When I shoot RAW this isn't such a big problem, because I can fix it in Photoshop, but most everything I shoot inside, unless I manually mess with the white balance every time, has an orange tint that is interesting for the first 200 shots, and then is annoying after.  I think the more advanced EOS models that have come out since 2004 or so fix this color problem, and also help a bit with the lag between the RAW shots...but for the money, this camera is excellent, and far, far superior to, for example, Olympus' digital exquivalent (for a similar price).  The difference, as far as I'm concerned, is in the absolute advantage Canon has in lens quality.  You can use a high-end consumer body like this one, use a professional piece of Canon glass (lens) and take excellent photos.  I wouldn't invest in a system that doesn't also boast excellent lens quality

There are already tons of reviews on the EOS 300d (Digital Rebel) but I do want to share my experience with the camera, so I will keep this short. I bought this camera about 5 months ago and I am in love with. I was not new to photography or to SLR's, but new to the world of digital SLR. I had previously used an ancient Minolta x-570, a "pro-sumer" 35mm film slr with a Vivitar 35-105 standard zoom lens. First and foremost this camera takes excellent pictures, very high quality and no distortion that I have seen. This camera is particularly good as a beginner's dSLR because there are so many options to use and learn. But until you are ready to take advantage of all the featues, you can use this just like a point and shoot. Battery life has been excellent so far: thought I would suggest getting an extra to have as  a backup for long days of taking photos.  I have also been quite happy with the kit lens, which I wasn't sure I would like since it is not as versatile as the lens I had been using on my Minolta. But the kit lens has proved to be a great learning tool: I have been able to take some great shots, while also learning what kinds of other, better lenses I would like to add to my setup.
 
**The only issue I have had was a problem with a Sandisk 2gb CF card. After about 300 shots, the camera froze and stopped responding to that card. I was able to salvage most of the photos after the fact, but don't risk it. If you're serious enough to spend this kind of money on a camera, spend a little extra money on the Sandisk Ultra II line of high-speed cards.

I took this with me recently to Australia and shot landscapes as well as others, and the pictures came out better than the film cameras I have used recently, plus you don't need a scanner.  This camera works great, a must have for semi-pros.  Pros, wait for the new 1D.  Pictures come out great at 11&quot;x17&quot;

This camera is amazing. Out of the 3 digital camera's under $150 I've used, this is by far the best, beating out the Kodak and the SiPix. I originally bought the SiPix, and it was junk. Don't buy the SiPix that's under $150. The Kodak for some reason didn't seem like it took as good pictures as the FinePix, but the software was a little better, being from Kodak. 

This camera can take pictures of resolution up to 2 megapixels, but I don't even use that option because the 1 megapixel pictures are so amazing. It comes with a 16MB removable memory card, so you can take around 49 pics at 1MP, around 24 at 2MP, and it takes short videos for about 30 seconds in mpeg format at a 320 x 160 resolution, or more on a lower setting. The LCD screen can easily be turned on or off to save battery power, and the 2 AA batteries it takes lasts pretty long. It has a nice, sleak design, and the software has no issues with windows XP at least. 

The only cons I could think of are that the only zoom it has is 2X digital zoom, which is pretty much useless, and I never use it, since it's the same thing as zooming in with your picture viewer on your computer. So you can consider it not having any zoom. The software for it works well, but it could be better, options wise. The filenames of the pictures will default to a number depending on its order on the memory card, so if you transfer pics to your computer more than once in a day (since it creates folders based on date), you'll have to rename each pic. But I hardly complain, since the pictures come out so incredibly well. 

I'm so happy with this camera! If you want a camera under $150, this is the one to get. Don't even waste your time with the Kodak, unless you want the one with 3X optical zoom, but that's $200. I use it for general purpose, taking pictures of freinds and such. Once in a while I take a picture of a sunset at 2MP, and that will be photo quality printed on a full page. 1MP creates crisp and clear desktop wallpaper size images, and .3MP will created good smaller images to put on websites. There's no reason to buy anything else, go with the Fuji FinePix A200!

I got this camera for my 17th birthday last summer, and it's great. As much as I'd love to have a Canon Powershot, it's a bit out of my price range. All the people who think that using the LCD screen runs out the batteries after &quot;2-4 pictures&quot; are lying to you. I bought rechargable batteries from radioshack, and I've taken up to 400 picture without the batteries needing to be changed. This is a good camera with good quality in good lighting. In dark or overcast situations, it can look a bit grainy, but that's easily photoshopped. I recommend that when uploading, plug it into the wall with a digital camera adapter, because uploading sucks all battery power right out. I recommend this for someone who hasn't owned a digital camera before, or for someone that wants good quality at a not-so-crazy price

I highly recommend the Raynox DCR 1540Pro Teleconverter for the Canon S2 instead of the Canon branded one.   Hoya makes a 67mm UV filter for this and both are available at Lensmate.com.   The Canon WC-DC58A wide angle converter however is really good.  Tiffen made a better one but it seems to not be available anymore.   
By the way, the function that the S2 provides for settings using the lens adaptors and teleconvertors are to adjust for the AutoFocus function of the camera and are necessary unless you wish to try to focus yourself using the manual focus which, in my mind, because of the LCD both in the screen as well as in the viewfinder with a lower resolution than an optical viewfinder, is iffy at best.   Trust the camera.....it really does an excellent job.   One final note, I would recommend using the Focus Bracketing option in lower light situations as the Auto Focus is weak in those situations.

This lens does exactly what it should. The overall quality is extremely good. Take a look at my photos:

- First photo is without the lens
- Second photo is with the lens and flash
- Third photo is with the lens and without flash

There are a few things to note about the photos:

- There is a substantial amount of barrel distortion. This is normal. Try not to have straight lines near the borders of the photo to make it less obvious.

- Fringing is exaggerated. You notice fringing (purple or blue tints) along high contrast edges of objects that are near the borders. You can see this on regular shots but is more exaggerated with the wide angle lens.

- The lens makes a shadow when using the built-in flash. You can see the shadow in the photo with the flash. In a darker environment, it is very obvious. The external flash is the only way to fix this.

A couple details:

- You can get an extender that is a nice brushed aluminum here:

http://www.lensmateonline.com/S2.html

- The camera has a setting (Converter) to indicate that you have the lens attached. It's not obvious what it does but it is indicated by a change in the image stabilization icon so I assume that it affects the way that image stabilization works.

Overall, I recommend this lens

I'm still learning to use this camera and all the features. So far it is amazing. I've been taking pictures of the kids and it looks like a pro did the shots. I use the auto mode a lot and it works great. The zoom is amazing. I love that it tells me when I am focused. Also it has great battery life. I'm very happy with this camera

When I had seen this camera on net, I had anticipated to be quite big but this one is really small & handy... Except for the LCD panel which is cumbersome to open always, its a great camera... The zoom is amazing and so is the image stabilization to go with it...

This tripod was a total shock! I was amazed at the quality, stability and portability. The heavy duty denier carrying case is a great bonus. The level and quick release were also a welcome surprise. This was the best $9.00 I ever spent for photography accessories.

The previous review is not completely correct. The problem is not with the product but with the description what amazon.com put up for the Canon CPM-E3 Battery Magazine. It is a battery magazine for the Canon Compact Battery Pack CP-E3 and not for the camera battery grip. I think the product itself is a great thing, it lets you switch the whole magazine with 8 preloaded batteries instead replacing the batteries in the Canon Compact Battery Pack CP-E3.
The previous reviewer should not judge a product by the incorrect infromation given by a retailer

Easy, fast and serius tool, for cleaning your optics.  The easy use is discribe in the manual that is very clear to understand.  Cleaning is fast with the Nikon lens pen, cuase it has the necesary to do the job well done, as any profesional tool.  Now I have 2 of them, for my two camera bags.

Great flash, all the good qualities of the SB800 but less of the data dump and decision quagmire! It has the built in flash disperser, its lighter than the 800, so unless you're into more info than you need, go with the SB600. Oh, it has a shorter recycle time too.

Canon has three digital cameras for $2,500+. The 1DS Mark II, the 1D Mark IIN and the relatively new 5D. I chose Canon over Nikon (which I've shot most of my photographic life) because of Canon's more impressive suite of lenses. Here's the decision process I went through. As with most products, it comes down to how you'll use it. All of them have tradeoffs.

1. Megapixels. More pixels - with a few caveats - translates into an image that can be enlarged (and cropped more tightly)with less deterioration. The 1DS is the market leader at 16.7MP, the 5D comes in at 12.7MP and the 1D at 8.2MP. If you're a commercial art or magazine photographer the 1DS probably makes sense. If you're a wedding photographer, the 5D is probably the sweet spot. In practice, however, the difference in pixels between these cameras will not make an appreciable difference for most people. At 8.2MP, you can make an 11x17 print at 200 pixels/inch without any enlargement beyond the camera's native resolution. Up to that size, you certainly won't see much difference in prints from the three cameras. That said, the higher megapixels of the other cameras gives you more extreme cropping lattitude. 

2. Full frame. The 1DS and 5D are full frame - that means the sensor in the camera will capture the view of the scene that you're accustomed to seeing with your 35 mm film camera. The 1D and most digital cameras have what is called a field of view crop factor (FOVCF). For the 1D, it's 1.3X. What that means is that both the viewfinder and the image sensor don't capture everying the lens is "seeing" - it crops the view in a little tighter. The result: your lenses are effectively 1.3X longer. A 70 mm lens becomes a 91 mm lens and so on. Because the camera is effectively "cropping" the edges of the image that the lens produces, it also tends to eliminate the softness or vignetting that appears at the edges of some lenses. Whatever camera you use, what you see in the viewfinder is still what you get, and it doesn't affect the pixel resolution of the image. My 300 mm lens with a 1.4X extender and a 1.3X FOVCF is effectively a 546 mm lens - getting into birding territory. (If you're switching from film to digital, some of your lenses may may no longer fit your needs with the FOCVF. Your 35 mm lens is no longer really a wide angle at 45 mm.)

3. Durability. This was most important to me, though it may not be for someone who doesn't shoot in extreme conditions or expects to replace their camera in two years. Both the 1Ds and 1D sport complete metal bodies, sealed against the weather with a shutter that will last at least 200,000 cycles. The 5D - a very solid camera - is designed for 100,000, is not weather sealed and has more plastic components.

4. Weight/size. What a solid, metal body giveth in durability it taketh away in weight. For those who prefer a camera with heft, these have it. For many people, this is a big drawback. The 1DS and 1D are 43 oz., or almost three pounds for just the body, without the big battery. Add the battery and you're at 54 oz. The 5D is just 29 oz. and 31 oz. with battery. The 1DS and 1D, with built-in vertical grips, are also more than 2 inches taller. If you're looking for something less obtrusive and easier to carry around, the 5D is it.

5. Speed. There's a reason the 1D is the camera of choice for photojournalists, sports and many bird photographers. It shoots at a smooth 8.5 frames per second, compared to 4 fps for the 1DS and 3 fps for the 5D. For most day-to-day uses, 3 fps is more than adequate. From using both, I'd say the 1D autofocuses a bit faster, too. The 1D has 45 autofocus points, compared to nine for the 5D.

6. Price. Give or take a hundred here or there, the 1DS is about $7,200; the 1D about $3,900; and the 5D about $3,000. Price will determine whether you get the 1DS or not. If you can afford it, go for it. Otherwise, other features - or the possiblity of buying more lenses instead of more camera - will make your decision.

What did I decide? First, I looked at how I'd use the camera: photojournalism, travel and wildlife photography. The higher FPS was not as important to me as durability and autofocus speed, so either the 1D or 1DS would do. In the end, I decided I'd rather spend the money on lenses that would not be obsolete with the next new and improved camera. (I bought the 300 f/2.8 IS for close to the difference in price.)

So, I went with the 1D Mark IIN. If my camera was generating some good cash flow or my wife didn't need a new car, I'd probably have gone with the 1DS. I'm VERY happing with the decision and the camera.

For most people and most uses - general portrait, landscape and travel photography - the 5D is probably the way to go. (Or perhaps the next greatest camera that Canon will announce later this year.

Yep, it extends the eyepiece out a little bit ... which helps those of us with noses not smudge the lcd display ... but it also distorts the view in an annoying way.

I bought the 250D lens to use with my Sony DSC-F717 and it is just wonderful. I can also use it with my Canon G3 because I bought a Canon LADC58B Conversion Lens Adapter (which is required and is inexpensive). 

I had been hearing a lot of good things about this lens in digital photography forums and I have seen many wonderful examples of its use. 

I recommend this lens to anyone who wants to make their "macro" photography shine. Get one! 

Just be clear that there is the 52mm and the 58mm and don't be confused as to which one will fit your camera.

Edit: 

Just a clarification: 

This one 'is' the "58mm" even though above (on this page) when you click the links "See More Technical Details" and "See all Product Description" it mentions "52mm". This is misleading and confusing. At the very very top of this page it says "58mm". Let me just assure you that this particular one 'is' the "58mm" and 'is not' the "52mm".

late edit (Aug 04, 06):
Well, it looks as if Amazon finally corrected that misleading info I mentioned just above in my clarification

This is just a plain sweetheart of a lens.  It covers the useful 18-35 mm range (which is 27-52mm on a Nikon digital SLR, which is a VERY useful range).  This lens costs less than half the price of the (expensive) professional Nikon 17-35, and does almost as nice a job. Sufficiently nice, in fact, that most amateurs will not discern much, if any, difference.   While not built like a tank, I think that the quality of construction on this one is excellent, and more than adequate for enthusiastic amateurs and even some pros.

On a Nikon digital SLR, which will use the center portion of this lens (due to the size of the sensor in the SLR) you can expect excellent, even spectacular results.  This is a fabulous lens for landscape and nature shots, portraits, or just plain walking around taking pictures.  Someone who only wanted one lens that was not a telephoto could do much worse than to select this excellent, versatile lens.  This one is great for parties, vacations, and the works.

The images I have shot with this lens have all featured superb contrast, are very sharp, and have beautiful color rendition.  There just is not a lot not to like about this lens. I give it 4 stars for overall performance, but 5 stars for value and price/performance.  Some lenses just get it all together and work and become keepers.  This is one of those

Well, besides a whole bucket full of money, one of them lets you take photos in lower light, okay, that's obvious. The 16-35mm is a bit heavier, but not so you'd notice, unless maybe you were carrying it around all day, without eating and you're a bit over the hill. So why pay the extra money, unless, of course, you do a lot of shooting in the early morning and late evening?

 Maybe you shouldn't, because I've been doing a lot of photo taking with both, film and digital, and as one would expect from the "L" lenses, the photos are crisp and sharp. In fact I keep I the 17-40 on the camera I carry around all day, you know, the one I might leave on the table in a restaurant when I got to the restroom. It's a lot less money to lose to someone looking for a five finger discount. However, my gal pal Sara and I take a lot of early morning photos. She shoots old houses, and she never, ever goes out without the 16-35mm. She swears by it, loves it, sometimes I think better than me.

So there is a difference, I'm the kind of person that could happily live with less expensive lense, Sara is not. However they both deliver gorgeous photos. You can't go wrong if the lense has that red circle around it.

I love the new digital Canon. The only problem is it's not nearly as tough as it's film twin.  I had the camera less than a month when the pop-up flash quit working.  The Canon people have been great, and very helpful, but I'd rather not have had to send a brand new camera back to the factory.  The photos, however, are wonderful.  Film quality for the most part - printable and enlargable.  (It would probably be better to use the camera with a tripod when using the 300mm telephoto but I hike with it, so just remember to steady it before taking wildlife photos.

When I bought this camera the sales people tried to get me to buy another battery.  They said the one that came with it would only be good for about 20 minutes.  Now I have bought alot of items in my lifetime, a 20 min battery on a camera just doesnt seem like a very good "business" choice.  So I said no.  So I got the camera, charged the battery until the light went green (which sucked because I wanted to play with it right when i got it) and started taking pictures (oh I also got a 2G CF) worked great....so I planned to go up a mountain and take soem scenery shots.  Keeping in mind what the sales person had told me I pocketed the charger just incase.  Well, 6000', 300 pictures, and 5 hours later the camera is still running strong, still have 200 shots left for the trip home, battery life indicator hasnt budged off of the full button.  So all in all, I think the battery life is great, now i can see if your taking say thousands of pictures all in a row you may need another but for just going on a trip and shooting a few pictures at every stop point, the original will work fine.  as for the quality of photos.....i love them

This is the first SLR camera that I have ever owned.  I bought it because I was going on a trip around the world, wanted a nice camera, and had it recommended by a camera shop owner.   It is extremely easy to use, so easy that I could hand the camera to someone in one of the countries I visited, point to the button they needed to push and I ended up with a great picture.  I didn't need to explain a thing.  I also didn't mind carrying it around all day, it is very light for its size.  

 I have owned the camera for four years now and it still takes beautiful pictures.  I have taken all sorts of pictures with this camera, from landscapes to action shots and they all turn out great.  The action shots are never blurry!  The only complaint that I have is that the autofocus does not work well in low lighting, sometimes it is slow and sometimes it won't work at all.  In these cases I just turn on the manual focus option.

All the options that the camera has are great, but to be honest I rarely use them.  I've found that it is often easier to use manual focus than to adjust the camera so it will autofocus off center.  If I know that I'm going to be taking action shots or landscapes I will set the camera to that mode, but often I forget and my pictures still look great.

I think that this is an excellent camera, especially for someone that is used to a point and shoot but wants the extra quality that a SLR camera can give them.  There are also many choices when it comes to additional lenses, so when the photography bug gets you, this camera can stay with you

The Canon RS-60E3 is all that Canon says it is....it is a simple one handed operation switch that can open the flash, focus, then release the shutter once, a multiple of times, or hold it open for bulb exposure.  Although the cord is not long enough to include the photographer in the picture, it was simple enough to make an "extension" that allows for very remote exposures

The fisheye lens is a lot of fun, and I enjoy using mine.  However, I find that the practicality of the lens is minimal.  I don't usually want my "serious" photographs to have fisheye distortion.

I don't tend to like the 1.6x crop on Canon's lower-end digital SLR cameras, but with the fisheye this has an interesting benefit:  it's reasonably easy to use the fisheye as a standard wide-angle lens, since most of the distortion is removed by the 1.6x crop.  You can still get distortion, but it's a lot easier to compose a shot without it using a 1.6x camera than a full-frame camera.

Either way, lots of fun.  Buy one for the enjoyment, or even for professional assignments if your work calls for it, but think about if you really want the distortion before getting one of these

Fits my Canon SD550 perfectly and no complains abt that. The quality of the product is pretty good. When used with the belt clip, its easy to open and easy to put the camera back.  Camera seems very secured when used with the belt clip.

Though the lenses for my Nikon D50 were not as expensive as some can be they still were several hundred dollars and having this UV Protection Filter protecting the lens glass made a whole lot of sense. I feel less stress when I clean the filter lens than if I was wiping dust and dirt from the actual lens glass. This size, 52mm, was what was specified for my D50 and it fits perfectly, as it should. I have no complaints at all with the manufacturer or the seller. If you are new to digital SLR's like I was then get this filter to protect your lens. And spend your time worrying about the sensor when you need to switch out your lens.

If you are looking for a great all around camera, this is it!  Our kids play sports and are in constant motion and the sports mode captures it all.  Also love the "Last 4" feature, gets some great action shots.  We had the Fuji 7000 before this and they have definately fixed the features that bugged me.  Love the new manual zoom (if you like 35mm lenses your like this) as well as the battery drain.  I used to have to replace batteries every day, now its more like once a week with the amount we use it.  My other favorite feature is the dual memory slots for those times where I forget to put it back in the camera after downloading!  So there is always one in there!.  The video comes out great and with the new manual lens you can zoom during video shots.  In general, without spending A LOT MORE, you get a great camera that keeps up with an active "picture happy" family

I, like many people, research high-tech purchases before buying because of the complexity of the items and the invariably high cost of some of the items.  Digital cameras are no exception.  I was looking for a replacement for my KonicaMinolta Dimage Z1.  My requirements were fairly straight forward:  the new camera had to have a 10x zoom, no less than a 5mp processing chip, and third, get my photography skills to the point that the camera after this new one could be a DSLR.  I have read the reviews here on Amazon regarding the performance of the S9000, and while some of them, I felt, were right on, others did not read the professional reviews before purchasing this camera.  The intended use of this camera has never been a point and shooter.  While the S9000 does possess automatic functions to "streamline" use, these features are whoafully inadequate for the overall optical and proccessing capibilities that Fuji strove for in it's design.  Let me for clarifications' sake say this loud and clear:  IF YOU WANT BREATHTAKINGLY BEAUTIFUL, CLEAR, VIBRANT PICTURES WITH PERFECT EXPOSURE USING THIS CAMERA, THEN YOU MUST USE THE MANUAL SETTINGS.  THIS IS NOT A POINT AND SHOOT TYPE OF A CAMERA!!!!!!  Out of the box the S9000 has been a Godsend.  Not only are the images super sharp with no hint of edge fall off that hampers other high res cameras, but the exposure is so perfect that I question my ability for luck.  The setups are very easy and the controls and functions are a snap.  The white balance and shutter speed settings are not easy concepts to grapple with in potography, and yet Fuji has made short work of them with their intuitive design.  There really are two photographic miracles at work in the S9000:  one, is the processor that captures detail and color that you feel guilty for paying so little for something that is better than much more expensive equipment, and two, is that the exposure is so good that if I did not know better, I would think that I was using an advanced film SLR.  This is an absolute rave for this product.  The fit and finish are superb, ergos are comfortable and controls easy to find and use, and it fulfilled my need for a camera that would get me ready for a DSLR but not be too complex.  The only downside to this camera is that it will take time to process the image before exposure, but outside of some DSLRs, this is a problem with all digital cameras.  It is true that this camera is big and heavy, but then photographic perfection ain't free.  Home Run FUJI!!

I will not repeat what other reviews have stated already, all the reviews below are pretty much correct with this camera being a high quality and easy to use etc etc.

The only issue is focusing on a small target such as a name brand logo inside a Rolex watch.  It is HARD even in Manual mode (and I actually have alot of digital camera experience).  Forget trying to focus in AUTO mode, it won't happen.. at least not without alot of tinkering and stress.  

If you need to take alot of close up pictures of small detailed items (jewelery, insects, etc.) then I recommend buying a digital SLR camera, Nikon D50 is a good one!  This Fuji you are looking at here is perfect for taking pictures of normal things like people, cars, buildings, sites, etc

 The black of this is the same as on my camera, and with all the parts together, this is one professional looking set up!
 I am not sure if this hood cuts down on glare/reflection, as I have not used it on a sunny day, but I don't see why it shouldn't.
 And as cheap as this little product is, it is pretty much a must have with this camera! (S3 IS)

 One last side note, should you alreay own a extra lens or two. And they happen to be metal, be VERY carful about screwing them into this plastic adaptor! I made that mistake and had to put the whole thing in the fridge for an hour, so the metal would shrink, and I could get the pieces apart

I bought this camera for my sister, as an early Christmas present, thinking I would need some time to set it up for her, well in less then 30 minutes I was ready, It's a awesome camera, I was impressed, of the ease from set up to formatting the 512 SD card. I have sent the site to another sister whom is interested. It is the easiest camera to use and has features that will impress anyone, Great photos from very close to far away. I would recommend this camera to anyone

Okay, first off, I'd like to say that this is my first AF SLR--I stepped up from my dinosaur of a camera, Canon AE-1 manual focus, and right now I am quite overwhelmed by all the features in this little thing.  I'm still in the learning stages of all this technology but let me tell you this, I am having fun!  It amazes me that Canon can offer quite an impressive camera for the price.  

I just received my first few rolls from the developer and the pictures came out amazing--so clear and the colors are very vibrant.  Just to let you know, I'm using the 28-105mm f/3.5-4.5 USM lens.  I took the suggestions of many and passed up on the "kit" lens and I'm sure glad I did so.  I would highly recommend the f/3.5-4.5 lens, but unfortunately for the rest of you, Amazon has discontinued it.  But you could order it from one of the many other photo shops (B&H, Adorama, etc). 

Do I have any regrets on this purchase?  Absolutely not!  I love this camera and even though I've owned it for less than a month, I'm actually thinking about stepping up to the EOS 3 and using this as a backpacking/hiking body.  Hmm...what to do, what to do?  Do I purchase another body or start a collection of L-series glass?  ...that is the question.

Seems a little much to pay for an "extension cord" but upon receipt I see it is of very high quality and nice build on the connectors. Plus, its a brand item from Canon, so what can you do

The other day I used a friend's standard digital camera for a little while. The whole time I found myself missing the manual zoom, instant response and convient manual buttons on my D50. This camera takes amazing pictures. As an dSLR beginner I used the camera in Auto mode for the first several weeks, now after reading some books on photography I'm slowing starting to use the manual features. The D50 lets me choose the level of control that I'm comfortable with, from full manual to full automatic; and both options are just a turn of the dial away.

The body of this camera is built like a tank. Metal and high quality plastics abound. The buttons provide good feedback and the switches feel solid and durable. It is a beautiful piece of precision engineering

Not much to add to the other positive reviews posted, other than I am another user that loves my D50. Have had it for a year now and shot over 10,000 photos with excellent results (mostly landscape and wildlife).  Excellent image quality and the hand grip fits perfectly to both my hand and my husbands.
The only CON I can think of at this time is that there is no backlight on the top panel - this makes it difficult to adjust settings in low/ no light situations. Also, for people that are used to the little compact point & shoot cameras this might seem a little overwhelming at first and bulky to carry around (which is why I have a little pocket camera for my purse). I also got the 18-200 lens and love it - perfect walk around lens

I needed a lens hood for my 50mm lens and paying $25 for a hood on a $75 lens might seem ridiculous. However, that might be because the $75 lens is so inexpensive. If the lens was $250 then paying an extra 10% might not seem too bad.  I just saw the total cost of the lens and hood for $100 and that's good for a terrific prime lens and its hood.  

However, please note: the lens hood is rather shallow (1 star reduction) and it is a screw-on two piece kit (1 star reduction). One piece is the adaptor that screws-on where the filters normally go (UV Filter) in front of the lens and is intended to be a permanent integral part of the lens and the second piece is the hood that snaps on and off this adaptor. The adaptor ring retains the same 52mm rim size so your protective filter can go before or after the adaptor.

(1 Bonus Star) Because $100 is still a bargain for a 50mm, f1.8, super fast, super sharp, super clear, light weight beginner lens and hood kit!

I hope this helps rather than confuse. :)

This kit is a must have for any of the compatible Canon cameras. Digital camera rule #1: ALWAYS carry a spare battery - the kit is almost worth it for  that alone. The leather case is great: stylish looks that provides a tough protective armor in case you drop the camera. The neck strap is quite strong and looks good too. It may not be everyone's cup of tea but I like it. It comes in handy when I need quick access to the camera and don't want to fumble through pockets or bags

Although this is a good batch of accessories, the camera case itself is a little unhandy at times.  It has no carry strap -- the camera strap sticks out through a slit in the top.  So, if you want to carry the case by a strap and you decide to take a picture, you must open the case, pull the camera's strap through the slit, then lift the camera out.  It would not keep me from buying this but it does make it unhandy

I have been working for a major daily newspaper in Baltimore for 2 decades. Perhaps that will qualify me as an expert in photography. I have been shooting digital imagery since the late 1990s. Maybe that qualifies me as an expert in digital photography. This may be long- winded, but it's extensive and can be useful. 
 
 I received the Nikon D2H camera -- 2 bodies total -- over one year ago. I think I got them shortly after the D2H system was released in 2003. Since then, I have used them to shoot images of all types -- documentary, sports, daytime, available light, flash, and dead- of- night -- for the paper I work for. This is the only camera I work with. 
 
 First, please read the manual. There is a ton of information there, and the information is terrific to begin with. The D2H is highly- configurable, with screen after screen that you can set for your own specific use (resist lending the camera to anyone for a long period of time, for your camera may be returned with many of your settings changed so much that it acts like a thoroughly different camera). 
 
 I'll just punch right in to the way it feels. The camera is a rather heavy beast, and for some, there can be an amount of shoulder or neck fatigue when using it for hours per day, like I do. But the camera feels well in hand and the controls are easy to move through. I've long since given up using any camera bag. All I have are a fanny pack for a 14mm, 55mm, teleconverters and 2 extra camera batteries and flashes clipped to its belt. And the D2H's hold the 17-35mm Nikon and the 80-200mm Nikon one- touch or the Sigma 120-300mm 2- touch. 
 
 Shooting is a breeze. The batteries let you shoot long before the need to recharge. I have my D2H set on ISO 200 or 400 most of the time and sacrifice shutter speed for lower ISO as often as I can, because the higher ISOs bring digital noise and a loss in color saturation. Just today, I purchased digital noise plug ins for Photoshop to limit this, and that's a wonderful thing to invest in with this camera when you must shoot action photography with no flash at ISO 800 and above. 
 
 I now have little problems with capturing images in even barely- limited lighting. I recently shot stars and a plane wing from my seat of an Airbus at 36,000 feet over the Pacific at 30 seconds wide open @ f/ 2.8, and it looks tons better than night shots via the D1H, which lacked the internal digital noise filter. That filter kicks in at around 1/2 second and longer exposures, and can make you wait as long as your image you've shot to strip your long exposure of much of the digital noise. When you shoot this way (and in general), don't simply react by cranking up ISO because you will not be happy with your results. 
 
 The camera can be loud. At over 7 frames per second, it can make you obvious in a quiet room. Shooting sensitive situations can be testy, so limit your shooting to single frames. I wish this camera had an option to silence this camera, but since the mirror has to raise and lower, there's no chance to do this. 
 
 Am I happy with the D2H? Definitely, yes. Are there improvements that can be made? Yes. But the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. People have been bailing out of using the Nikon system and going Canon, which has some incredible gear, I won't deny that. But instead of simply giving up on your system of equipment, learn how to use the D2H well and you'll be much happier than ever. And that means you should push its qualities to the max while respecting its limitations. 
 
 For instance, white balance. This can be the best thing for you, or the worst thing you've ever dealt with, depending upon how you approach it. Daylight, grey skies, dusk and dawn are easy, because you can set the camera to daylight, flash, shadow (for dusk and dawn times) and even the fluorescent and incandescent tend to be right in the ballpark. But the horrible mixed light or the street lamps that glow blue/green or orange- red from mercury vapor can be the death of an image if you don't properly use white balance. Preset white balance is king, here. I can get grey, black and white when I preset in mercury vapor light. And I used the preset for any light that the auto white balance setting can't figure. There is also a setting to dial in kelvin temps as well! If you do this (and I can go on for miles here), you're on your way. So, with trying this D2H, or considering it, read through some of the digital D2H forums and ignore the posts that slam the camera without giving instances. Generally, those who pan the camera have not tried to understand it. I can bang off images to disprove where they suggest this camera will fail. When you have decent light, you'll have a decent image. But when you try to use it without learning how you can maximize the system, you will come about shooting images that are terrible and unprintable. 
 
 In closing, I have not been paid by anyone, I have no Nikon stock and have no outside interest in writing this except that I'm giving the D2H credit where it's long overdue

Now that i have had this on my camera for a while now, my camera feels so weird with it off, i love the grip it gives and the extra battery life is great for those all day shooting events that i go to. I wish the buttons were the same plastic/chrome color as the ones on the camera but its a well built product and works fine so i cant complain

My 2 year old is really active and my point and shoot camera cannot keep up with him.  And I also don't like the washout look when I uses flash.  So I researched about which SLR will best meet my needs, mainly catching fast action, candid moments and low light photos without flash.  The Canon 30D comes up top on the list.  It has the best high ISO performance in its class (better than Nikon and Sony).  And when I combine the 30D with the fast zoom lens EF-S 17-55 mm f/2.8 IS, the result is amazing.  I can stop any action in daylight, capture every candid expression of my 2 yr old with the fast burst mode, and take indoor or night photos without using flash or tripod.  Portraits are also excellent with sharp image and beautifully blurred background (bokeh).  Even the dimly-lit decors of the Disneyland Haunted Mansion came out superb when we went there for the Halloween party at night, without flash or tripod.  This is really an important factor for me to buy this camera, as taking pictures with a tripod is not an option when your subject is an active 2 yr old.  But you will need a good lens to make this work well.  If you use a cheap kit lens, then it will probably not matter which camera you pick.  Remember that these 3 are all very good cameras and the small differences in image quality you see in reviews are apparent only when they use the best prime lens (not the kit lens)and crop the pictures to magnify the details.  The Sony is a very good choice if you are on a budget and don't need low light performance (use flash and save money).  The Nikon has more custom function than Canon, and it is really as good as Canon.  They both have their strength and weakness.  Canon just happens to have slightly better high ISO performance and that suits my need better than Nikon.  To be fair, I should mention that the Nikon D200 tops most reviews as the camera of the year, beating the Canon 30D overall.  But the D200 is a bit too advanced for an amateur like me, better suits someone more serious about photography.  The D80 is like a "mini" D200, but slower.  So it really boils down to what you really need and how much you want to spend.  Shooting in low light without flash will need good high ISO performance, a good fast lens (with wide aperture, usually expensive), and image stabilization.  If that's what you want, the Canon 30D with the EF-S 17-55 mm f/2.8 IS will not disappoint you

This can be a very easy to use camera. Simply by using the auto mode and composing your pictures properly you can get very good JPEG images. It also can be about as complicated as you want to make it. It has many advanced features on it. I have been shooting 35mm for about 32 years. My most recent before this one being an Elan II E about 7 years ago. It's still working also. The 30d is my first digital and I absolutely love the camera. I generally work in the aperture priority mode with a tripod at 100 ISO when shooting landscape. But, the camera is very capable in auto mode as well without the tripod. I like to shoot RAW so that I can tweek things a bit, but the JPEG images are very acceptable. It also works extremely well for portraits. It actually is better than the 35mm to me because it has very low noise even at higher ISOs. 1600 looks about like 800 film to me. This is a very good value for the money in my opinion

I upgraded from the Canon Digital Rebel (grey body) to this because I was ready to take my photography to a new level. One thing I like most about this camera is it's flash compenstation. I purchased the 430ex flash with it because I was tired of having to use the built in flash and always getting those hard shadows on the wall

Be careful when you use this lens because it does not have IS (image stabilizer) so if you have shaky hands and the exposure is any more than 1/8 of a second you are going to going to get some blur. This is why the lens is so cheap. This is especially bad when you are at the far end spectrum of this lens. If you are really zoomed in and it's cloudy then you should know to use a tripod just in case. This goes for any lens, but if you will be using the 300-mm end of this then use a tripod. 

It's common sense, but I've loaned out this lens and they complained to me afterwards

This is the same charger came with my digital rebel, however, I like to charge two batteries at a time. So, I bought a second charger and place them side by side on the power strip. 

The prongs for the outlet fold over and into the back of the charger making the charger very compact, flat and easy to take along with you. It's nice having a charger without long cords to fuss with.

I have been using this lens for about 2.5 years and it is an exceptional piece of equipment, especially for the price!
I very rarely feel the need to get a closer image than I can achieve with this lens.  
It's very solidly built and I am sure it will continue to be a primary piece in my kit for years to come

I am THRILLED with this lens's capabilities and the pictures it does.  I test shot a corner of a window to determine if it would be good for my insect shots that I like so well.

Well, it did great as it came but I found that I wanted to have the 1/1 capability so I bought the add-on converter and am thrilled to have added both of these necessary items for my set-up.  I like nature photography the best and like to use my off summer days for hiking and finding photographs to take in perhaps well-known places but finding unique angles and subjects is what I like to specialize in.  This lens will greatly enhance your experience in that 'little world' we commonly trod over or weed-ate away.  I built a diffuser using a ping-pong ball over the flash so the lighting would work better.  (Works great, btw).

As usual, it's great Canon glass that does the trick

I purchased this lens to take photographs of vintage wristwatches.  I use an original Canon Digital Rebel and the shots are really very detailed.  It is easy to use in fact, I can hand hold the camera and capture the details in the hand-made craftsmanship of the watches.  Its F2.5 opening is a welcome change when you are use to shooting with a zoom lens and it is quite sharp edge to edge.  If you own a Canon digital SLR and want to pocket some extra coin then this is the lens for you.

I have used this charger & battery package for a while now in my digital SLR, battery performance is excellent! The downside is that the charger has issues: The top bay charges faster than the bottom bay and the batteries get VERY hot when charging, it has not seemed to affect the batteries in the year I have had them. If you are looking for exceptional batteries buy these, and the charger is okay, just beware that it does not charge all NiMH batteries but does do most

I don't have that much stuff, but fits all my DSLR gadgets plus my camcorder.

Fits 
- my Canon Xti with my canon 50 mm attached.
- my kit lens
- my new canon 70-300 IS
- my panasonic video cam
- minor accessories (extra batteries, cables, memory cards, etc)

There are separators with velcros inside, so you can configure the bag however you want it.

The only issue I have with this bag is that I wan't able to configure it to store my Xti with my 70-300 attached

This is a good Teleconverter that added 1.5x to the camera's native zoom. It adds a great degree of stability to the camera for taking those critical shots. Of course when the digital zoom is used it is very sensitive to shake and movement. Overall a good addition especially for the birds and nature shots

If you have the big lenses (400mm f/2.8L IS USM or even the 70-200mm f/2.8L IS USM) this is totally worth the addition. The 2x does NOT kill the autofocus on the f/2.8 and effectively doubles your lens with very little distortion around the edges. Check compatability on Canon's website. You won't be disappointed

Purchased a printer dock and camera bundle, from a local office supply store for $100. It only came with a 10 picture sample cartridge, so I purchsed this from amazon. Amazon had the best price around on this item and free shipping. It works great. No complaints. The paper is not quite as shiny and or as thick as the epson photo glossy paper that I still use for some pictures, but works well for my classroom, to give to my students. The pictures do not run like some inkjet pictures do if you accidentally drip water on them

I am 67 years old and started out in photography as a kid with a contact printer and a box camera. I have had all types of cameras over the years, mostly 35mm film Canon slr's. I too bought all sorts of these 5-7 MP point and shoot digital cameras before returning to my true love, SLR's. I have had my digital Canon Rebel XT about a month now and I can't keep my hands off of it. It lacks nothing. Although the kit lense is good, I bought a 28-135 Canon zoom lense with image stabilizion and have produced stunning photo's with it. I love the way you can use the 7 points to focus, I mainly use only the center point with focus lock and never get an out of focus picture. I guess the nicest thing for me is that I now don't have the urge to buy every point and shoot camera that is paraded out on QVC or HSN that has a "wonderful" new feature like "low light or non-shake." This Canon has every good feature in the known universe and you can't outgrow it. Its a camera that will let you be as good as you can be, it won't hold you back. The battery life is great, the built in flash is good but I bought a 430EX and that's even better. I never figure I'm wasting money buying accessories for this camera as it will be my main squeeze for many years to come. I always missed my 35mm Canon slr's and now feel that I have an old friend back again, only much much better. Believe me, you can't go wrong getting this camera, its beyond description...

I love the new digital Canon. The only problem is it's not nearly as tough as it's film twin.  I had the camera less than a month when the pop-up flash quit working.  The Canon people have been great, and very helpful, but I'd rather not have had to send a brand new camera back to the factory.  The photos, however, are wonderful.  Film quality for the most part - printable and enlargable.  (It would probably be better to use the camera with a tripod when using the 300mm telephoto but I hike with it, so just remember to steady it before taking wildlife photos.

Now, this isn't the fastest card on the market.  But it is a solid, reliable card.  The camera itself is the bottle kneck, and typically not this card.  However, if you are using a Canon DSLR of a recent flavor, I would check if it needs to be RMA'd.  A known quantity of these cards have proven to lose images.  scary.  However, I've not experienced the mysterious loss of images with my card or Rebel XT.  I've only ever pushed the cards speed limits with my PD70X, and definately not with my Rebel XT

This is a great camera.  Plenty of resolution. Excellent shot speed.  Sturdy frame.  The kit lense doesn't do the camera justice.  Buy the body separate and add a better lense.

On the bad side, I had a small glitch with the camera's firmware soon after purchase and had to return it for a fix.  It was two months before the camera was returned.  Sorry, Canon...  you lose a star for that

"Wow!" is all I can say to express my reaction after getting prints taken with my 17-40.  I've been using Nikon manual-focus Nikkors since 1988 and was always satisfied with the color and sharpness.  However, after using the Canon "L" series, I've sold a lot of my Nikkors.  The color, clarity, sharpness, and detail of the "L" lenses are amazing.  The prints have this 3-D effect (without having to use those silly red/blue glasses!) 8-)  Within 3 weeks of receiving my 17-40, I ordered the 70-200.  Those two lenses will replace my whole Nikkor collection.  Build is really good.  The "L" zooms are a little bulkier, but very managable.  The Nikkors are smaller, but very heavy.  But lense technology and coatings have improved so much in 20 years, I can see the difference.  I tested the lens by pointing it toward the sun.  The 17-40 surprising handles flare very well.  With the sun just outside the field of view, there was very little flare and loss of contrast.  I also make 12x18 prints, and this lens handles them easily.  The body is going to be the limiting factor (refering to digital bodies).
Warning: once you use "L" glass, you are going to be spoiled.  You may not settle for consumer lenses anymore, although some non-L lenses are quick good from what I read

Don't listen to the reviews that claim that this lens is not a good choice for cropped sensor cameras (IE the 20D, 30D, Rebels etc) the Canon L lens are the best and this particular lens is no exception. I have had the lens for less than 24 hours now and am in love with the sharpness and color already. 

Great lens, great color, so well built, super sharp, just watch out if this is your first L lens, you'll be hooked.

This is a lens you will have for many years, great investment

Hi have a Rebel Extreme, and needed to use the high-speed mode... but the flash couldn't even vaguely keep up.  I was taking pictures of dancers, so needed a flash system that could keep up.  The Speedlite really does this perfectly - I'm able to take a rapid-fire sequence of photos, and this flash system is there each time.  I don't know if it really helps when taking a single photo, but if you want a flash that can keep up, this one is great!  I like it so much, I'm planning on buying one or two more for my next shoot, to run in slave mode with this one.

I'm new to the digital SLR world. I had been using the built in flash on my Rebel XT. The built-in flash had done alright, but was nothing to write home about. Since I had spent most of my money on the camera, I needed a flash that was both affordable and would get the job done. This flash met both requirements. IF you are an advance user, you will want a higher end flash because the flash has limited adjuastable features. Yet, if you a newbie like me, this flash is GREAT! It has improved my picture quality dramaticly.

I bought this flash to use on my Canon Rebel XT. The first thing I noticed was that without even reading the instructions I was able to get much better results on pictures taken indoors. Being able to bounce the flash off the white ceilings provided much better color contrasts to the built in flash. Even when I set my camera to shoot quick pictures in succession the flash did not let me down. It did not need anytime to recharge at all.
I recently just came back from vacation and took a lot of outdoor evening shots. Most of the pictures came back with great results. The only dissappointment I have is that when taking shots from further distance than I normally would, the pictures came back darker than I would've liked. So, to compensate for this I adjusted the flash exposure on my camera and although it was an improvement it was a hassle taking several test shots before getting it right.
Another problem I have with the flash is the battery cover. It's flimsy and I find it awkward to open and close at times. I always feel like I'm gonna snap it off by accident.
Overall I am happy. It's a good flash for the price you pay. The battery life is good. I still haven't even had to recharge the batteries and I've almost taken 200 shots with it. My low light picture have improved dramatically by investing in an external flash. Anyone with a decent camera should never use the built in flash. The difference is night and day

The camera handles very well - it's light and drives my Zoom lens and 18-55mm lens beautifully. I get professional photographs and can use it all day without suffering from heavy weight, which it does not have. The view finder is excellent and the readout on the back of the camera is extremely helpful, showing photos as they are taken - with zoom on the back screen, which immediately gives me the idea of the photo I want to use in my books. I say this is an outstanding lens and camera.

This lens is outstanding. Speed and sharpness are top-notch. I use this lens for a wide array of situations and it has always delivered impressive results. Best lens in it's class at a reasonable price. It's well built, sturdy, and not so heavy so it's relatively easy to carry around. Canon really impressed me with this lens. I use it with my EOS system (traditional and digital cameras).

Had the 70-200 f/4 and loved it to pieces with a D60, and now with a 1D MKII, but sold the 4.0 in order to pay for a 35-350, which is my work horse. Due to the push and pull feature however, the 35-350 gets dusty quick in good ol' Montana land, so it has to go in for cleanings every once in a while, and the f/stop isn't always desirable for certain situations.  The 70-200 F/2.8 is amazing. The twist zoom is a little close to the camera, so it takes some twisting of the wrist to get it where you need it, and IMHO, is a bit too much of a turn to be from 70 to 200 in the time one might need for extreme sports. (Rodeo, NASCAR etc) The clarity of this piece of glass just blew me away. I did a comparison of images from my 70-200 F/4 when it was new, and the 2.8 is still visibly sharper. I put an expensive filter on it, as my equipment is asked a lot of in very harmful conditions, and I do notice the slightest big of distortion with a filter, even though it is a good B&W..... so when I can, I shoot the lens with no filter if I require extreme detail. The 35-350L is nowhere near the quality of this little 2.8... if it weren't for the difference in distance, this lens would be my one and only. Oh, and I love the IS. As it is my first IS Lens, I treasure is, but know I will not buy another distance lens without it

I use this gem on my 20D along with my 24-105mm, and as far as I'm concerned it is one of the best optical lenses out there. My 24-105 isn't the ideal indoor/low light lens nor is it the ideal sports photography lens( although it is sharp, just not quite long enough) The 70-200 fills in that gap in my arsenal with IS to boot! The photos I've taken so far on the sidelines are all keepers. If you can afford it, do it, you won't regret i

I spent alot of time evaluating this product.  Finally after reading the reviews I dug deep and spent the extra dollars to get this lense.  It has been a wounderful addition to my Canon Reble.  It is a very high quality product that is easy to use and delivers beautiful shot every time.

From a pure image quality standpoint, this lens will not please the pixel peepers.  On the wide end of the zoom, which I personally use more often than the telephoto end, this lens is not very sharp, and it suffers from fairly bad distortion.  Worse than that, for me, are the chromatic abberations; this lens is quite prone to significant CA when shot at the wide end, which can look a lot worse than a little bit of distortion or softness.  Given the price of this lens, one should expect a higher level of optical performance.

The maximum aperture of this lens is not very large, being f/4 on the wide end, and f/5.6 on the telephoto end.  The image stabilization makes up for this some, as you can comfortably shoot at much slower shutter speeds than otherwise, but, let's be honest here; this lens is a poor performer if you want to shoot in low light with no tripod.  The small aperture makes for a dark viewfinder, which can be a very big problem if you are trying to compose a picture in the dark (using a tripod).

Yet, I still gave this very imperfect lens four stars, and this is not without reason.


First of all, the focal length range is quite handy.  It isn't a mega-zoom that does everything, however, it covers the most often used focal length ranges, and is an appropriate lens to use for the vast majority of situations.  The little bit of extra zoom on the telephoto end is handy on occasion, and it's also worth noting that the lens sharpens up quite a bit when you zoom in some - it might be soft on the wide end, but zoomed in, it's quite good.

I have printed as large as 20x30" using this lens on a Digital Rebel, and have no qualms with the results.  Yes, there are sharper lenses out there, but you are a lot more likely to see the difference in sharpness on your computer monitor than in a print.

This lens has ring USM, which enables it to focus very quietly, and very quickly, whereas the slightly cheaper (and F2.8) options from the 3rd parties have normal focusing motors that are slow and noisy by comparison.

If you want to use this lens indoors, you are best off getting a flash to go with it, such as a 430EX.  The lens is usable in fantastic indoor lighting, or during the day, but won't give you good results in low light with no flash.  


If you will be shooting in lower light situations (people in particular), Tamron and Sigma have some good options in the 17-50mm range with F2.8 apertures, and I would recommend those lenses over this one.  If you'd prefer the extra telephoto range, the image stabilization so you can shoot with smaller aperture in poorer lighting situations for greater depth of field (instead of needing to shoot a landscape at f/4, for instance, without image stabilization, you could use f/11 on this lens, and get a sharp picture with better depth of field.  This is even more useful in the close focus range - while this isn't a true macro lens, if you take closeup photos without a tripod, you will want to stop the lens down for greater depth of field, and the IS helps with that quite a bit.


Overall, I've been fairly pleased with the performance of this lens.  If you like to worry about splitting hairs, and zooming all the way in on pictures on your computer, this lens is likely to dissapoint you.  If, however, you are willing to sacrifice optical perfection to get a very well rounded, useful lens, then I'd recommend it, however, would also recommend that you consider the 3rd party options, as they are also great lenses, and do offer a somewhat better value

I purchased this tripod from 47th Street Photo through Amazon.com.  The tripod appeared to arrive in good shape, except that the operating instructions were not included.  I immediately emailed 47th Stree Photo at the customer service address printed on the flyer they included with my shipment.  I asked them if they would be able to send me a copy of the operating instructions.  They did not respond to my email, so a few days later I emailed them again.  Once again, no response.  I then emailed Amazon.com, and informed them of the missing instructions and the non-responses from 47th Street Photo.  No response from Amazon either!  As far as the tripod goes, it appears to be a very good value for the money.  I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars because, due to the missing operating instructions, I cannot be certain I have properly checked out all of its features.  However, I am certain that both 47th Street Photo and Amazon.com rate zero stars for customer service.  I will use neither one again

I needed this tripod to use with my 20X50 binoculars since the least movement with 20X magnification causes the subject to wind up outside the viewing field.

This tripod works well for that use.  It is sturdy, has lots of features and is reasonably priced.

However, if you wish to use the tripod for binoculars, a right angle adapter will be needed.  I found one on eBay for a few dollars.

I received the tripod ahead of the expected schedule. I've been looking at tripods in stores in and around the greater Boston area. 

You can't get a better tripod for the money. In fact, you can't get anything "decent" for under $40-50 and even then I'm not sure you will get something this good. 

I had it shipped to my job and a few guys in the office (which I didn't know) had purchased a tripod in the past and where really impressed when I told them I only paid $25 for it. 

Conclusion: is the tripod perfect, NO. The head looks a little like plastic. But it has nice rubber feet and rubber grip in addition to everything listed on the website. This tripod is perfect for the beginner to enthusiast photographer.

I am impressed with the quality of photos with this camera. Occaisionally when I turn it on the lense doiesn't slide out, which is a little disconcerting. However, if I tap it, or turn it off and turn it o n again, it comes out to the operational position. I enjoy using it, amd wouldn't hesitate to purchase another one

The Digital Rebel is the most amazing camera i've ever owned. My previous camera was a Canon A90 and I loved using all the features on it [great camera!]. I decided recently that maybe I should graduate to a SLR because I was starting to get more creative with my photography. I spent a great deal of time researching cameras and finally decided on the Digital Rebel. After a few months of owning it I still am amazed. The image quality is fantastic, it's quick and responsive, and every day using it I learn a little more. It's the perfect intro SLR camera for me because everything makes sense and it's easy to learn. I've gotten amazing shots that I could never dream of getting with a point and shoot. 

If you are finding yourself wanting a little more than a point and shoot, go for this camera, you wont be sorry.

I am 67 years old and started out in photography as a kid with a contact printer and a box camera. I have had all types of cameras over the years, mostly 35mm film Canon slr's. I too bought all sorts of these 5-7 MP point and shoot digital cameras before returning to my true love, SLR's. I have had my digital Canon Rebel XT about a month now and I can't keep my hands off of it. It lacks nothing. Although the kit lense is good, I bought a 28-135 Canon zoom lense with image stabilizion and have produced stunning photo's with it. I love the way you can use the 7 points to focus, I mainly use only the center point with focus lock and never get an out of focus picture. I guess the nicest thing for me is that I now don't have the urge to buy every point and shoot camera that is paraded out on QVC or HSN that has a "wonderful" new feature like "low light or non-shake." This Canon has every good feature in the known universe and you can't outgrow it. Its a camera that will let you be as good as you can be, it won't hold you back. The battery life is great, the built in flash is good but I bought a 430EX and that's even better. I never figure I'm wasting money buying accessories for this camera as it will be my main squeeze for many years to come. I always missed my 35mm Canon slr's and now feel that I have an old friend back again, only much much better. Believe me, you can't go wrong getting this camera, its beyond description...

If you're looking for a high-quality telephoto zoom lens that is fast enough to use indoors, you may have found what you're looking for.  The 70-200/2.8 lens produces beautiful results that are overall on par with the 135/2 prime lens (although not quite as sharp).

The main downside to this lens is that it's big and heavy.  I don't mind carrying it around my neck on the camera so much, but when you go to use if you have to put extra effort into keeping the lens from shaking in your hands due to the weight.  And it's not exactly the sort of lens that I would want to toss into my backpack, just due to the immense size.

If you don't mind spending an extra $500, consider also the 70-200/2.8 IS (image stabilization) version of this lens.  It weighs even more, but the built in IS unit should help compensate for shaky hands whilst using the lens

I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) 

The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. 

The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it.

In the never ending race for larger and larger megapixel counts, the D70s has fallen behind the pack.  (However, if that's the only measure by which you're judging a digital camera - you really should consider further research before plunking down several hundred dollars.)  Nevertheless, it's quite a good camera.  

What I like about it most:
- It looks and feels solid.  Some of the reviewers that pan this camera for feeling flimsy and plasticky are apparently still stuck in the realm of pro cameras that cost several thousand dollars.  It's not a bulletproof titanium box that you can back a Hummer over, but it certainly seems to outdo DSLRs in it's category.  
- Very good battery life.
- Backwards compatibility with decade's worth of Nikon SLR lenses.

My gripes:
- The latch that keeps the pop-up flash in place broke in less than a week.
- Inability to meter through older manual focus lenses.
- Lack of full functionality with flashes other than the SB-600 and SB-800.  
- Nikon's RAW software and control software aren't included with the camera, and are IMHO overpriced.  (...and on top of that, Nikon has split what used to be one overpriced software package into two overpriced software packages...)

What would improve this camera the most:
- ISO 100 and ISO 3200+ 
- Ability to store multiple custom white balance presets, and then pull them up on the fly.
- Replacing the "idiot modes" (i.e. "portrait", "landscape", etc.) with modes that you could customize

This is my first time to purchase a battery grip for a digital SLR camera and it was a good investment. I don't have to worry about running out of battery power and at the same time it works as a vertical grip for my camera. It also  looks nice on my Canon 30D camera, coupled with an "L" series zoom lens

I started with the battery grip initially wanting the double battery availability. Having used a 35mm with a hand strap and already realizing the value of the stability of such a strap, this was my second attraction for the purchase of the battery grip and last but not at all least, is the ability to use shoot from the grip itself, allowing full ease of rotation of the camera.  Though I have never used the battery magazine that allows for the use of AA batteries, having it offers a backup should the canon batteries need charging and I am in the heat of shooting. I always travel with my charge AND four AA batteries. I would recommend this grip as a standard accessory for the EOS-20D and EOS 30-D. One thought to consider once on the camera it increases the overall height creating challanges with some camera cases.

Over the years I have been using Quantum Turbo and later 2x2 units ( No Turbo SC yet) to power various Canon speed-lights from 540EZ to EX580. With some skepticism I picked this unit as a trial on one wedding assignment. Well, although Quantum units  still have a place in my kit to power Metz Unit, I love the convenience of CP-E3. One recommendation. Buy couple of extra battery inserts, if you do lot of fast shootings, and keep them loaded with good quality Duracell NIMH's

This is a great lens. I do not want to repeat all the good things other reviewers have written about this lens. It is not so heavy so I use tripod without using tripod collar (costs 119.99 in B & H). This is the best value I have ever got for a lens. Now I can't wait to get 17-40mm f4L too. You can get a very nice bokeh when wide open at f4 and f5.6, of course depending on the how far the background is from the subject. 
People complain how ugly the hood looks but that is subjective. I like it because it works great and you can attach it in a reversed position on the lens so that it will fit in your camera bag. I think the fit and finish of the lens is beautiful

I owned this lens for about a year before upgrading to the image stabilized f/2.8 version.  Overall I was very happy with the f/4 lens and miss having it available because of the significantly lower weight.  Sharpness is amazing and comparable for both lenses, and the f/4 can provide plenty of background blur.  If you are shooting mostly outdoors I would recommend the f/4.

This was the best item I ever bought for my camera. I do a lot of walking with my camera, and thought I would use it as a walking stick, which I do, but the best part of this monopod is what I never thought would happen. My pictures are NEVER fuzzy! I can take low light photos and have they come out clear. I paid very little for this item and would never be caught without it and my camera. The three levers on the bottom allow for quick expansion at all different lengths. The carrying case allows for this item to be packed next to my camera without it getting scratched

Not knowing fully what I was getting into, on a whim I purchased this monopod hoping that is was a half-way decent product, I mean-it was so cheap.  I was pleasantly surprised to find how sturdy the unit was and that what I had was a very high quality monopod.  This was my second monopod and so I had another to compare it with (the other was bought on an auction website).  In comparison the Opteka was a far better monopod in height and robust thickness and I use it exclusively on my miniDV shoots

I have taught photography at the college level, shoot 4x5 view camera work on occasion, and am very demanding about image quality.   I am quite satisfied with the image quality from my Kodak P880, particularly after I installed the newest firmware upgrade available from Kodak.

I went through several 7MP to 8 MP cameras before finally getting the Kodak P880.  The P880 has better image quality than some high end Sonys and Olympus 7-8 MP cameras like the DSC-V3 or the SP350.  I tested the P880 against the even higher end 10.3 MP large sensor Sony R1 and the difference in image quality in a 13x19 print between the P880 and the R1 was barely perceptible after minor sharpening and noise reduction, which the P880 images accept particularly well.   The zoom lens has a very useful range and is generally pretty sharp throughout its range.   Balance, manual controls and features feel high end and adequate for most semi-professional needs.   The camera is a little slow processing and storing pictures in RAW format and exposure bracketing modes but that really doesn't bother me because I do mostly landscape and fine art photos.   RAW file format is directly supported by most versions of Adobe Photoshop and Photoshop Elements as well as most other RAW processing programs like Bibble Pro.  Unlike most sub-$500 cameras, the P880 uses regular screw in haze and polarizing filters, a real plus and it has a highly controllable hot shoe.   Manual focus is usable and manual exposure control works well.   The direct mechanical zoom is also nice.

Overall, the P880 is a digital camera that can either be a high end point and shoot SLR-styled camera or one that can be used as fully manually as the most classic 35 mm film SLR.   

Although not small enough to slip in a pocket, the size is still reasonable and light

The new Nikon EN-EL3e battery is a slight update for the Nikon EN-EL3 provided with earlier dSLR models such as the D70. It adds a contact that allows new cameras to determine how much charge is left in the battery. The battery is grey to distinguish it from the black EN-EL3.

The EN-EL3e is backwards compatible with the EN-EL3: you can put it in your D70 or D50. The reverse is not true.

The number of pictures that the battery gives you depends on a lot of factors, including shooting style, LCD usage, and of course, camera. (The 2.5" LCD on the D200 will use up the battery much quicker than the smaller D70.) It is sufficient for a day of shooting. Unless you are using a D200 in some professional capacity, in which case, you'll probably be investing in at least one backup battery

This is my first and very expensive entry into digit SLR photography.
I have used canon point and shoot digital camera previously.

I was avoiding DSLR's because I used to rarely use my EOS film SLR.
The convienience of a point and shoot from that experience was overwhelming.
Unfortunately so are it's limitations.

So back I came, and the only choice though expensive was the EOS 5d for it's full frame sensor! The pain was reduced by the double rebates.

Wow! This is a revelation! Beautifull images, lot of control.

I did notice that the AF was not as fast as my old Elan IIE.

I was also disappointed that for the price there was a lack of weather sealing. I am not happy with canon for this, but I really appreciate them for making a full frame sensor in a difficult marketable slot as far as their line up was concerned.

This camera also needs prime or L lenses, because the sensor will reveal the inadequacies of inferior lenses. This add's to the cost.

This is an exceptional photographic tool that I hope to use to improve my skill as I explore all it's capabilities

There's no question that paying $100 or more will get you a better monopod. But for $16 the Sima SMP-1 is a tremendous value. 

I have a Sony DSC-W5 digital camera and have done everything I can think of to reduce camera-shake in low-light photos. This monopod has been great for adding stability and making my photos less blurry. 

The key is that it is small enough and light enough that I can take it almost wherever I go. And because it's so small, I can bring it in to places that would frown upon a tripod. 

A monopod is not a total replacement for a tripod. But this monopod is now the only addition to my camera that I take on trips

I purchased this case for my Canon A530 camera. I find that it does a great job of being light,durable,and compact. It keeps the camera clean and scratch free. However I wish the case had a better carrying capacity. I would have liked a bit more space for spare batteries and chips. I use different ones for different pictures or video. Batteries do tend to give out after a long day shooting and convient extras would be handy.
 The case has beltloops but not a good shoulder strap for times when a belt is not worn. That can be a bit akward. Otherwise this case is a good protector of my camera and fits it well.

I've had this camera for three years.  I bought it new, when it was cutting edge and very expensive.  I put a 128MB CF card in it.

First, I have to say that I have NEVER had the slightest problem with this camera or the software.  I've probably taken upwards of 5000 pictures with it, it's been all over the country.  The software has been installed on Windows 95, 98, 2000 and XP and I haven't had any problems with it.  The camera is solid, performs well, takes good pictures, and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the LCD viewfinder. If battery life were that big a deal, one could purchase a second battery and rotate.

All that said, I am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera.  They are razor sharp, the color balance is perfect, and the focus is great.  When taking pictures of people, however, it shows EVERY flaw in the subject's skin.  Scratches, oil, freckles are magnified and come out looking horrific.  It requires extensive Photoshopping to fix the flaws.  Other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better.  

I will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture. By the time the shot's taken, something (especially a squirmy child or a sports play) has invariably moved and it's not the exact picture you wanted.

I'm going to buy a real Single-Lens Reflex (SLR) to take baby pictures, but I'll keep this as a travel camera

If you're a professional photographer, you can probably ignore this review. But then you probably won't be thinking about buying this lens anyway, as you'll be off to purchase a nice L series.

However, if - like me - you just happen to have a nice Canon Digital Rebel camera (or equivalent) and enjoy taking decent pictures, this lens will probably work out very well for you. I've taken well over 1000 pictures with it in a couple of weeks, and it has performed very much as expected. For the price, it's perfect for a go-everywhere lens.

A few main points. Okay, it's not the best image quality. Even on low/medium ISO it seems a little grainy and its not as sharp as some of the more expensive Canon lenses. It struggles indoors unless you have a good flash unit, but for well-lit outdoor shoots it's works  very well.

Of course, it would be nice to have a nice L series with IS, but if you can't afford that then this is a very good value lens. Not for the real professionals, but great if you don't take things too seriously and just want a bit more zoom - and, let's face it, who doesn't want a but more zoom

I purchased this lens for my Canon EOS 20D digital camera and so far I really like it.  It focuses fast and produces very sharp, clear images.  As with any longer lens you do have to be careful about camera shake; I've had a few images come out blurry but these are usually interior shots.  I really like the 28-200mm focal length range and find the lens to be very versatile for framing wide shots of buildings or landscapes to zoomed in shots for portraits or close detail shots.  The lens feels solid and appears to be well constructed, which is typical for Canon products.  For the price range, this is an excellent lens.  You can only do better by spending considerable more money on an IS lens

I bought this lens a little over a year ago for macro shooting.  I quickly found out, however, that to shoot Macro-only with this lens is a crime.  It is a very versitile lens.  Its fast f/2.8 aperture makes for good shooting in low light.  I pretty much use this outdoors as the 100mm with the 1.6x crop factor of my Rebel XT eliminates most indoor oppurtunities.

I frequently use this lens for family portraits, the resultant photo is so crisp and clear and the bokeh really helps add snap to the primary subject.

As others have stated, this is a heavy lens.  It doesn't have Image Stabilization (IS) so a tripod or monopod is a great accessory to get the best images.  I use a beefy monopod for my best shots, although I have a lot of handheld gems...

If you are tight for cash, this isn't the "one lens" that does it all.  If you are looking for a versitile lens that can do outstanding macros and portraits, THIS is that lens.

I wanted to get a macro lens and everyone told me this was the one to get... I'm so glad I did. With the smaller sensor on my 30D, the 100mm is more like 150mm or so, so it's a nice , wide-open telephoto/portrait lens as well. I've uploaded a few photos I've taken w/ this lens to show what it's capable of in macro and telephoto. I thought the 17mm-85mm IS USM lens that came e/ my camera was sharp - but compared to this lens, the kit lens might as well be from a DIY pinhole camera.

My less than perfect rating is that there is no image stabilization available for the macro lenses. When I'm trying to hone in on bees pollenating a flower, there is a lot of shake. I can't practically use a tripod when the insects are bouncing from bud to bud, so I have to take 100 shots to get one that's not shake blur - and I miss some really cool shots. 

In addition to the lack of image stabilization, I am frustrated w/ the sometimes unpredictable focusing that will happen as the lens is trying to decide whether it should be focusing at telephoto or macro. I wish there was a switch on the lens to make it macro only or telephoto only, so it wouldn't be bouncing from one focal length to the other all the time.

I've taken far more successful telephoto shots than macro. The telephoto focal length is a bit long (for those of us who cannot afford a full-frame sensor camera) for most casual photography. I recently used this lens to shoot some promo shots of some massage therapists in a small eatery. I practically had to set up in the restaurant's bathroom to get the photos I wanted, but opted for this lens because it's much faster (2.8) and I wanted to use natural light over flash.

The lens is long and heavy for its range. With the addition of the battery pack grip, this lens added on is very weighty, so I may not take it w/ me in my kit bag on every shoot. Once I add another short fixed focal length lens and a moderate telephoto to my kit, my guess is that this lens will be pulled out for only special occasions.

It's tack-sharp, but it can be frustrating at times

I read many reviews at fredmiranda.com before I purchased this lens and I was not dissapointed one bit. I was lucky enough to receive a very sharp copy of this lens on the first try. The macro shots were very sharp and contrasty. The center part is already reaching near maximum sharpness at F2.8  Anything beyond F4 is tack sharp. Be carefull with this lens though. The DOF at F2.8 is extremely narrow. Don't mistaken the out of focus shots for being unsharp. Focus properly and crank up the aperture and you'll get some very satisfying macro shots. The only thing I wish this lens had was image stabilizer. Canon, how about a 100mm macro with IS?

The Digital Rebel is the most amazing camera i've ever owned. My previous camera was a Canon A90 and I loved using all the features on it [great camera!]. I decided recently that maybe I should graduate to a SLR because I was starting to get more creative with my photography. I spent a great deal of time researching cameras and finally decided on the Digital Rebel. After a few months of owning it I still am amazed. The image quality is fantastic, it's quick and responsive, and every day using it I learn a little more. It's the perfect intro SLR camera for me because everything makes sense and it's easy to learn. I've gotten amazing shots that I could never dream of getting with a point and shoot. 

If you are finding yourself wanting a little more than a point and shoot, go for this camera, you wont be sorry.

I love the bag for all the reasons others did not like it.  The product is listed as a gadget bag and that is what it is good at.  The S2 IS is a large camera for a point and shoot and it fits in very few bags.  This bag fit the camera easily and had space for all types of extras including batteries, chargers and extra media cards.  There is also enough room for another small digital camera or a film point and shoot.  

The correct way to advertise this case would have been for up to two bodies or four small lens.  Given that limitation, this is a great bag.

The bag is very well made and holds my Canon Powershot S2 IS very securely.  I lay the camera on it's back and that means that even if I accidently power it on the lens opens harmlessly.  The material is great and the waist belt is very practical.  The strap is well padded and after a day of use I believe it is one of the most comfortable straps I have used.  

Buy this bag for the correct camera and you will be very happy with it.

Got the Lowero SlingShot 100 about 2 months ago, and it is really coming in handy.  In the main area, it holds my pentax digital slr with one lens mounted, 1 rather small lens and 1 decently big zoom lens (80-320mm), plus a Sigma EF-500 Super flash.  It's packed in there, and the flash just barely fits, but i don't need much more room.  The top compartment holds extra batteries, recharger, etc.  Really easy to access the main pocket when it is on my back...just by pulling the case to my front (no need to take it off my back).  Well made.  Zippers are strong so I don't have to worry about one loosening and my equipment falling out.  Perfect for the amateur to semi-pro photographer.

This lens is amazing. Nothing escapes it. It's like a black hole. Clearly the best lens I have ever owned. It's like the lidless Eye of Sauron from the Lord of the Rings. It is heavy and requires rethinking how you hold the camera. It comes with a beautiful case, a hood, and a tripod mount on the lens. Believe me you will need it. I took a few photos of my son from 250 feet away and they look great. I will now get to work reading the small manual. It has 2 focal settings and 2 stabilizing settings. Wow!

This thing is perfect for carrying your stuff around in a not-so-fattening way.  I hvae an external flash, macro kit, 28-80 lens, 50mm lens, 18-55mm lens, DSLR w/batt grip and 75-300mm lens ATTACHED all fit into the main body of this thing.  Everything is seperated by the dividers making me feel confident and safe while walking, hiking, biking, etc.  The addon pouches seem to make it a bit more bulking that you'd want, but the bag all by itself is fantastic and I can't recommend it enough - get away from huge bulky shoulder bags!!  Lowepro did it again

After using both lenses I think this is much better. Here are my reasons:

1- f 2.8 makes the autofocus much faster and accurate.
2- Bokeh is much better in this one.
3- Macro is slightly better on this one.
4- 105 mm does make a very little difference in image size.
5- IS is not very crucial in 24-50 range.

I think it very well could be so I'm not going to differ with those who say it is.I bought this to use with a new 5D and itt's simply outstanding in every regard. So far, I've kept it on the 5D and can't bring myself to take it off. 

I considered a couple of lenses, including the IS 24-105 f/4 which has a lot of appeal and the price is about the same. But this was the lens I chose in part because I already have a the 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6 DO IS Lens and the overlap seemed a waste while the extra stop helps.  I have no regrets about it. sharp as a tack and quick. 

I note that this is not compact lens, especially with the hood on and it can stretch out a lot when you widen the field. It is also not light. This lens and the 5D will give your neck and back a pain, assuming you work with more than one camera. But the focal lengths covered are just about ideal and require none of the compromises that a longer zoom range require. For that, I've got an 18-200 on a 20D. The 70-300 DO, while not an L, specs out in that range and has the virtue of real compactness, but it' not a lightweight. These two lenses cover just about everything for me. And I can keep the 10-22mm on the 20D for the extra-wide shots.

Since writing the initial review, I've since traveled for several weeks with this lens and it fully lived up to expectations. Given the difficulties of travel these days, I am concerned about the problem of not being able to carry it with me -- not a problem to date except for Britain. But always possible. And, despite the weight, I might favor the 70-200 F/2.8L IS USM as a second travel lens- I like the brightness of the focus.

One suggestion. There's a temptation to use this lens wide open a lot of the time. It's very good and sometimes that's the best thing. But I've also found this lens makes beautiful images stopped down a good deal for short night time exposures on a tripod and a remote release. The effect with lights, etc. is considerably different along with the extended depth of field.

If you are shooting with a compact chip camera like the 20D or rebel xt, you will be happier with the 8mm fisheye.  This 15mm fisheye will just be a really distorted wide angle lens due to the 1.6 factor.  If you love the fish eye style and have that camera, you'll need something WIDER to compensate for your smaller chip.

I was disapointed with this lens for that reason.  The Sigma 8mm is great.  A note to the reviewer below.  Sigma makes some good lenses and bad ones.  This is a good one and you probably got a bad copy.  It happens often enough with sigma gear.  With this lens, its good to go and try one at your local camera shop and make sure it has the style you want.  Bring YOUR camera with a chip in it and take a few shots and go home to check them out.  Decide if you like the style and if that piece of glass is a good copy.

I got a good copy and was still disapointed because of my lack of knowledge.  Sounds like you got a bad one

15 years of photography experience here... The Sigma 15mm fisheye has been extensively reviewed and compared by other websites (go ahead and search) and this is a very good product. The canon has a tighter focus and a *touch* faster in focusing, but with the massive depth of field with this lens, it's not a problem at all. 

Be aware that if you use this on a 1.6 crop factor digital SLR that has APS sensors like my 20D or digital rebel, then the fisheye effect is not as pronounced on film or 1.3 or full frame digital SLRs. 

Watch lens flare should direct sunlight hit it also...but that happens to any lens that has protruding or bulbous lenses. 

This is a much better bang for the buck lens than the canon equivalent which costs significantly more. If you search around, you can find much lower prices on this lens

This lens pouch is very durable and is of a good quality. It compacts down and does not have unneccesary bulk. Might seem alittle pricey but is worth it in the long haul.

I am not much of a photographer. I found this camera easy to use and my pix are just great. Believe me, it's the camera.  The stabilizer thing works to give clear focus almost every time. I can even put the pix up on the computer and send them easily.  I'm thrilled. You do need to upgrade to a 1 mgb. memory card when you buy the camera.

It is a great compact camera with a good zoom.  I can now leave a larger lens on my Nikon DX 70 and use this for closer shots.  YOu do need to try different settings to make sure you get the color you want. I really like it for most general quick shots, carry it wth me most of the time

<review_text>
This camera has been called a "pro-sumer" model and you should really take that title seriously. The quality of the pictures that it takes are just as good as a professional digital camera of the same resolution. The trade off is that it is really not happy being thrown in a bag (or big pocket, if it fits). Why? Because Canon have given it a really annoying power-on switch that is guaranteed to turn the camera on 90% of the time when you're moving it to or from a bag. To compound this problem, the lens extends (in your bag), pushing off the lens cap and leaving it open for possible damage. So, if you think of this as a professional camera, to be kept in a real camera-case, you'll probably be okay. If you're somebody, like me, who likes to throw his camera in a bag or pocket, you're going to be annoyed by the power switch. That said, I do LOVE the quality of the pictures and all control that the camera gives you over every aspect of taking them.

CONS: stupid power-on switch that always catches and turns camera on; lens cap is kind of loose and falls off easily; widest angle is maybe a little too telephoto still (around 35mm?)

PROS: awesome pictures; tons of controls all over the outside of the camera allowing you to control a lot without having to resort to menus; professional features including flash hot-shoe and replaceable lens; great battery life; awesome picture

I bought this filter for my 28-135 IS canon lens and so far it has worked out great.  Unlike some of the other tiffen filters I bought, this one fits just right on the lens.  All sides are even and it sits flush against the lens.  I haven't noticed any artifacts from pictures I've taken yet, but I haven't really had much of a chance to take many pictures with the lens.  The night shots I've take so far, I've been quite pleased with, however

i have another camera w/ 12x optical & tons of features but i wanted something compact & ready to take quick snaps. this fits the bill. on my recent vacation i was impressed with how quickly it booted up and focused in to get those unplanned shots. the x-large screen makes it really easy to see if you got a good one and the image stabilisation seems to work better than on my previous camera (canon A80)...either that or my hand is steadier. last but not least - the battery life was impeccable. I took a nearly 200 photos, plus spent a lot of time reviewing and showing off pics to friends with no need to recharge. the battery is a 'custom' one which concerned me but the charger is VERY compact and travels well. it has integrated prongs that fold flat when not in use - no cables :)

I absolutely love this camera. I've told everyone I know to buy it. The picture quality is amazing. There are so many options with this tiny little camera! You can edit pictures before you even print them. Zoom in on a picture already taken and save it that way, and so much more. I take pictures of everything! 

I charged the battery when I got the camera, which was about three weeks ago, and it's still going. I have 7/8th of battery life left. I haven't had to charge it again. 

I am so happy with my purchase! I hope this helps you

I wanted to buy a compact slim d-camera. Those with larger zoom are quite bulky, you can't carry around all the time. I think a slim camera is a better choice. I slip into my pocket while wondering around and come across something nice and take a picture of it. You can't do it with a huge camera. 
After I made up mind about a slim camera, my choices were either Casio Exilim or Sony DSCW series. Casio Exilims are very sexy. They have a lot of mode scenes. They also function as voice recorder. You can take pictures of book pages etc. They have anti-shake capability which is said to reduce blurred images. I was almost buying a Casio Exilim. Being a diligent person I wanted to search more and more. 
I found out that the so-called anti-shake feature is a bogus. Many people found it useless. That was a good reason to choose Casio. Then I found the picture quality of Exilim is not really good.I found some pictures taken with Exilim. They were soft, not crisp colors. Search the web reviews made by photo professionals. Casio Exilim is rated significantly less than Sony in picture quality. With ISO 200 noise was still detectable in most reviews . Those same reviewers however found Sony DSCW doing a better job . There was no noise with ISO 400 which means even in lower light condition Sony did a better job (less granularity in pictures with low light). Big difference!.
One feature of Sony that made it very attractive was its strong macro. It is 0.74 inch which means you can bring your camera 0.74 inch (2 mm) close to an object (say a bug) and still take a brilliant picture of it. 
Now comparison of Exilim and Sony to summarize:
Casio Exilim
Anti-shake (it's a bogus)
Slim   
Lower macro (2.5 inches)
Lower picture quality (detectable noise at ISO 200)
A lot of scene modes
Quick shutter
Sony DSCW Series
Slim (in fact it is slimmer)
Higher macro (0.74 inches)
Higher picture quality (No noise in ISO 400)
Not a lot of scene modes
Quick shutter
So.....I purchased a Sony DSCW 7 Mp. I took lots of pictures.
They are all brilliant, detailed and crisp, true colors.
I tried macro and took pictures of bugs. You can see the hairs on the legs of bugs. Absolutely no noise whatsoever, no blurry.
It's a marvel of technology. I took pictures of fireworks in July 4th using high ISO setting. They came out brialliantly like professional pictures.
It also uses a different kind of battery that you can't buy at your grocery which can leave you vulnerable. So you may wanna buy a spare one (about 40 bucks). But you can always recharge it. And it lasts much much longer than AAA or Nimh batteries. 
It was a perfect choice. I highly recommend it.

I just got this camera a month ago and I am satisfied with it. It has a lot of features despite its size. And for point and shoot I can say it's a great buy, comparable to other power packed cameras, it even takes better pictures sometimes.

But I just had to give it a 4 because I thought I could do more with it. But you can't do much with the settings since it has it's own default settings for certain conditions. But over all it's a great camera. If you're just after taking normal pictures and you want something sleek, this is definitely a good buy.

Yes it is a very fine lens. IS and 105 mm long end are also appealing but after buying this I decided to sell it in favour of my EF 24-70 2.8L after 2 weeks of usage.

f4 makes clearly the autofocus slower and fuzzier. Bokeh is also worse than the other one. 
the viewfinder gets darker in 1.6 crop bodies. 
105 mm does make a very little difference in image size. 
Plus the macro option is weaker on this one.

If you don't care about the weight go with the EF 24-70 2.8L imho.

I own several Canon lens for my 20D and this is hands down the best.  I had a 28-135 which was a very good lens regardless of some reviews, and I got many excellent photos with it - this is distinctly better in all ways.  (Of course, it costs a lot more).  Recently went with the grandchildred to Sea World and I got 100% good photos, with several really outstanding ones.  It is light, accurate and has IS - what more do you want?  You can replace a slew of lens with this one and perhaps selling the old ones will help pay for it.  Bought it as soon as it was available and have not regretted it one moment.  If you have one lens, this is the one

I've had this lens for 2 months now, and love it. It was my first "L" lens and I can see the quality difference in this line. First, I tried the 28-135 IS-pretty good. But I wasn't totally happy, so returned it and ordered the 24-105 L. Now I'm happy. Contrast, sharpness, & CA are much better. Build quality & feel are superior as well. Plus the IS really works. I will try & get all IS lens in the future, I believe it is worth the extra cost. Focusing is very quick and zoom action is smooth & steady. If you're on a budget, the 28-135 is real nice. But to go all the way, I recommend this lens. The IS on the 24-105 L is quieter I found. The price is a bit steep, but optical quality is there, resale value will remain good, and weather sealing should hopefully keep dust and junk from getting inside this lens.

     Despite reading glowing reviews about this lens, I was still surprised to see how well it performed.  The lens is SO sharp you can get very good cropped pictures of running athletes, from a distance of three quarters of a Football field away, shooting hand held, with late afternoon light, which will print a 5x7 and still look like a Pro took them!
If you want a tack sharp lens for indoor sports pictures and can't afford, or otherwise do not want another long lens for outdoor sports pictures, then you should give this lens your serious consideration.

 At a recent NYE event, I shot a lot of photos in a concert setting without a flash and am very impressed with the sharpness & clarity of this lens performance. Its so fast and the colors are vibrant. I am not a seasoned pro but with the 20D and this lens, it makes me look pretty close. I did shoot in manual and once I got my aperture & shutter speed dialed in, it pumped out a lot of great pics.
 I have also shot some pics of waterfalls (slowing down my shutter speed to get that soft flowing image) and portraits of people and again, it oozed excellence. The 135mm focal range is not as convenient as a zoom, but the quality of this prime lens makes up for any incovenience

For the price and quality I rated this lenses with 5 stars.
If you really want to see how good this lens are see the photos I took in Europe.  I too around 5000 photos. I posted a few on the web (See link below).

For the price I recommend this lens as walk around lens. The zoom is pretty usefull They are very realiable and (almost) very sharp. Get this lens instead of the kit lens (18-55 mm) until you are ready to spend more.

Here are some of my pictures taken in Europe with this lens (Images have been compressed):

Every picture of mine that included larger portions of the sky would have these stubborn spores on it. Pretty infuriating, especially when you got the shot just like you wanted it. Yes, you can always remove those on Photoshop (or cheaper yet, The Gimp); but isn't it cool when you look at a picture and say: "that is it, nothing to do on it!" ??

And it wasn't just the sky. Any off-white but light plain colored background would suffer visibly from the acursed specks.

With this blower, greatly priced (pity that Adorama doesn't have free shipping though), I put my camera on the tripod, pointed it down, squirted three or four times - and gone are the specs!!!

Great buy for DSLR owners

I use this little gadget mainly for macro and portrait work.  When you have it on the light emitting from the flash is diffused which gives you a more flattering less contrasty light to illuminate your subjects with.  Unless you are going for a very shadowy, high-contrast, image this diffuser can save the day.  It is very light weight and easy to pack in small places, so you should never have a good reason to leave it behind.  Sometimes it is the simple things that make the biggest difference in a photo, and using this can defiantly make very noticeable differences

This seemingly simple piece of molded plastic was recommended to me by a professional photographer.  Basically it's the shape of an open box that slides firmly onto the flash.  It is small and sturdy enough to stash in your camera bag without worrying about damage.  When used the light disperses more evenly and is less harsh on the subject being photographed.

The white box is for general use.  Also available are the green Omni-bounce for florescent lighting and the gold Omni-bounce for a warming effect.

PROS:
Inexpensive solution for better flash photography.
A quality product that works.

CONS:
Non

After checking prices with all the usual pricing bots, I found a better price, including free shipping, by going directly to Amazon. This lowest price did not appear in the other searches, so it pays to go to Amazon first.

I replaced my Canon SD400 with the Casio and find the controls more logical to use. This is important if you don't use the camera for a while, because you can just pick it up and start shooting without hunting for the manual. Also, the docking base is much more convenient than plugging small cables into the camera. You do not have to remove the battery in the Casio to charge it as you do with the Canon SD400. The VGA movie quality is superior on the Casio. Still pictures appear to be about equal. 

Amazon delivered by UPS in record time even with a weekend inbetween. I ordered on a Friday and received it the following Tuesday. Go with Amazon!

This was one of the first lenses that I purchased with my Rebel XT.  Now after taking several thousand pictures with it I can honestly say it was well worth the cost.  I very rarely have any unsharp pictures with this lens unless it is my own fault by trying to use too slow of a shutter speed without a tripod.

I also have the 180mm f/3.5L Macro Lens, which costs about 3 times more than this lens, and although it is very clear and the extra reach is nice at times especially since it can be used with both the 1.4X and 2X TC's, it is very difficult to use inside without a tripod.  The 60mm can be handheld if needed with very good results even if you have to bump your ISO up a little to do so.

I have also used this lens for both inside and outside portrait work with very nice results.

All-in-all, given it's small size and light weight I very rarely leave this lens behind when I go out because you never know when you might see a great macro shot

This replacement battery is half the cost of Canon's yet offers longer life.  I bought it when I first got my SD10.  When one battery runs out, the spare goes in.  The Lenmar still works great while the Canon is near end life!  I am buying two more since they are so cheap!

DO NOT buy no name batteries on ebay.  They do not last worth a darn and are basically a waste of money!  Don't do it..

I have had 5 digital point and shoot cameras all a little bigger and better than the last. This is my first SLR and I am not in the least disappointed. This camera meets or exceeded everything I expected from it. Very easy to learn, read the manual and use the web site tuturial and when the battery is charged your ready to go take pictures. I highly recommend this camera

I recently moved into the prosumer level of digital.  The Canon D30 has proven to be an awesome camera.  There maybe better (D60), but if you are serious about digital, the D30 has to be one of the best cameras for the price.  There is a slight lag between shots, but if you are not photographing speeding bullets and express trains, the time between shots is hardly a distraction

I took this with me recently to Australia and shot landscapes as well as others, and the pictures came out better than the film cameras I have used recently, plus you don't need a scanner.  This camera works great, a must have for semi-pros.  Pros, wait for the new 1D.  Pictures come out great at 11&quot;x17&quot;

This camera is amazing. Out of the 3 digital camera's under $150 I've used, this is by far the best, beating out the Kodak and the SiPix. I originally bought the SiPix, and it was junk. Don't buy the SiPix that's under $150. The Kodak for some reason didn't seem like it took as good pictures as the FinePix, but the software was a little better, being from Kodak. 

This camera can take pictures of resolution up to 2 megapixels, but I don't even use that option because the 1 megapixel pictures are so amazing. It comes with a 16MB removable memory card, so you can take around 49 pics at 1MP, around 24 at 2MP, and it takes short videos for about 30 seconds in mpeg format at a 320 x 160 resolution, or more on a lower setting. The LCD screen can easily be turned on or off to save battery power, and the 2 AA batteries it takes lasts pretty long. It has a nice, sleak design, and the software has no issues with windows XP at least. 

The only cons I could think of are that the only zoom it has is 2X digital zoom, which is pretty much useless, and I never use it, since it's the same thing as zooming in with your picture viewer on your computer. So you can consider it not having any zoom. The software for it works well, but it could be better, options wise. The filenames of the pictures will default to a number depending on its order on the memory card, so if you transfer pics to your computer more than once in a day (since it creates folders based on date), you'll have to rename each pic. But I hardly complain, since the pictures come out so incredibly well. 

I'm so happy with this camera! If you want a camera under $150, this is the one to get. Don't even waste your time with the Kodak, unless you want the one with 3X optical zoom, but that's $200. I use it for general purpose, taking pictures of freinds and such. Once in a while I take a picture of a sunset at 2MP, and that will be photo quality printed on a full page. 1MP creates crisp and clear desktop wallpaper size images, and .3MP will created good smaller images to put on websites. There's no reason to buy anything else, go with the Fuji FinePix A200!

First thing to do is to make sure which lens you are buying. The kit lens comes with Canon 20D, 30D, 300D, or XT is the lower version, non USM one. On the higher version USM ones, you will see the red color "USM" at the front of the lens.  

According to the reviews, compare with the non USM ones, optically they are the same. However, the USM motor does focus faster and much quieter. 

People complain about the build quality. Actually I feel that it is really not that bad, much better than the Canon 50mm f1.8 II. The USM auto focus performance is fast, never hunt, and much quieter than the 50mm f1.8 II. It fits nicely on the XT.

Do not compare this hundred dollar lens to other lenses cost three times or more. We have to compare apple to apple. If you know the limitations on this lens and use it wisely, the images will come out nicely. 

1. This is not the lens for indoors low light conditions. If you need to take lots of indoor pictures and the flash is not allowed, go get a different lens. (For example, I use a Canon 50mm f1.4 for this kind of situation.)

2. The distortion on 18mm is quite a bit. Avoid taking strait lines (like buildings) pictures on the edge while wide open. However, this can be easily corrected on computers.

3. Step down the aperture to F8 or F11, the resolution will be improved a lot even at the corners. 

Overall, the performance is very good for a hundred dollar lens. It is very light weight and highly portable while traveling. This fits my needs as a cheap but fast with good image quality walk around lens.

Let's be honest...  a "kit lens" that adds approximately $70 to the overall price of a camera body is not supposed to be Canon L-series quality.  Sure, you can find a better quality lens, but not for $70 you can't!

I plan to use this lens as a knock around lens that allows me to get more familiar with my camera and run off some shots.  Personally (and this is a personal preference), I find that I tend to want to be closer to subjects anyway - with the 1.6x factor on the Rebel XT, I'm in great shape with some of my other lenses.

If you don't happen to already have a super wide lens in your arsenal, and you are getting a digital EOS with the 1.6x magnification factor, then buy this lens.

Please don't let some of the other "lens snobs" sway you - a few of which are actually "posers" that snap less than 500 pix per year and spend more time looking at the technical aspects of the picture instead of its true artistic value.  I can hear them now.. "it isn't contrasty enough", "the barrel distortion is horrible at the wide end", "pin cushion is significant"...

I say BAH!!

Are these statements true... sure they are... to a degree.  But let's remember that not everyone can afford to be as picky.

Buy the lens, load the camera with a fresh battery and a blank memory card and GET OUT THERE!!  

If you find yourself shooting at the wide end often, THEN sell/give this lens to a colleague and go in search of another (higher quality) lens... very little lost.  

Enjoy yourselves and take lots of pictures...  good luck

My search for a semi pro Digicam made me do a lot of research and after I shortlisted a few models I had to find the best deal. Amazon helped me get that deal and today when I look at the performance of the camera so far.. I am amazed... The camera was bound  to be good but a special thanks to Amazon.com for helping me get one at a gr8 price

I've had this camera for about 1 1/2 years now and it's been a tried and true companion.  I've easily taken over 10,000 shots with it and produced some really exceptional photographs.  The features that really set this camera apart are the 12X zoom, the image stabilization (a must with such a large zoom), and the rotating screen (great if you want to take a picture of yourself :)).  I also love the macro mode, I've gotten some great quality close-ups.  For most situations you can just stick it in auto mode and get great results, but the different scene modes are fun to play with as well.  Performs extremely well outdoors -- wildlife, sports, landscape, beach, etc. 

My only real complaint is its performance in low-light situations.  Pictures are grainy and the camera is very slow to respond, sometimes not responding at all.  Also it can eat through batteries fairly quickly -- regular AA batteries lasted me about 2.5 hours of continuous shooting (around 200 pictures) or less if I was shooting in cold weather.  I would definately recommend rechargable batteries.

Overall I've really enjoyed this camera.  I've used and abused it and apart from low-light situations (which I was rarely in anyway) it never let me down.  Both my grandmother and my great aunt bought one within the past 6 months and they rave about it

I had viewed concert photos taken with the S2 from a number of different photographers and they absolutely took my breath away. Saw the output of other cameras in comparison and they didn't even come close.

I was using the Canon A80 prior and while I was happy with it, my first round of photos with the S2 proved to be most impressive. While you can use this as a point and shoot, this is a camera that you should spend some time learning so that you can get the most from it. And although the S3 is the latest version of the camera, I'm not sure you get that much more for the money

I'm very pleased with this small unit that has a great deal of power. It's compact, not heavy, has an adjustable power output by simply spinning the wheel on the camera to the left or right. In addition to the light output, the head can be tilted so the light can be direct or bounced, an excellent feature. Getting up and running with this unit was a breeze because I am totally "brochure reading averse." 

Twenty years ago I was a photographer with big equipment, but had given up both.  I was surprised by the control one has with such a small and relatively inexpensive unit

An excellent flash to use with my Canon 20D at a fantastic price, the Canon 580ex was an expensive option, but should I buy one in the future ? the 430ex is perfect as a slave unit.

Just returned from a trip to Hawaii and had the opportunity to put this lens to the test.  I was very pleased with the results.  This is a powerful lens, yet it is relatively light weight and not burdensome to use.  I was able to get some really amazing wild life shots of birds, zooming in from a distance with a hand held camera (Canon EOS 20D) and virtually every shot was a keeper.  The IS feature allows you to quickly zoom and compose your shot and fire it off and the image quality is excellent with sharp focus.  Usually a lens this size with this much power requires a firm grip and almost always a tripod - not so with this one.   I shot in both portrait and landscape mode and I didn't see any problems with focus, clarity or sharpness.  All the images were clean and razor sharp.  If you are looking for a long lens with the ability to bring in a distant shot without having to use tripods and other equipment, I highly recommend this lens for your arsenal.

Have used this lens from the deer stand while hunting, at sporting events (indoor and outdoor) and at concerts.  Fast focusing and great image stabilization (IS does use quite a bit more power, though).  Have not had one problem with it. Solid build and has a little heft to it.  It is a bit pricey, but I chaulk that up to it being about the best on the market.  Would recommend it to anyone looking for a top shelf lens.

This camera is really great.  I knew I liked it before, but I immediately began to appreciate this camera all the more when I ended up with a Rebel XT as a "loaner" while my 20d was in repair.

Not that the XT is a bad camera, it just doesn't really compare to the 20d.

The 20d has a nice feel to it; it is fairly large, which is great since I have somewhat large hands.  The features are great too.  And the image quality is awesome.  I don't really need to go into all of the details, as most of the other reviewers have done an excellent job.  Let me just say that it is a great camera and is worth the five stars.

The only complaint I have about the camera is that it doesn't have spot metering.  The ability to do your light metering off of a single point of interest would be great - and they did add it to the 30d.

This is a great camera.  Plenty of resolution. Excellent shot speed.  Sturdy frame.  The kit lense doesn't do the camera justice.  Buy the body separate and add a better lense.

On the bad side, I had a small glitch with the camera's firmware soon after purchase and had to return it for a fix.  It was two months before the camera was returned.  Sorry, Canon...  you lose a star for that

I mainly bought this to go on the end of the lens adapter for the S2 IS.  It does well to protect the lens, but you can't put a lens cap over it.  It ends up being easier to use without the lens cap...and quicker when taking pictures.

The pictures are very good through it

I have used this lens for over 6 months now and have over 1k shots through it.  It is as fantastic as others note herein.  The 2.8 through the focus range is really great.  Superb.  The VR function is really a neat trick.  It is super fun to play with.

The drawbacks are size and weight.  After a 1/2 hour of shooting, your arms will get tired.  Remember to be careful and hold the lens and not the camera.  This lens is definately heavy enough to bend/warp the camera body

This lens has only two "faults."  First, it is big and heavy--quality construction often yields a heavy lens.  Second, once the photographer has seen the results that this lens can produce, there is a likelihood that he or she will be unhappy with the other lenses in the camera bag.

Results first: the images are razor sharp with this zoom mounted on my Nikon D70s.  I can get shots that I never could get before because this lens is so crisp that subjects taken at a distance nevertheless can be cropped to produce an acceptable close-up image. Subjects taken at more normal distances are breathtakingly sharp--as if shot with an excellent prime lens. This is a fast lens (F/2.8 throughout its entire zoom range).  Almost more importantly, this lens has the best "Bokeh" that I have ever experienced in a lens.  "Bokeh," to the extent that I understand the concept (it is a Japanese word meaning roughly "unfocused"), is a word describing whether the out-of-focus portion of an image (i.e. a blurred background in a photo in which only the subject is in focus) has a pleasing look to it.  This lens produces wonderful, creamy Bokeh.  The sharpness and Bokeh, combined with the excellent bright color rendition of this lens, makes this one a true classic.

I have occasionally experienced minor ghosting on this lens when shooting into a very bright subject, i.e. the sun reflecting off of the ocean.  This is a normal shortfall of a zoom lens comprised of a multitude of elements, and I have sometimes experienced this.  But such occasions are rare.

The autofocusing action of this lens is very good.  Even birds at very long distances usually produce a quick, snappy autofocus lock on my Nikon D70s.  Very seldom does it "hunt" for an AF lock, and these occasions are likely due to operator error rather than the lens.  This lens also features Vibration Reduction (VR) which enables it to produce acceptable images below what an F/2.8 lens would otherwise be suitable for.  The VR really works, too, although it is by no means a panacea for dim lighting.  

This is one of Nikon's professional lenses, and the quality of construction is excellent.  The critical mount is metal, and the entire lens is built like a tank.  The lens comes with a nice squeeze-style lens cap, and a very good lens hood that can be easily reversed for storage.

The reader can see that I am extremely enamored with this lens.  The reason is that, notwithstanding its bulk and weight, this lens produces the best nature shots that I have ever managed to take, by far.

I'm surprised to see that a lot of people only give 1* to this camera! I've had it for 2 years now and i just love it! Thanks to it, I discovered I had a real passion for photography... It's very easy to use and my pictures are great! When I show them, people usually tell me " you must have an expensive camera"... and i just show them my little Canon S500 and they are surprised with the result!
I'm just loving it

I love this flash.  I just recently purchased it and have used it for 2 big events and it worked perfectly.  I still don't know everything that it is capable of doing but am still able to work it just fine without even reading the manual.
I would definitely recommend this flash.

This camera is simply amazing!  I started out with a Canon G2, and then a Canon G6, and then a Canon 20D, and now this Canon 1D Mark II N.  I debated and researched for 3 months between the 1DS Mark II, 5D, and 30D.  My decision was primarily narrowed down to the 5D and this 1D Mark II N.  Yes, I wish this camera was a full-frame and also shared the 12.8 MP like the 5D, but you know what?  It practically killed me trying to weigh the pros and cons and finally I made my decision to go with this one and I'm 110% glad that I did.  

For me, this camera is definitely THE ONE to get because the 45 point Focusing, 8.5 fps, and the 1D Pro Body/Interface/Menu/Layout, etc is what really makes this camera worth it and the deciding factor.  Trust me, if you don't know how seriously fast the 8.5 fps really is, you need to go out to your camera store and try it out before you decide.  Because of this 8.5fps alone, I'm actually able to capture a lot of shots that I normally get lucky getting with my 20D.  And with a 5D at 3fps, I just said forget it...No way.  I'm not even a professional taking pictures for a living.  This is just purely a fun hobby for me and stepping up from a 20D to this camera is out of this world.  With the phenomenal auto focusing, additional metering, it's like I'm now playing with a Bentley (with the 1D MK2 N) coming from a Mercedes C230 Hatchback (The cheapest Mercedes that people buy just because it's a Mercedes name and they don't want to spend any more money on a real Mercedes).  This camera and the photos truly almost help me take pictures like a pro.  

Also, I don't shoot action pictures all the time, and I do love portrait photography, and landscapes and printing and blowing up large sized pictures.  But even with the 1.3 crop factor, there is still a HUGE improved difference going from a 1.6 crop and you won't have vignetting problems with some lenses that you'll have on a 5D.  With this 1D MK2 N, you can still take wonderful wedding photography, landscapes, etc.  As much as I'd like to have 12.8MP like the 5D, 8MP is really all that we need these days unless you're going to blow up and print photos that are larger than 8X10's or around there.  Unless you're printing extremely large posters and whatnot, you can pretty much do everything with this camera that the 5D can.  The resolution and MP is definitely enough.  Plus, it's also invaluable to know that you have the 8.5 fps available and ready to use if you need to and you can also tone it down and use a slower fps if you need to.  The extra bonuses with this camera which I look at as a secondary positive, are the weather seals, pro-build high quality construction body, easy to use and navigate menu system, you can see the iso information in the viewfinder as well as the lcd screen at all times, dual memory card capability, you can shoot on 2 memory cards at the same time as one for backup or use 2 separate cards independently, built-in battery grip (you don't have to shell out extra for this), longer battery life than the other cameras, best customization and most options that you can set to your liking, more than the 5D or the 20D or 30D.  I could go on and on but definitely get this camera if you can afford it.  Otherwise, the 5D is also a great choice too if you need to save the money, and all you do is take landscape pictures all day long, or never will have a use for fast action or have a need to capture quick moments, and don't want the fast and most accurate focusing system that's great for ai servo.

I had a chance to compare it with a Tokina glass. Canon is better on a contrast and better on a distortion, same or even slightly worse on a sharpness, and complete looser on a build quality.
If you are ok with 12mm - get Tokina

Up Front: If you're considering this lens, stop considering  - and buy it. I had occasion to try the Tamaron Zoom in this range and noticed plastic-y digital qualities in some of the Tamaron's highlighted-texture areas. None of that is a problem with this Canon beauty. I am using it as my normal lens. The contrast is razor-sharp enough to shave with. It's graphic in monochrome and colors are pure and leap off the monitor like a politician attracted by a TV camera. It's also light weight and plenty fast enough with practically no spherical Abs....

Tiny problems include an understandable perspective bulging on subjects about the edges. And there is some blue fringing on very high contrast edges. Photoshop nails the latter dead'er than Britney Spears' career. I've had a need for reasonably large blow-ups, with most captures cropped, yet still enlarged up to prints that are minimally 13X20. At that size not only does this lens reproduce a subject's pores, but you can peer down and see the stuff inside the craters.

In the never ending race for larger and larger megapixel counts, the D70s has fallen behind the pack.  (However, if that's the only measure by which you're judging a digital camera - you really should consider further research before plunking down several hundred dollars.)  Nevertheless, it's quite a good camera.  

What I like about it most:
- It looks and feels solid.  Some of the reviewers that pan this camera for feeling flimsy and plasticky are apparently still stuck in the realm of pro cameras that cost several thousand dollars.  It's not a bulletproof titanium box that you can back a Hummer over, but it certainly seems to outdo DSLRs in it's category.  
- Very good battery life.
- Backwards compatibility with decade's worth of Nikon SLR lenses.

My gripes:
- The latch that keeps the pop-up flash in place broke in less than a week.
- Inability to meter through older manual focus lenses.
- Lack of full functionality with flashes other than the SB-600 and SB-800.  
- Nikon's RAW software and control software aren't included with the camera, and are IMHO overpriced.  (...and on top of that, Nikon has split what used to be one overpriced software package into two overpriced software packages...)

What would improve this camera the most:
- ISO 100 and ISO 3200+ 
- Ability to store multiple custom white balance presets, and then pull them up on the fly.
- Replacing the "idiot modes" (i.e. "portrait", "landscape", etc.) with modes that you could customize

I am a professional photographer, and I have owned this camera for nearly two years.  I also have a D70 for backup.  The batteries go forever, it is very quick to respond, the images are beautiful, and it has the typical Nikon durability and reliability.  If you are already a Nikon user, the controls will fall easily to hand.

That having been said, the computer software with this camera is a joke.  For the best image quality shoot RAW files, color balance with a grey card, and render the images with software like Capture One LE.  The uselessness of the included software is the only reason that this camera gets four instead of five stars.  Come on, Nikon, be real!!!

Shortly after I got my first D70, I shot a model for a small photo for a side bar in a catalog.  I got an ugly feeling in my gut when I was told that the designer had taken a shot that was 3/4 figure, cropped to the head and shoulders, and enlarged the image for the cover of the 8.5 x 11 in catalog.  By the time I found out, it was already at the printer.  As it turned out, I was pleasantly surprised: the cover shot looked great.  After that incident, I have trusted this camera and have always been pleased with the results.

This camera is better than 35 mm in every way except response to the shutter button.  In resolution and color reproduction it is more comparable to a medium format film camera.  It is imperative to shoot RAW and process the files properly to get the most out of this camera.

I can't wait to try the D80

Excellent camera kit. Versatile. I have a lot to learn about the camera, though, as it is no simple point-and-shoot. However, in Auto mode, it takes great point-and-shoot pictures. I look forward to learning how to use it fully. Lenses came with warranty cards, but the camera itself did not. I bought the SB-600 flash as well and another battery and two 1 GB compact flash cards to round out the kit. Camera with lens attached is large, which I underestimated. $80 camera bag is too small for it all. Great camera, though. Price was the best I could find anywhere

The Digital Rebel is the most amazing camera i've ever owned. My previous camera was a Canon A90 and I loved using all the features on it [great camera!]. I decided recently that maybe I should graduate to a SLR because I was starting to get more creative with my photography. I spent a great deal of time researching cameras and finally decided on the Digital Rebel. After a few months of owning it I still am amazed. The image quality is fantastic, it's quick and responsive, and every day using it I learn a little more. It's the perfect intro SLR camera for me because everything makes sense and it's easy to learn. I've gotten amazing shots that I could never dream of getting with a point and shoot. 

If you are finding yourself wanting a little more than a point and shoot, go for this camera, you wont be sorry.

I purchased this camera a year ago (summer 05).  Definitely a great upgrade over the original rebel, although the new xti has a larger screen which is the one aspect of this camera that is not perfect.  There are other sites that will perform more comprehensive reviews of this camera, but after a year mine is still working perfectly

Canon makes a great underwater housing for a reasonable price.  I purchased this for a recent trip to Grand Cayman and Cozumel.  I didn't go Scuba diving on this trip, but I did take the camera snorkeling (diving to depths ~20ft).  It worked flawlessly and I got some pictures I was very happy with!  One thing I did not anticipate was the use the camera got out of the water.  Going from AC to the hot humid outdoors, my EOS rebel fogged up (condensation) and even after 30 minutes I couldn't take good pictures.  With the SD110 in the UW housing, I just wipped the housing's glass portal with a lens tissue after it had warmed up a couple of minutes and I was able to take clear pictures. 

The instructions are pretty good, but it took me a while to figure out how to take out the O-ring seal for cleaning/lubing.  Once I figured it out, it wasn't so hard.

The SD110 may be getting a little old, but it still takes decent pictures and even with the housing I don't have so much money tied up in the system that I would be devestated if it was lost or stolen.  I will probably upgrade to the SD550 or SD500 (they both use the same batteries as the SD110) with the WP-DC80 or WP-DC70 housing at some time in the near future, but I will definitely keep the SD110 and WP-DC10 as backups

Pros:
- Reduces flare and ghosting when shooting in bright light.
- Helps protect your lens from dirt and scratches.
- Somewhat protects the lens in case of a fall.  Better to break the hood than the front element.
- Makes you look more like you know what you are doing and helps to keep others from carelessly walking in front of you.

Cons:
- Will increase lens movement in windy situations, kind of like a sail on a boat.
- Takes up more room in your bag, even when reversed they still add to the diameter of the lens.
- People take more notice of you, will help to blow your cover if you are trying to keep a low profile

Nice Quality, but overpriced.  Does a nice job of protecting the front of the lens, and reducing glare in some situations

Good basic set of inexpensive filters.  Nice case.  Great for a beginner/starting set.  If you're willing to spend more money on filters, getting B+W or Hoya will suit you better.

When I bought a digital camera, I already knew that I would need rechargeable batteries for it. What I didn't realize was how quickly the camera would eat the supplied alkalines. I had taken barely a dozen pictures before they were drained to the point where the camera would no longer operate!

So I looked for a set of rechargeable batteries and a charger and quickly settled on this one because of previous experience with Monster Cable's products.

It performs better than advertised. The initial charge may have taken 3 hours, but subsequent charges have been much quicker. I have yet to drain these batteries to the point where they won't operate the camera. The charger itself is an attractive unit for an appliance, and has an LED indicator that lights up red for charging and changes to green to indicate fully charged. It is compact enough to fit comfortably in the camera bag and the plug folds into the back of it.

I have had good service from it and can highly recommend this charger

I bought one of these for my Canon SD-800 and can recommend it.  For many years now, I've carried Canon pocket cameras on my belt while traveling and the Canon-branded cases are simply the best for this purpose.  My only criticism of the Canon cases has been their lack of a small pocket for media.  I was hoping that with the tiny size of SD cards Canon would have added such a pocket to their newer cases, but they haven't.  On the plus side, the case retains the superior leather construction, uses a neat magnetic tie down for the flap instead of Velcro or a snap, and has a belt loop that is tight enough to hold the camera comfortably against your body.  The package also includes a nice looking leather replacement strap for your camera.  Incidentally, the SD-800 is well matched to the case, fitting quite securely

Excellent case, no question about it. It is stylish and well-put together. This can not be worn on a belt, though, it must go in a pocket, purse, or in your hand. The main thing is that it keeps the awesome camera safe and sound, and it looks good doing it.

Photos were excellent. But photo print quality depends very much on the print shop. For the same photo file, it can look like a 4M photo when taken to a below quality printer shop. Photos taken indoor with marginal lighting (no flash used) turned out to be yellowish. Battery life is very long despite its large 3" LCD. Battery charging time is over 3 hours - too long. Photos files viewed on computer looks just great. 8'x10' prints are great but have not tried larger prints. Touch screeen control is a delight and very easy to choose and set. Date on photo is red (would be better if it is black). And the location of the date is not at the far right hand corner

I've had my D70s for about a year now, haven't regretted it for a second. 

The controls are laid out logically, with everything to hand. The dual control wheels make adjustments fast and accurate. I personally love the optional grid overlay, I have no excuses for horizons that aren't horizontal. The wireless flash system is great, though you have to buy an SB-600 or SB-800 to get the full benefit. This camera is bigger and heavier than the D50 and D80, which in my opinion is a positive thing.

I do weddings, portrait, and outdoor photography and I don't see any reason why I'd ever switch from the D70 (other than the D80 :).  This camera is professional grade at the consumer price point.  Don't be scared by the 6.1 MP.  I print at 20x30 all the time w/ out any problems.  I'd recommend reading Thom Hogans manual

This UV filter does it job to protect the lens well. The build is solid (metal construction). The glass is also descent quality. 

About the performance, it absorbs some UV light. The UV light absorbtion is hardly noticeable, probably the sky 1-A and the haze filter version will absorb more UV light than this lens which is fine for me. 

Now, about the one problem which is the internal reflection. I've heard many people say that it mostly happens during night or low light shooting. I found out that it is not caused directly by the low light/night situation. The internal reflection will appear when there is a strong/bright source of light in comparison to the overall exposure (the surrounding environment). To put it in example (which hopefully is easier to understand), when you take a picture of a lamp during nightime and the light is much brighter than the surrounding area then you will see the internal reflection. as you move the position of the light to be closer to the sides/corner of the picture (and not in the center of the picture), the internal reflection reduces and finally dissapear (if you move the light far enough from the center). And if the light isn't too bright/contrast compare to the surrounding environment then there will be no internal reflection. but of course most of the time, a lamp at nightime is often very bright. But the point that I'm trying to make is that the internal reflection doesn't happen all the time during low light or night time. 

Additionally, the internal reflection isn't only happening at night. it can also happen in the afternoon if you are taking a picture of a sun for example. basically same rule as above, on how bright is the light source compared to the surrounding area, and as you move the sun from the center of the photo and near the side the internal reflection will move to the side/dissapear (also depending the angle). But the best way is just to remove the filter during these situations. 

Hope this explanation helps you to reduce the occurence of internal reflection by identifying correctly when the internal reflection will occur and then remove the filter during those situation (which is not hard to do). 

I'm actually not a fan of lens filter (any filter) as I think it will only degrade picture quality as we added another layer between the sensor and object, but I decided to use them anyway for all my lens. And I would recommend everyone to get one of this filter if you don't have any filter for your lens yet. 

I use this filter on my 50mm f/1.8D lens and on my 18-55mm lens.

If you are looking for a great all around camera, this is it!  Our kids play sports and are in constant motion and the sports mode captures it all.  Also love the "Last 4" feature, gets some great action shots.  We had the Fuji 7000 before this and they have definately fixed the features that bugged me.  Love the new manual zoom (if you like 35mm lenses your like this) as well as the battery drain.  I used to have to replace batteries every day, now its more like once a week with the amount we use it.  My other favorite feature is the dual memory slots for those times where I forget to put it back in the camera after downloading!  So there is always one in there!.  The video comes out great and with the new manual lens you can zoom during video shots.  In general, without spending A LOT MORE, you get a great camera that keeps up with an active "picture happy" family

I'm using it for a few months now; I haven't found a single problem so far. Earlier, I was using an old FinePix and the optic/sensor sensitivity was not very good; poor quality of photos taken in dark environment. This is not a problem any more. Also, I was impressed with the sharpness of photos of sport actions taken with 10x zoom. In general, I was pretty enthusiastic about all the features of this camera; it took me nearly 3 days to try everything out :-). Sure, there are better cameras on the market; however, considering the price it is just a great deal

The quality is definitely great. When attached to the S3 IS, it makes your camera look serious about taking good shots. If you are attaching the hood and doing flash photography, I suggest you use a slave flash to eliminate the shadow caused by the hood

I use my Canon 10d mainly for Astrophotography. Most of the time, 
it involves keeping the camera shutter open for long periods of 
time, anywhere from a few minutes to tens of minutes. This ACK-E2
adapter takes my worries away from monitoring battery status or a 
drained one, while i control the camera remotely sitting inside my 
house. Continuous power also ensures worry free writes to its flash
storage. The package included several AC power connectors which is 
very useful while travelling. Amazon provides a wide range of items 
to choose from.

I bought this lens on a whim to see what it would be like to shoot with a prime lens. At $80 it certainly was worth the risk unlike the many other Canon lenses which cost thousands of dollars. The quality of the pictures from this lens is the only thing making me move away from zoom lenses

This is a fabulous and reliable camera. Feels solid. Fantastic pictures. Easy to operate. A new D40 has been announced over the past few days, but its lack of an LCD display and buttons to manage basic camera controls (to reduce weight and make it more user friendly) would still make this my recommended Nikon DSLR. Expect prices to fall as the D40 becomes available

I am not a photographer, but I enjoy taking good pictures. I never had a digital SLR before; the camera I had before the D50 was a Nikon Coolpix (a compact one). I thought this would have been a good camera for someone who enjoys good pictures without being a pro. I realized that it was even better than what I expected (maybe because I was coming from a Nikon Coolpix). The colors are amazing and the quality of the picture is extremely good.
The D50 is among the cheapest digital SLR's, and, at the same time, it is a very serious product. I don't think the D50 is much inferior to the Canon Rebel, even if the Canon has 2 more megapixels of resolution. I used both the D50 (which I own) and the Rebel (at my school) and I think the D50 feels much more like a "pro camera" when you hold it in your hands, while the Rebel feels more like a toy.
The lenses provided in the package are good, but are basic. According to me the 18-55 is better than the 28-80, but I think I should have bought the 55-200 as well: 18 to 200 covers most of the pictures that you can take. Also the 18-135 that Nikon sells with the D80 looks good to me, but they don't make a kit with those lenses for the D50.

The last thing that really amazes me is the .NEF format (Nikon's RAW format). It is impressive how quickly you can improve a .NEF picture with your computer in just very few clicks of mouse.

If you want a good camera, and you don't want to spend too much money for it I think this is the best choice

I purchased this at a photographic store because a professional said you shouldn't go higher than 1.4x.  Just keep in mind--1.4x is only "40% better".  It worked really well, but didn't increase the zoomage enough.  I decided to go with a 2x (that's twice the zoomage) teleconverter by kenko instead.  I gave this one to my brother-in-law for Christmas.

You have to think about what you want--I want to get in really close to the birds.  I have a 70-300mm zoom lens and 1.4x takes it to 98-420mm.  It is an improvement, but not nearly enough!  If you want to get twice as close, this isn't going to do it for you.  If you want to get half-again-as close, this almost gets you there.  

As far as quality, the quality is definitely there. Five stars for quality, 3 for insufficient zoomage

My first digicam, bought it 2 years ago. 
Simple to use, great pictures, and a year ago (and hundreds of pictures ago) I dropped it (no in its case) on a cobblestone road - no damage.
Have never seen the need to replace it.
I like the common batteries it uses and the SD memory

Aside form the fact that Canon charges an arm and a leg for a 1 dollar piece of plastic, the remote switch does work well.  It does not feel very sturdy and does not seem nearly as well built as the Canon cameras.  People with big hands may have a little trouble using this product.  Overall, a "must have" addition for anyone interested in long exposures, images with excellent sharpness and depth of field

It is simple, handy and works well to prevent shaking your camera. But I am still doubt if this simple accessory really deserves 50 bucks... This wired release would be the choice only if you are not a Digital Rebel user who has a more reasonable price option for the additional shutter button.

I honestly don't see why people would give this camera less than 4 stars. The moment I got it, I was delighted with the quality of the pictures (except in very dark places - which is why the review gets minus 1 star), and by its portability.

I've dropped it, abused it, took it to countless parties, countries and it is now FULL of scratches and bumps (GET THE CAMERA CASE!), and guess what: it still works as perfectly as the first day I got it. This little piece of technology is amazing, so if you're looking for something affordable and with a great picture quality (for us amateurs, of course) just go for it. ACtually, I even took quite a few gorgeous pictures with it. I even love it and rely on it so much that I won't change it even now that it looks all messed up.

Don't think twice. Just go for it

Had looked at this lens both at the camera shop and on line and finally decided after much comparison with other lenses to finally purchase it, have'nt regretted it one bit. This lens is clear with excellent color, saturation and sharpness without any or minimal post processing. Coupled with an external flash it's great indoors as well. Have been using it as my everyday walk around lens. Zoom range is excellent(Rebel XT/XTi 1.6 magnification). Though it's somewhat on the big side, it won't tire you out carrying it around your neck. Purchased the hood seperately which, for the money should have came with the lens. 
Anyway, this lens offers excellent value for the money and you won't regret the investment

This is the first IS lens that I've owned. I had trouble justifying the extra expense but am now quite pleased that I took the step up. 

Keep in mind that tis is an EF not EF-S lens. This makes its effective focal length about 45-215mm on my Digital Rebel.

I love the zoom range (great for shooting action shots of kids without getting in their faces) and the ability to easily control the depth of field on my nature shots.

Just uploaded some of my recent shots with this lens under "Share your own customer images".

From all the reviews I read, I expected certain pros and cons from this lens.  I was not disappointed.
pros:  very sharp lens with very good colors
cons:  vignetting at wide open, and a little too contrasty
For myself, the pros outweighed the cons for the price.  It is ideal for the 1.6 multiplier cameras, where it becomes a 38mm lens

This kit is a must have for any of the compatible Canon cameras. Digital camera rule #1: ALWAYS carry a spare battery - the kit is almost worth it for  that alone. The leather case is great: stylish looks that provides a tough protective armor in case you drop the camera. The neck strap is quite strong and looks good too. It may not be everyone's cup of tea but I like it. It comes in handy when I need quick access to the camera and don't want to fumble through pockets or bags

I've had my D2H for 9 months now. I've heard of the magenta skin tones issue but have never seen it..skin tones on my unit are great. It seems this issue plagued a minority of users.

Camera is very fast, exposes well and delivers results. It's primarily designed to be a sports and Photojournalism camera -- for situations where speed counts. It's a 4 megapixel wonder -- it's true it only has 4 megapixels, but they are 4 GREAT megapixels. Images upsize wonderfully. 

I love my unit, and am debating whether to buy a second one as a backup, or wait for the D2X. The price of the D2x is making that decision a bit easier and I'm leaning toward another D2H.

I have had my Canon Eos 30D for about a week and after 500 shutter actuations I am completely addicted to photography.  I bought the 17-85mm Canon lens and it takes phenomenal pics especially using the software and post-processing in RAW.  I also have a 70-300mm lens for sports/outdoors/nature and bursts of 5fps are a beautiful sound.  I bought the Camera through Dell and with rebates currently this is the best deal out there!  Strongly recommend.  Pay the extra $$$ and get this over the Rebel XTI.  You won't be disappointed

I upgraded from the Canon Digital Rebel (grey body) to this because I was ready to take my photography to a new level. One thing I like most about this camera is it's flash compenstation. I purchased the 430ex flash with it because I was tired of having to use the built in flash and always getting those hard shadows on the wall

The Philips Digital Frame truly stands out from all other digital pictures frames that I've gotten.  The resolution and picture quality superb, and the sleek outer design is an additional plus.  Also, the picture frame can be charged and last a couple of hours without a cord, which is very convenient. 

As another reviewer said, you have to scroll through your entire collection one-by-one on your memory card in order for you to get to the picture you want.  It would be more convenient if you could skip through pages or have a BlackBerry type rolling scroll on the side of the frame to speed through if you needed to.  

Also, I would like to see Philips next frame include a flashdrive slot as well, that way we can upload pictures from our computers to the USB flash drive and directly insert the flash drive into the frame without tranferring them onto a memory card. 

Thank you

It's well designed, the protection is very good, but you should know it's pretty compact, you can put only the camera inside, nothing else.

Also take care about the color, it has some pink on it, if you are a relly macho and worry about it, better look for options

What's not to like? Light, compact and comes with the strap, case and wipe cloth.  They are perfect.  Keep in mind 12 power can be more challeging to hold still

I am very happy with the resulting prints from this camera.  I've used other brands in the past and never have had such bright colors and in focus shots.  The winding mechanism is easy to use.  Finally I have pictures of my diving expeditions to remember.

It's even suited for kids over ten to use.  Mine had lots of fun with their own Quick Snap

  This camera is perfect for me I have a [...] an a [...] an it always seems there doing something ide like to catch on film. This camcorder is small enough that some days I have it in my jacket pocket an the instant on makes it really easy to catch them moments that are usually gone by the time you get them big cameras out of the bag an ready to go. Also it can extract a still picture out of a video clip so them candid shots are never missed. 
  The settings for this camera are really easy to understand an use.
  It takes really good video's an pictures although Ive not taken alot of still pictures because I like to extract that perfect picture out of a video clip. This camera takes video cards so your not always downloading onto your pc. Ive got a few 2 gig cards so ive always have one in the camera ready to go. 
  The battery does not last a long time so I recommend a couple extra, there pretty cheep here on Amazon an it usually takes one battery to download onto pc if you have it hooked up to your PC for any lengh of time. 
  I dont know anything about camera's an how they work I just like to take the pictures an so far this has been the easiest camera /camcorder ive seen

I received the XACTi a few weeks ago and it's performing like I hoped it would.  The controls are a very simple and intuitive.  All the required hardware is included.  Does not require any additional software to run on Mac or Windows.

I have a MacBook with Boot Camp running Windows XP Pro.  The camera works easily with either platform.  It is recognized as another drive and does not require any additional software to download the images and movies onto the hardrive.  I am using a SanDisk 2gb SD memory card.

Another big plus is not having to wait while downloading real-time like you would have to with miniDV.  The quality may not be the same as miniDV but the convenience and ease of use make up for the difference.  The quality is much better than a digital camera when taking movies and people will think it's just a camera by it's small size.

My old camera was a 2 mega pixel Canon Powershot A60.  This is rated at 6 mega pixel.  You can definitely see the difference in the pictures and movies.  When filming movies, the higher frames per second sample rate makes the images smooth, even when taking pictures of high speed objects like helicopter rotor blades and airplane propellers.

This is my first camcorder so I can't really compare to anything else (except my old camera) but the ease of use will make you want to use it all the time and people will start to tell you to put that thing away

I going to write the for non techs out there...

I can use it, my wife can use it, my mom can use it and my 5 year old son can use it. It is just that simple to use. You do not need to know anything about taking shots, other than how to zoom and pick the right settings, and if you play with the camera for a few days you will know them.
One other reviewer said to get the following:
1. At least a 512 MB Memory Stick Pro Duo to take 160 or so pictures in one go
2. Rechargeable AA batteries and a charger
3. Case

and i must say YES, YES and YES... to all, they are a must...

This camera, feels good in your hands, screen size is great. You can see the screen in both sunlight and at nights.
The menu is very easy to follow and the quality of the picture are clean and clear.
i can't comment on the software that comes with the camera as i have a Apple computer and i use iPhoto.
For the price, i felt like i got a $[...] Sony...

I'm a former 35mm photographer who's a little older and not as spry as I once was and I eventually got out of the habit of lugging a case of equipment everywhere I went.  I got re-energized in photography with digital but a small compact point and shoot left me wanting more.  Digital SLR's are pricey and as a friend pointed out I'd be back to lugging a case of equipment around me with her.  She recommended this model and the more I looked at it the more I liked it. 
It is a fixed lens model, but with a 12:1 optical zoom what other lenses would really need.  It start up fast, zooms and focuses internally so there is no moving barrel to have to hold on to.  It has just about every feature an advanced amateur could want.  It does macro.  And it has an optical stablization system that works as advertised.  
So far I haven't come across anything that it can't do.  This is a nice unit for an advanced amateur or even semi-pro who doesn't want to go full digital SLR yet.

I am only an amateur photographer, but still . . . this small camera with the long nose gives performance one might expect from an SLR film camer costing a lot more, and a lot more complicated to use. I caught the digital bug sevearl years ago. My latest before this beauty was a simple little Canon SureShot 3mp. A great camera, but this camera has the same simplicity, but takes pictures which are much more refined in terms of sharpeness for not much more than I paid for that camera four years ago!! This Panasonic Lumix has a Leica Lens, which can' t be matched by any other camera but it's twin Leica camera--a much more expensive piece of equipment. The long lens might put you off if you are an average family photog, but if you want an all around 35mm-12X camera without a huge heavy expensive bag of lenses, like me, this baby is for you. It only looks massive. It is quite lite and manageable. I use it for bird photographsy, but it could be great for any situation where you need to get really close up in just about any lighting situation with ultra-fine resolution. Don't want to spend mega bucks for a mega-camera? This is the answer. I love it, and I think your will, too. Easy to use, and easy on the wallet. If you're not quite there, try the next model down, with the same focal length but 6 mp, for a couple hundred less. Another terrific buy. No, I don't work for Panasanic. I'm a retired print editor.

Unlike many reviewers I am not diver.  I bought this to for the peace of mind that my camera wouldn't get ruined taking pictures of my son at the water park, pool, and beach.  This equipment exceeded my expectations with always clear photo and underwater flash.

This case has out lived an S400 and S500.

Well worth the $170 price tag

Being in Hawaii, I spend plenty of time in the water...so having an underwater housing for my camera is almost a necessity.  I have been very happy with the results, shooting in the water (snorkeling, etc) and above the water (surf footage-just watch out for water spots on the lens).  Some of my photos are up for view in other parts of the page for this housing.

I treat things pretty roughly, and have been using this for about a year with no problems.  And I am in the water with it on an almost daily basis.  I like being able to use all the features of the camera (minus downloading images or changing the battery or CF card) while the camera is in the housing-something you cannot always say when looking at aftermarket housings that are non-Canon manufactured.  Everything mates up cleanly and works great, I am very happy with my purchase.

Just remember to rinse it off/soak it in freshwater after taking it in the ocean or the pool to keep the corrosion at bay, and put a little light silicone grease on the o-ring for trouble free use

I just bought this waterproof case in order to use my Canon s410 on a scuba diving trip.  I was a little nervous at first (I could see me scrapping the camera after it got soaked to the bone!), but I have to say that the waterproof case performed admirably!  I used it on 6 dives, and all of them were to depths of 80+ feet.  I did not have one leak!  A word of caution--I followed instructions and coated the seal of the camera with a fine coat of silicon gel (just a small amount).  I would like to think that the camera would not leak without this, but I did not want to take any chances.

I would recommend this case to anyone who wants to use their Canon camera on dive trips or excursions at the beach

300 plus minutes of recording time (without LCD). I still got several hours with the LCD, backlight on.

For when you are out all day, this is a good long lasting battery.

On the HDR-FX1 I found it preferable to the smaller and lighter battery as it helped provide a touch extra rear weighting. That helped balance when using the camcorder at hip height for me. I can't say I noticed the extra weight as an issue when using at shoulder height, though I didn't have it on my shoulder for long periods at a time

Bought this camera to replace my 35mm camera.  Am pleased with the trade up that I made.

The shape is similar to my old film camera.  Thought this would make it easier to adjust to the smaller size of it.  It has made the transition relatively smooth.  I'm sure there are smaller cameras out there, but this one is small enough.  The display is also a good size - bigger than most that I looked at.

I am not a genius at computers, so I was concerned that I would need to adapt to downloading pictures from the camera to the PC.  But, all I need to do is plug in the cord and click a button.  Very easy to follow any instructions.

I did notice that the display "freezes" for a second or two after a picture is taken.  This is not generally a problem for me as most pictures are posed shots.  I did run into some lag time during an Easter egg hunt this past weekend, but still managed to get about a dozen good shots.

Overall, I like the camera and only wish I had gotten up the courage to go digital sooner

I bought my Canon A540 recently from Amazon and am completely satisfied. I added a 1Gb SD card for $11 from Ebay and a charger with 4 2500NiMH AA batteries from the supermarket.  The images are clear and large. You have the options of full automatic, various manual settings up to full manual and a wide selection of preprogrammed modes.  

At work we needed a new camera to record tiny scratches and imperfections in our manufactured product, so I took my camera in to demo. Using the standard lens (a macro lens is available but I don't have it yet) we photographed a quarter using only ambient light. In less than a minute we had the image on the screen and were able to blow it up until the date filled the screen and still maintain good detail.  As a result we are now buying one for work with a macro accessory lens.

I totally recommend it as an excellent all rounder

When I purchased this camera I was really conflicted on wheather I should get a digital still camera or a digital video camera.  So when I decided still and found out the Canon PowerShot had a video feature, I was pleased but had very low expectations.  BOY WAS I SUPRISED!  This camera has so many fun features for both still and video pics.  And the quality is awesome for both!  There is a video email option so you don't have to guess if your videos are going to fit into an email.  But if you want you can create some really good quality video with a quick adjustment.  And all of it transfers easily to my computer.

Plus with still pics there are lots of easy features to choose from so you can quickly set up for any kind of shooting sinario.

I purchased this camera for shooting product photos for our website. I had been using a Nikon Coolpix at 5mp and wanted something relatively low cost with higher mp for the next few years. We plan to purchase something totally outlandish in a few years for super-quality printed photos, but for now, this camera is an excellent investment. Easy and small enough for everyone in the company to carry on trips abroad, but inexpensive enough to not break our hearts if pocket-picked or eaten by a hyena.

I've read some reviews that talk about blurred photos...I'm really surprised. I began using ours after I had my son, so many photos were taken without a tripod, one hand holding a nursing child and the other shooting photos...and none of the images turned out blurry. I have taken a few photos of my son now that he's a six-month-old super action hero that look like cotton candy on my Nikon but turn out crystal clear on the Sony. 

The movie mode is a real plus. I'm actually on this page today because I'm looking to buy one of these for my personal use with video recording in mind. We have a digital video camera, but with plenty of 1G memory cards in hand, I'd rather record action with this camera--the quality and sound are worlds better.

This is a lovely little low-cost camera that's suitable for a wide range of users.  I love it

Good camera for the $129 I paid. Does everything pretty well, and your picture modes are pretty customizable. Only qualm is it takes a second or two longer than I wish when the camera saves/loads pictures to the memory card. Might be a problem when trying to shoot consecutive pictures-- but probably wouldn't be doing it with this type of camera anyways.

We canoe/kayak down various rivers and creeks.  I wanted a way to take my $1500 camera on the water without fear of damaging it.  

The Sports Pack is completely water proof (up to 7m).  I've submersed the case in a test and in a real-life situation and the camera stayed dry.  

The case does not cause any noticeable reduction in picture quality. It is relatively simple to operate and assemble. You have only the basic functions of the camera while in the case, so you need to change any setting for the camera before putting it in the case and advanced camera features are not able to be used.

My only concern is the scratch resistance of the plastic over the lens area.  So far I haven't had any problems but I've only taken on the river for about 30 hrs.

All told, I'm very pleased and if you plan on filming in or near water I would recommend this case

It is rated for 5 meters but I took it to 9 and there were no sings of moisture or a single drop. The antifogging solution provided works for more than an hour. The microphone records sound well. I have a High Def cam and the S.Pack did not decrease image quality inside or outside the water. In the specs it is stated that its buoyancy is positive, and by experience I recomend to buy a weight for it to avoid the camera going up in the water while you push and push down - even more snorkeling. There are special weights that are mounted to the enclosure using the trypod whole. I would say a 14-18 onz it fine.
It is a great item

For its size and price, this little light can't be beat. Very transportable and produces a dramatic influence on the image quality of evening shoots indoors. I think this is a must have for camcorder owners. My VHS family movies shot over 20 years ago are still a source of pure joy, so I see this as a miniscule investment for the long-term return.

In short, I love it. 
The XH A1 is a professional looking camera and has all the features you need.
It is a bit complex for those who are not true prosumers or pros, and the manual is not consumer oriented.

The picture qualitity is, so far, the best I've seen in non-pro cameras. The 3 CCDs at 1/3 inch each are truely spectacular. 


The 2 external XLR connections are the reason I looked at this camera. If you want to mic someone via wireless or wired lav mic, this is the camer to do that. Just make sure you read over the XLR connection settings in the manual a few times and change the buttons (unfortunately located in 4 different locations on the camera) to the right settings. A set of good headphones is a must-have when not using the wonderful built-in mic. By the way, this built-in mic eliminated one of the situations where I always needed a mic, a close up interview situation--the built-in is very sensitive and accurate for this type of thing.

The downside to this camera is really only that it does NOT contain an HDMI adapter. Sadly CANON did not provide one; instead they opted for a custom (HDMI-looking) adpater that if you loose the cable you can't run down to Fry's or Radio Shack to get another one. :(

The other thing is that it is 1440x1080 instead of 1920x1080.  Their new CANON HV20 ( a 1CCD camera due in April 2007) is 1920x1080 resolution--just seems odd to me.  But then I'm the guy that will get a 10 Megapixel camera simply because its better resolution. :)

The bottom line, don't get the Sony FX7, get this one. The Sony seems and is easier to use, but it doesn't have an external XLR jack, it uses 1/4 inch CCDs, and in a side-by-side test doesn't offer as good performance in low light situations as this one.

The camera is a bit complicated, but if you're willing to learn, it is a wonderful tool.
If you need true point and shoot, I'd wait and get the CANON HV20

I looked at this camera the Panasonic hvx200, the sonys, the jvc 200, and even Canon's bigger brother the X1. I found this one to have fantastic reviews on DVinfo.net, a great video forum. My concerns about 24f vs 24p were addressed to my satisfaction- there really isn't a difference. I like tape vs the HVX's expensive storage solutions. One concern I had was, will it look like a pro camera? That is important in some situations where your equipment gives you added credibilty with clients and talent. 

As soon as I opened the box I was in love! This is a really substantial camera. Especially with the opt wide angle from Canon and the matte box provided, this does not look like your mama's camcorder.

I really like the manual controls, so that you don't have to go thru menus to change parameters. The layout of everything is great. I really like the dual on/off and zoom controls- top of handle plus rear right side. Holding the handle for low or medium height shots is very, very comfortable and the controls are perfectly positioned. 

Only down side- and it is incidental. The matte box is a bit flimsy- lightweight plastic. That helps with weight, but I worry about breaking it. Some may say that HDV codec is not as good as DVCpro, but my eye does not see it. The colors are magnificent and it blows away many other cams in low-light.

If you are looking for point and shoot, this is not your baby, but if you want a pro quality camera for a really great price- this is it

I don't like pink so I bought the blue bag.  I had bought a black one, but it was so skimpy I returned it and prayed until this one arrived. I had no trouble with Amazon crediting me for the return, either.  It was so cute!  I'm too old for "cute," but I kept it because I needed a case for my new HP R717.  It is small, yet padded enough to trust that your camera will be cushioned if you drop it.  I have dropped my camera and it was not injured.  It has a little pouch inside to store an extra battery for my camera, not the big AA batteries, but the flat type that come with my R717.  I recommend this little bag, or the pink one, even if you don't like pink...or blue.  They are well cushioned and snug, but not too snug you think they will tear.  The are sturdy and have nice shoulder straps and magnet closures

I bought this for my new HDV FX1 Camcorder, and it works great.  Unlike the Century wide-angle lens, this is fully zoom-through.  Lens is .8x, which is less than the Century and others, but just about right for HD--since the FX1 already can do a pretty decent wide shot when the zoom is fully backed out, this just gives it an extra boost, converting the camera view from roughly a 35mm lens on a 35mm camera to about a 28mm.  Also, very little barrel distortion.

In all a great lens.  Only drawback is that it's a big (heavy) lens, but then, hey, it's for a serious prosumer camcorder

I recently purchased this camera.  It arrived one day before I was due to fly out to Palm Springs.  I took lots of pictures with this camera and was pleased with all of them except the night time pictures.  This may or may not be because I am a novice photographer. Even with the night time setting my pictures came out blurry, but all others came out better than I ever expected.  I think once I play around with it, my night time pictures will improve, but straight out the box this was kinda disappointing to me.  No regrets with this purchase though.  Also, buy a larger memory stick.  The one that comes with the camera only stored 6 pictures and I had to run out and buy another.

I purchased this camera so I could photograph wildlife on hikes.  I needed something that was not too heavy, was image-stabilized, with telephoto power.  This camera meets all those requirements.  It does have one problem, however.  In bright light, the viewfinder blanks out, so one cannot clearly see the object to be photographed.  I have solved that problem to some extent, by pointing the camera at the object, and letting the autofocus do the rest.  This "fix" has resulted in many excellent photos.  Like many other small cameras, the results tend to be contrasty, and I modify this tendency in photoshop

I love my new Canon A710.  Large LCD makes taking pictures easy to frame, color and sharpness is good all around and needing only 2 AA batteries is great.  I no longer need to search and buy special camera batteries, I can go into any drug store.

Only draw back on this camera is the size of the memory card 16mb.  For a few bucks more put in at least a 1Gig.

Overall rating for a camera in this price range - above average

Overall, I am quite satisfied with the usability and photo quality of the Canon A 710 IS.  This camera was an upgrade from my 3-year-old HP 935 -- the old guy still worked fine, but was very slow and didn't handle low-light situations very well at all.  I was also looking for a bigger zoom range.  After weighing the options, I decided that the A 710 IS was the way to go.  

Pros:
- Uses standard AA batteries.  Invaluable when you're on the go and need more juice.  Also, the battery life has been very good - I'm using the same AA rechargables I used for over a year in my old camera, and I routinely get 2-4 days usage from them before needing to recharge. 

- Huge LCD screen that doesn't suck power.  Fast response, too.

- Digital zoom that actually helps!  Because the camera is 7.1 MP and has an image stabilizer, I can actually get usable images even at the full 24x combined zoom.  Very impressed.

- Very wide range of available settings.  You can customize almost any aspect of this camera, from sounds to shutter speed to flash speed/brightness to focus to....

- Big enough, and small enough.  It will fit in my back pocket most of the time, but it's big enough to remind me that it's there before I sit down.  

- Fast processing time.  Taking a 3 or 4 minute video and having it ready to go again in less than 5 seconds is a true novelty to me -- my old HP took forever!  The fast processor also helps in viewing the images on the camera - you can scroll through very quickly, and also jump to an image very quickly too.  Much better than previous Canon models even.

- Memory backup battery.  Remembers what day it is, time it is, and what image you're on -- even if you take the regular AA's out.  Very useful.

- Fast start-up time.  It's ready to take a picture right after you turn it on, especially if you bypass the "welcome" image sound and screen.

- Cool features, like color swap and color select.  Also, there's an option for when the camera is connected to your computer to set any image as your computer's wallpaper with just the press of a button on the camera.  The camera also allows you to use the digital zoom while taking video, a nice touch.

- You can change lenses and add filters very easily.


Cons:
- As I mentioned earlier, one of the reasons I upgraded from the HP was to have better luck with low-light situations.  I've had the camera now for just over a month, and I still haven't figured out the best setting for clear, low-light photos -- something that was very easy to do with older Canon models, say, the A 510.  As mentioned, there is a wide range of settings available, which can also be a negative if you don't know quite what you're looking for.

- No "action" setting.  Similar to above, the one setting I miss the most from other Canons is that action setting.  This camera requires you to set it manually.

- Video file sizes.  A typical 4-minute clip can run upwards of 200 MB -- making it almost impossible to send via email or upload anywhere online.  Also takes up a good chunk of a 1MB memory card, really quickly.  Canon would have done better to use MPEG-4 here instead of AVI.  

- Similarly, the video quality doesn't reflect the large file size in most cases, though the sound quality is very good.

- The big LCD is great, but is very hard to see outside in the sun.  It does have a backup optical viewfinder, but using that puts your nose up against that LCD and leaves a nice smudge on it if you're not careful.

- Buttons are still somewhat confusing after a month of use, but that's relatively minor and will undoubtedly pass with time.  

- Bundled software does not offer the ability to resize your images -- I have to go back through the old HP software if I want to take an image down from 3000 pixels wide to 600!  



Overall, as mentioned, the camera is a huge improvement from my old HP, and even with all of those little annoyances, I'm sure the camera would be a perfect fit for pretty much any amateur-to-intermediate photog.  It's no SLR, but it's getting there.  And, you certainly can't beat the price

For years now I have been buying "bargain" cameras with the foolish notion that I did not need a nice one. Finally, I got sick of it and bought the Exilim EX-Z600. This camera is awesome. The screen is huge, the picture quality is great, it is easy to use and is sooo small. Overall, a great buy.

The one downside is that I can only connect it to my computer using the dock. Luckily, I have an SD card reader, so I normally just use that to download my pictures

After a week of testing this camcorder, I found it good enough for daily use.  The HD2 does not come with an SD card, so make sure you buy one before or at the time you get the HD2.  I got a 2GB SD A-DATA and a 4GB SDHC QPI Class6.  Both worked fine.  The 4GB gives me about 1:20h in StandardHD mode, and 55mns in SuperHD mode.  I didn't notice a speed difference between a Class2 and a Class6 SD card using the HD2, I think you should be fine with an 8GB SDHC class2.
My first impression of the camera is how small it is, however it may not fit in a jean pocket.  It turns on very quick, you can start filming within 2secs of startup.  It has a lady voice telling the mode you are using (ie camera mode), not sure if this is useful for others, but not for me.
The video and still pictures are great outdoor.  The video quality is impressive during a bright sunlight.  In a room lighten by a 60W equivalent fluo light, the video quality is grainy/noisy, this has been confirmed by other people as well.  The High Sensitivity feature (to boost the image quality at low light) helps but not enough.  My 7yrs old Sony DIgital8 does a better job at 1lux.  I noticed that video quality is grainy at low light, but 7MP still picture quality is very good for the same lighting.  Compared to my new Canon SD800 at 7MP, it is obvious the Canon Digital Camera wins.  On the video side, I played with several configuration, ISO setting, white balance, resolution, etc... It does helps, but the video is still grainy at low light.  This camcorder has not been designed for low light filming.  
I ran into an issue when transfering the video & Pictures from the HD2 with its cradle to the PC via USB connection.  I got errors transfering the files if you use the craddle (this will freeze the HD2).  I am not sure why, I have to check with Sanyo on this.  If you connect the HD2 directly to the PC (without the cradle), the transfer goes smooth.  So there is an issue with the cradle and USB port.
I am also using Pinnacle Studio 10.5 for my video editing.  So far, I have not been able to use it and control my HD2.  You can however copy the files from SD to your PC, and use these files with Pinnacle Studio.
Since I film most of the time outdoor during daytime, this camera does the job fine and video quality is great.  I would still give a 5 stars even with the video issues at low light.

The ZR500 and other low-end Canon camcorders appear to be very fine products, well worth their price -- but if what you want is the simplest and easiest way to make perfectly acceptable amateur-level home videos, have a look at the RCA Small Wonder.  

Simple, rugged, totally easy to learn and operate, no frills but still some very neat features, takes perfectly adequate videos of your children, your dog, whatever -- and about half the price.  Bought one; totally satisfied

This case was well thought out for snorkeling/diving and using your own digital camera without going to the expense of a really expensive camera.  Definitely a better choice than using those throw-away underwater cameras or renting one.  
The only drawback is that it triples the size of the great 720SW camera - since size is one of its strongpoint

I bought this camera to take pictures of my family and friends. I have had if for more than one year, and it has performed above expectations under all conditions. The 1 minute video feature is great, and was an unexpected bonus (since I didn't know about it when I bought it off Amazon). 

The camera works great with iPhoto and MacOS X. I bought a 512 MB card for it and so far it has been great. Both my father and my father in law have the previous Powershot S400 and they have had no problems with it. I figure at some point I'll have to change the battery, because Lithium-Ions lose 20% capacity per year, but so far it has worked flawlessly.

I am not a professional photographer. I just happen to be a grandson of one. I use a fully manual Canon TX SLR for my work. So far I've shot 5 rolls of this stuff. Every time there has been something wrong with the camera/me/lighting. Every time I got a usable, and sometimes, great print. This film has a huge exposure latitute (you can really screw up and still get an image) When I show these prints to others, they look at me funny and say, &quot;This is ISO 400?&quot; It has REALLY fine grain. And because it's ISO 400, you can use it for almost anything (I got usable prints after shooting a soccer game: My camera was set at ISO 100 and there were light leaks in the camera door). It's a great film, although I'm told the Royal Gold it replaces is still better. Pick up a pack of this and see what you get. You'll be amazed

This camera does everything it says; yes, it's waterproof and I was very uneasy taking a digital camera into the water for the first time!!  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars:  it is as slow as every other digital camera I've owned as far as focusing, multiple flashes, and then actually shooting.  You get your subject's attention and they smile, frozen, as you hold down the shutter release for a good 3 seconds until the shot is taken (in low light.) I was especially intrigued by its "Bright Capture" technology, but it honestly doesn't seem any different in low light than my old Sony U20 2MP tiny little snapshot camera.  Still that same flash-in-the-dark look.  There is a fill-flash low light program mode (among many many others), but the shutter speed sets itself so slow the background becomes a messy worthless blob, even if you hold your breath and try to remain still.  My ideal snapshot camera is portable, durable, quick, easy, and produces excellent results without having to think about your exposure modes.  This camera has 3.5 out of those 5.  It is way portable, very durable, easy, produces OK results but you have to mess with settings if you're not in daylight, and it's not very quick. 
Overall I am very happy with the purchase and will carry it everywhere

I can not find anything negative to say about this camera.  I wanted a small pocket sized camera a tried brands such as Casio's Exislim.  Even though this camera is not as small as the Casio, it is far superior of a camera.  Size why's, it is still small enough to fit in a pocket but is also big enough so that it isn't awkward or difficult to use.  The pictures from this camera turn out spectacular, the 10x zoom is by far the best feauture of this camera.  The lcd screen is also very clear, unlike the Casio and other camera's similar to this one.  You can't go wrong with this camera.  Highly recommended

I bought this for my mother-in-law who is in her 80s and set it up for her.  It's quite easy if you're already computer literate, and the controls are very user friendly as well.  The software could use a few tweaks to make it not look so basic, but for someone like my mother-in-law, it works well.

Wish I had a docking station for my Nikon.

The Philips 8-Inch Digital Picture Frame is an excellent, high-quality device.  Very easy to get it going - the included cable and computer software make it simple to select digital pictures already stored on your computer and copy them onto the device.  No need to mess around with memory cards - although the device accepts those as well if that works best for you.  Everyone who has seen ours loves it.  It looks great and the picture quality and size are excellent

This is a FABULOUS gift for grandparents if you preload the pictures.  Just be aware that the customer support folks are not that knowledgeable, probably since the product is new.  Don't bypass their software to load the pix if you're transferring from your PC to the frame - their software reduces the memory needed for each one. And even though the software for different size frames is labelled the same, it is not compatible and you can only have one version installed on your pc at a time

Looked at a number of cameras including the TZ3, P5000, and a few others.  Nothing compared to the G7 which is the one I ended up going with; IS, 6x lens, incredible quality, etc.

If you want the best camera out there and don't feel like messing with a DSLR, the Canon G7 is in a league of it's own ~ The Benchmark by which all other manufacturers strive towards.

This is the perfect camera for me.  I take alot of close-up detail shots and the images come out great.  It is smaller than my old G3 (which I loved, but was pretty chunky)

I bought this camera more than half a year ago. My intention was to get a decent camera for images, but then also be able to use it for filming short movies.

I'm very pleased with its performance. In good lighting conditions, colors come out to be amazing. I really really did not expect them to be so vivid and sparkling! In darker conditions, well, it still works fine, not nearly as bad as I expected from some other reviews. Photos might be grainy or not as vivid anymore, but the stuff is still perfectly suitable to show the photos to people.

As about filming, it's terrific. I mean, resolution is great (sth like 848 by 640 or so), better than what one could possibly expect from a regular camera. And the quality is super awesome, looks very neat on computer screen. Respect.

It has to be pointed out that you cannot zoom while filming, but not many cameras out there can do that.

Oh, it's also very small with a gigantic screen and great battery life. A great buy

Installing the software was a piece of cake, using it is quite another matter. The basic introductory instructions are easy enough but after that it seems to require a PhD in mathematic astrophysics to get round all the available toggles, tweaks and options. First attempts? The moon came out real nice, but Saturn was a white blob with no fine detail. Nothing like type of pics that the super-whizzkids proudly display on the Celestron site. Will go back to night school and one day you might see my fine efforts published as well 
(oh - was using it on a classic LX200 in good see'ing conditions - sorry Celestron!

After buying this camera I was pleased for the most part, as the interface is extremely simple and the picture quality is very good. It's a sleek, smooth design with minimal buttons, thus little confusion. There are 3 things, however, that I'm not happy with. One is that it takes double A batteries, and eats them up REALLY fast. The second thing is that there's no secondary viewfinder, just the LCD screen. The LCD screen is large, which is great.. but this is why the battery life is so low. You can't turn the LCD screen off, so batteries go fast. The third and final thing I dislike about it is that there's no AC adaptor, so whenever you plug your camera into the computer or the TV, not using it to take pictures, you have to run it on batteries. That is, unless you somehow find a compatible 3 volt AC plug, which is neither on the Vivitar website, or anywhere else online that I can find made specifically for this camera. I'm a little upset that it came with no adapter, as that would be SO useful for a camera that eats up batteries. I reccomend rechargibles if you're going to get this camera

I've had this camera for a couple of weeks now, it's my 4th digital camera.  I am very happy with the photos I'm able to take, they are truly outstanding.  I'm still learning all of the settings but I'm finding everything to be user-friendly.  I like the way it feels in my hand and I'm pleased with the battery life.  I purchased a 2GB card to replace the one that came with the camera and it's been the perfect size for me.  The video is amazing, I was standing in the upstairs bathroom of our 2 story house and  saw our little one jumping on the trampoline at the far end of our backyard, so I decided to tape it.  Not only was the quality good, the camera picked up the audio, which I never expected!  And I like that you can zoom in or out while you're taping, I wasn't able to do that with my last camera.

I've had no problems downloading the pics or videos to my computer and the prints I've gotten have been great as well

We had a Canon Powershot S50 3 years ago, loved it. So this time when my husband wanted to buy another digital compact camera, we specifically looked for Canons. 

We originally were thinking of getting the SD700,800 or something like that. But after we compared these cameras together in a store near us. We found out SD900 has the finest LCD display, more opitions in control panel... So we came back and bought it from Amazon (our favorite online store). 

We used it in our last trip to Grand Cayon, LV, SF etc. This SD900 takes very good pictures, especially in good lighting conditions. Colors are also smooth and rich. 

The downside, as you may already read from others' reviews, no battery indication, no raw(it's ok, my husband doesn't do much editiing anyway, it will be too much to ask for a campact camera to offer), control panel is sensitive... don't get frustrated if you happened to pressed the wrong button and couldn't figure the way out during the time of shooting. Stich is a great function which comes with, but when in a very bright area, you can not see the stich alignment very well on the LCD screen (I guess it's a common trouble to all digital compact cameras which are relay on LCD dispay).

Overall, it's a wonderful camera, we love it. It's my husband's camera, I uses Canon 350D, but I borrow it from my husband sometimes because it's tiny compares to my 10 lbs "moose" and it takes very good pictures.

At 10mp, this camera takes some of the clearest and visually stunning pictures I have ever taken with a digital camera.  The clarity and detail alone are reason to get this camera. The display, although pooh-poohed by others as too small, is quite large to me. 

The cameras small, lithe design is another selling point.  Nothing bulky about this camera. You can put it in your front pants-pocket if you needed to. 

Do yourself a favor and get this camera.  You won't regret it.

I needed a new camera to replace my very old digital camera, so I ordered this one and could not be happier with it.

It has all kinds of features, including some manual control options like white balance, etc. for those people who like to mess with that stuff (I'm more of an Auto person, myself).  I used it on vacation last month and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of pictures, after taking only a few test shots to get familiar with the camera.  The camera is very easy to use and gives you a basic user manual to get you started, and also a detailed manual to help you find out how everything works on the camera.  The movie mode works good, too.  The colors come out bright and vivid.  The lag time between pictures is minimal, which is one of the main things I hated about my old 1.3mp Panasonic Palmcam, and the 7.1mp makes for some excellent detail in your pictures.  The only bad thing about the camera, in my opinion, is that it doesn't have a movement stabilizer (or whatever it is called), so it can be prone to shaking, especially when you zoom using the digital zoom.  I like that the camera is small and lightweight, but it is not one of those super thin ones that you feel like you could break in half.

Overall, I think this is a GREAT camera, and I don't think you can find a better camera for the price

I really did some research on digital cameras, even tried out a Sony, but the Canon brand is by far one of the best.  I don't have to do a lot of thinking when snapping a picture with this camera, it does most of the work!  I like to be able to think about the compostion of my photo and not ISO, aperature, and all that jazz.  The settings make it so easy and the color of the photos turn out so true.  The digital zoom is great and will even alert you if the picture will come out blurry.  There are so many features on this camera, too many to list.  I even found a great deal at Best Buy on a 2 gig memory card, I get  over 1,000 photos with a high resolution!  It takes alkaline batteries, but I bought rechargeable ones and one charge lasts a long time.  I am sooo happy with this camera, I take it with me everywhere, even a couple of days to work.

The Canon underwater housings are designed to protect your camera from the elements, whether they are sand, rain, pool, or ocean.  For use on the beach, while snorkeling, or taking shots of your kids in a pool there is little or no need to worry about the buoyancy of your camera housing.  If you free dive or scuba dive you do not want your camera housing floating out of your hands.  These weights are an easy way to adjust the buoyancy of your housing.  The kit comes with four weight plates so you can fine tune your housing's buoyancy.  I prefer a heavier setup and have added an extra plate compared to what was recommended by Canon.  I'm very happy with the setup and they are very easy to use.

I just got my new photo box today.  I was so excited I opened it at work.  Then I took a picture of my wendy's salad just to see how it looked.  The quality of the pictures are excellent(macro mode).  Light is evenly distributed.

Caution about the lights:
The lights get really hot really fast.  Untouchable within 2min. after I turn them on.  I suggest for the shear sanctity of safety, shut off the lights between object/scene changes.

The package arrived intact, the box was beat up a little, nothing major.  When I opened the item, I noticed the Camera stand had pierced the nylon on the bottom.  This could've been a bad/weak stitch, or may have happened during shipping, but nothing major was wrong, only that.  Besides, I can sew it!

Overall, this is a great product, and is easy to setup and carry around.  I'd definitely buy again

I always say that there is technology you can use and technology you can impress others with.
This model helps you do both. You have a nice 5.1 MP still camera and MPEGMovie4TV video.
The very fact that you have a camera which you can take both still pictures and video is huge. I never had a video camera before because I hate to carry two camera and a big camera case, so this was the obvious solution.
I realize that instead of embracing the moment (for which they need the memory) most people often juggle between cameras.
Cons:
* Sometimes people might confuse it with camera phone
* Buttons are harder to find
* Software is not the best
* Wish had more zoom
Pros:
* Convince
* Compact
* Battery lasts long
* Flash is good
* Video sound quality is good
I wonder why this model has not swept the market - another story of good product and mad marketing

We bought this bag for our Panasonic PV-GS400 video camera, this bag is just the perfect size, we can fit our PV-GS400, tapes, extra batteries, recharger, video cables, remote control, and even a small tripod. Has different comparments. On top of functionality is done with a very high quality. I highly recommend it, just check your camera dimensions and compare with the bag before you buy

I bought my K10D in Dec 06 after owning a number of Pentax cameras over the years and being very pleased with the engineering. The combination of features, if executed properly, make this camera the best buy in 10MP DSLRs right now.  I postponed my review because I wanted to get some real field experience.  I just went to Mexico, and panicked because I left the camera instruction manual behind.  I can now report on that trip. I did a little fumbling at first, mainly because I didn't have the manual, but I was soon able to find the combinations I wanted, and the camera performed both flexibly and intuitively.  The AF button and the exposure compensation button are very well placed.  I found myself in difficult lighting situations often, and both AF and exposure metering worked quite well.  I also took some hand-held shots that I normally would use a tripod with (such as at 450mm), and very few came out fuzzy because of camera movement.  In a few cases, I used bracketing, and was easily able to obtain a good balance of details in one or more of the bracketed shots.  Exposure metering worked so well that I stopped bracketing.  I particularly liked the display modes: I could boost the brightness to see the display even in bright daylight, and deep zooming gave me a good check of whether a shot was "soft" or not right at the scene.  The rechargeable Li Ion batteries, although not readily available in stores, seem to last forever (even using power zoom, and full-bright display, and some fill flash).  I believe that I could have shot all week (700 shots in RAW (DNG) + JPEG) with the battery grip attached. In summary, this camera was a pleasure to hold, very easy to use and manipulate, and resulted in a high percentage of crisp photos (even if the percentage of well-composed shots was lower because of the photographer).  I bought it because of its compatibility with Pentax lenses, 10MP sensor, shake-reduction technology, larger display, and especially the dust and water seals.  But what makes me quite happy about it is its overall ease of use and good results.  I am still discovering its features, but I already know that this camera frees me to be creative in ways that other cameras have not in the past.  Some of the features on this camera are unique (new program lines) and some are available only on cameras costing several hundred dollars more, making the K10D a good choice and a best buy.  Once again for Pentax, the engineering is supurb.

This scope is one of the best Gen 1 units on the market. At 36 lines/mm, it has just about the best resolution. Most other units only have 24 lines/mm. The illuminator is bright (almost too bright), uniform, and has a crisp edge. It could be a bit larger, however, so that it would fill the field of view.

Note that if you remove the eyepiece or lens, (to put on the riflescope eyepiece or change the magnification) you will break the seal and the unit will no longer be waterproof.

Don't bother with the IR flashlight. It's output is actually less than the built-in illuminator and it is far from uniform.

Yes, I am slow to make this review, maybe because I spend a great deal of time using this camera.
The ONLY thing I would like to have changed, is a rechargable pack.  At first I burned thru many batteries.  I switched to rechargables, and find that I still use a great deal of power, (I shoot often with the flash,) but now I can recharge the spent batteries after each session.  I use the charge of 12 AA's in a 3 hour shoot.
I use this camera for studio work and it has served me well for a good number of years already

A little background first...

This was an upgrade camera for me, just over a year ago.  I was in 35mm format for over 20 years.  I used a Pentax K1000 body and several different lenses, tele-converters and filters.  At work, I've had 4 years experience with a Fuji Fine Pix 2MP "point-and-shoot".  It was provided by my work and was very durable (it had to be, as I am in Construction Engineering).  When I decided to switch "personally" to all digital I was very cautious.

I first looked for pic quality and durability.  From an "advanced-amature" photographer's point of view, this camera is great !!!

This camera never leaves my side.
It travels with me everywhere I go.
It is extremely durable as it is mounted to an "Ultra-Pod II" and I carry it over my shoulder (I don't keep it in a bag).
It provides me OUTSTANDING QUALITY POHOTGRAPHS (close, far or fast: work or play) at a very reasonable price.
It takes reasonable video (considering my 35mm took none at all).
It is easy to use and learn (even for an old 35mm guy).
It is lightweight and power usage is not an issue (NiMH is the way to go).

I take close to 20,000 pics a year for work and play.  I am always experimenting with this camera and it's limits.  I am so pleased with this camera (and the previous Fuji I used) that my next upgrade will be a Fuji as well (looking to 10MP).

For the $$$ you can't go wrong

Having been engaged in 35mm photography for 32 years, I approached digital photography with great reluctance.  I knew there would be an essential learning phase with less than ideal pictures, like my playing with a brownie for a few years as a kid -- this further delayed my plunge.  Finally, an upcoming trip overseas compounded with the knowledge of what airport metal detectors do to film forced the issue.

My choice was cinched by some pictures we acquired from a friend of papal conclave 2006.  We ran them as a screen saver, and I was much impressed by the sharpness, color tonality, and depth of field -- especially in cloudy day pictures of crowds in public squares.  Faces far into the background were discernable.  I asked what was used and it was this camera.  At the camera store I was heartened to see it felt like a mini SLR in the hand, had a nice big viewer and uncomplicated, straightforward controls.

The learning phase in the backyard and around town gave me some doubts.  Lack of no-shake feature is the model's biggest downside; a lot got blurred especially using the zoom feature on moving subjects.  Some of this you learn to shake out using point focus, but you still are going to lose a few  precious moments despite your best efforts.  Nor with the limited equivalent ASA range are you going to be able to get the sort of pics in museums or dark old cathedrals you are used to with a good SLR and high speed film -- but remember, this one is a starter.  This thing is a monster battery eater, too:  always carry 2 fully charged replacement sets with you.  On the plus side, choice of black and white and chrome mode is very nice feature, and the built-in zoom has a very decent range and performance on stationary subjects.  Speed of use may or may not compare well to other digitals, I don't know, but its a whole world superior to my old world.  There is a rather steely patina to even the best color images, I see now after viewing hundreds, but that's a decent trade-off for the general ease of use and clarity.  Incidentally, the lens on this camera gives you a lot more than what you would expect from a 4 megapixel rating.

Back from Europe this week, I have 2000+ jpegs (the keepers) all of very high quality, an achievement I could not have come close to, I am sure, either with old film camera or with most other starter level digitals.  The continuing issue of shake and blur I surmounted by simply multiple shooting a lot (sometimes 5-7 images); you can erase them almost as quickly as you shoot them, and come to see this as a small nuisance in the bigger trade-off.  

I do not plan to spend the rest of my life with this level digital camera, but even after I move up I think I will keep it around for sheer utilty and ease of use in the general every day world.  For the price, this is about as good a deal as one can hope for.

With most of the carrying case made of either fake leather or some kind of neoprene material, this one is really different.  The rigid structure also seem to do a great job to protect the camera.  There is also a belt loop and D-ring feature which is great.

It's easy to use and makes good pictures, easily a match for the disposable cameras that require you to turn the camera in and wait. I also have a 1GB san card so I can shoot up to almost 1400 pictures. As it is I shoot a couple and then load them into my laptop and send them to people via e-mail

The battery is great and it's pretty nice to own two of these, so when one battery
is discharged I can just pop in the spare.  

It was in stock and delivered to me in a reasonable amount of time

Excelent Battery! I recommend it for all Olympus SLR Digital Cameras. I am using it on my E300 and you can take a lot of pictures in one day. I have 2 batteries because of outdoors shoots and this is really enough.

Got this camera because a friend had a similar one. The blue tooth feature is just great. You need a memory card to make if you want to take video's and store a lot of photos. The video's are not bad and pretty remarkable for a camera this size. All in all a great buy

The camera is great because it is small enough to slip into your pocket and take wherever.  I have been the main picture taker on our family vacations and get-togethers.  We had a 10X optical, 5 MP kodak camera that worked well, it was just big and bulky, never to fit in a pocket.  The 10X optical zoom on the V610 also works well, the lenses never protrude from the camera when I use the optical zoom.  The viewing screen is large and very clear.  The menus are very easy to navigate and the on camera editing tools are great.  It would also make a fine camera for a beginner.  The panorama function works very well also.  I have used it multiple times with ease and it created great pictures. The camera turns on quickly and the time between pressing the button and the photo capture is quick.  I have had the camera for about a month now and the best thing is the small size without having to compromise in zoom, picture quality, or functionality.  The LCD screen does take up some more battery than other cameras just because it is larger, but don't let that stop you from getting the camera.  You will be able to take at least 70 or so pictures on a battery and a lot more if you are conservative.  My only small frustration was when going skiing, I attempted to video my brother coming down the slope using the 10X optical zoom and the image stabilizer.  It was at night and only the lights were on, the camera wouldn't focus on him until he was close, but that may be just because of the low light conditions and glare from the snow. Otherwise the video has worked flawlessly.  There is even a terrific function that allows you to pause the video at any time during playback and create a picture from that video frame. (Very useful)  My brother bought the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ1K,(a very good camera also) before i got the V610 and now he wishes he got the V610

This just arrived Thursday so these comments come with minimal time on camera so far. I am also absolutely an amateur user of camcorders so I won't be able to comment on the quality of the manual controls, etc.

I agree closely with the other two reviews so I won't repeat their details. I'll try to hit a few other topics and also compare the HC7 to the Sony HC90, an earlier model that took 16:9 standard definition video with 3 MP stills.

I have taken about one hour of HD video so far, and have viewed it through an HDMI cable on a Sony 46" XBR LCD TV (1080p). I captured a few indoor scenes, a few neighborhood outdoor scenes, and some footage at Harper's Ferry in West Virginia - river, mountain, and two trains passing by at close range while I was at the railroad station there. I can say comfortably that you won't confuse the video from this camcorder with Standard Definition camcorder video - when they say High Definition, they aren't kidding.  If your TV can show the video off to advantage and you've grown fond of HD, I think you'd be pleased with this camcorder.  In my case, the overwhelming reason I upgraded camcorders was to get the HD video, so this has made it worth the steep expense. My second requirement is to have a camcorder that took decent stills so I only have to carry one piece of equipment around. I already had this in the Sony HC90 at 3MP, so going up to 6MP was desirable but not enough to make me buy something this expensive in itself.

My only output criticisms so far are that the West Virginia footage looks a little brighter and the water a little greener than I remember. I didn't play with any settings so take that with a grain of salt. These camcorders have a lot of manual adjustments you can make which I have not explored. One or more of them undoubtedly would have given me improved footage, and I'm not unhappy with what I think I noticed in the slightest.

The stills look very good to me so far, but I've only taken about 20 and viewed them on the TV. I normally view stills on a PC.

I don't have a telephoto lens yet so I can't report on the quality of the stabilization. I used a tripod today and that was readily apparent in the stability of the video.  I was very pleased, by the way, with how well the camera did with the moving trains. Very crisp where I expected a fair bit of motion blur.

LCD size and controls have been mentioned in First Looks. I'm perfectly happy with a 2.7" LCD instead of the larger one in the UX7. So this wasn't a negative for me personally. The controls (menus) are highly similar to those of the Sony HC90 I already have. If you haven't seen them before, there's a learning curve. If you have the HC90 or another camcorder with those menus, you'll be right at home with the HC7. One note: you can configure P[ersonal]-Menus to include the things you use the most in your own order, in addition to the camcorder's menus. One thing I forgot is that each mode (video, camera, play/edit) has its own configurable personal menu. So I was looking for things to add to the Play/Edit personal menu that I was sure should be configurable, but couldn't find them. That was because they belonged only to the filming side, not to the playback side. So you've got three personal menus you can create, not one.

Battery: check the sizes on the batteries. The HC90 batteries were very thin. I think three of the batteries for the HC7 fit entirely within its case. The fourth and largest battery looked to be much bigger in one dimension such that I thought it would extend past the end of the camera 1/2" or so. The other three will fit flush into the back of the camera, though they're not behind a door or anything.

Battery life: my impression so far is that the battery life statements are accurate, but the batteries drain faster than that of the HC90. This is almost certainly a function of increased power load instead of the older batteries being better than the newer ones.  The CCDs and the stills and everything are all "more" than in the HC90. So I think I'm fine with the battery life, but you'll need to watch it and definitely have more than one battery.

Size compared to the HC90: this struck me as being about 10-15% bigger overall than the HC90. It's maybe 1/2" longer front to back, and wider as well. I think the HC7 is one notch up in size from the average camcorder I see in Best Buy. But it's noticeably smaller than last year's SR1 Sony hard disk camcorder, say. I don't see dropping this one in a coat pocket like I did with the HC90, but it's pretty light and still fits in the case I used for the HC90 if I don't load other stuff in there.

Fit in the hand: I found a Best Buy with an HC5 and UX5 on hand and played with both at the same time. These have the same footprint as the HC7 and UX7 as far as I can tell. The HC5's tape case is maybe 3/8" wider than the UX5's DVD case.  The UX5's DVD case is maybe 1/4" higher. So I found that my right-hand fingers curled nicely around the smaller but taller UX5 and it felt slightly more comfortable. However, I found that the HC5's extra width made me curl my palm slightly such that the base of the camcorder fit solidly on top of the ball of my thumb. As I played with this in the store, I realized it seemed like the HC5 actually was easier to hold stable because of this. Absolutely try these two out on your own instead of assuming this will be true for you. Just wanted to say that the two cases do differ a bit and will probably feel different to you at some level.

Tape vs DVD (really HDV vs AVCHD): I spent a lot of time wondering if the noise reported in last year's AVCHD UX camcorders would still be present, and if I would care in any case. The detailed reviews still aren't out, so I don't know whether there will be a noise problem there. But I can say I noticed nothing in the footage so far that I'd call noise, so my decision to go with the tape and HDV format looks very good to me right now. I have never had the problems people report with Mini-DV tapes, so that whole transport discussion (tape vs DVD) didn't weigh on me much. The noise discussion did have an effect on my decision, though.

Getting the video to your TV: "how much money do we have?", apparently. I played the tape back to the TV directly, but that's not a long-term solution. I have heard that you can capture the HDV video and then will be able to transform it on a PC to formats suitable for Blu-Ray or HDV burners, if you have the money. Then you need a Blu-Ray or HDV player attached to your TV. For now, it sounds like many people are archiving the HDV video to DVDs as data files. Then they burn playable DVDs where the HD is down-converted to standard definition video.  So they get to see decent versions of the video now and can produce HD versions for playback in the future as technology changes and prices drop.  One other HC7 reviewer also implied that HD files captured by Ulead software could be moved to a PS3 hard drive and played back to an HD TV from there. So far, the easy and cheap path we have for SD video to DVDs to TVs is not quite there for HD based on what I've read. 

The one extra feature I wish the camcorder had was a built-in 20X optical zoom. I'm sure this would affect both the cost and the size of the barrel negatively, so I "understand". But that would be #1 on my wish list.

Overall, I am amazed at what camcorder manufacturers can pack into these shells now.  I know we're talking computers that are way more powerful at image processing than anything that existed ten years ago.  But it is still almost like magic to drag a camcorder of this size around, take some video, and then have play it back on a high-quality HD TV looking to me like it was taken with broadcast-level equipment. I know better intellectually, but it's really great to have a camcorder like this that marries up with the new TVs so beautifully.

I am totally satisfied with Product features. For me still it's  better than any available product from other company in this segment.
I ranked this product 4 because it manual dial malfunction very often. If I select Album mode it still thinks to be in SnapShot mode and vice-versa. It's out of guarantee and I'll hv to live with it.
Anyway there are many products present in market in this series to go with like W50 or something like that

After owning and using the camera for a month or so now, I am delighted with it.  I have only replaced the batteries one time, so don't know what the review hullabuloo about that was for.  small lightweight, many features.  choice of 6 meg, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 meg photos at fingertips.  What I really decided on this camera for was the MACRO capability as I take photos of very small coins, and must be able to get in within an inch or two to do that.  It preforms magnificantly.  My previous camera had to add additional lens to do this which was a hassle.  I love the Samsung digimax S600.

Wow..Okay so I was thinking this was a screen about the size of a smaller camera because I didnt read the dimensions before I bought it here on amazon so i was a little disappointed in the size. this is about HALF the size of an ipod mini. It is by no means big . read the dimesions well before you purchase. 

The photos are really good quality and clear ..just small lol.

Okay, I am new to the world of stargazing.  I purchased this telescope based on recommendations here at Amazon.com.  I have been completely satisfied.  I am especially impressed with the clear, crisp viewing of the moon.  I can see a few planets, but they are of course very small through the eyepiece.

I do have a suggestion to anyone who may purchase this telescope.  Take your time putting it together.  Read all the directions first.  Pay special attention to the details concerning the Collimator.  If you don't know what that is, you need to.  I almsot made some major mistakes, screwing and unscrewing parts that needed to be left alone.  

If you pay attention to all of the details on the instructions, you will have the telescope together in a couple of hours and be well on your way to enjoying yourself, especially on a clear night.

The package containing my telescope arrived in four days and was completely intact.  I couldn't be happier with my purchase.  I am sure a more avid sky-watcher might want a little something more, but for the once-in-a-while gazer, this is the telescope.

See ya next review.

I needed an extra battery.  This whole kit was cheaper than the price of the battery alone.  In addition to the battery, you get a standard camera case (Retail $10-20) and a very nice shoulder bag intended to carry 2 cameras, accessories, and the portable Canon printer.  There is absolutely nothing not to like about this deal

I bought one of these items in December '04 from Adorama.  It had directions written in raised letters on the canister itself.  I just ordered here and received a second one in March '07 and the "new" model has no instructions.  Other than that, it looks identical to the old one, so I assume the contents are the same.
Here are the exact words written on the old one:
"HYDROSORBENT 40 GRAM SILICA GEL"
"WHEN PINK, REACTIVATE 3 HOURS AT 300F"
The pink referred to is the little circle in the center of the canister.

I keep this product with my camera (in closed stuff sack) and it seems to work as advertised - though I guess you just have to have faith that it does - no easy way to prove it (except maybe in extremely humid climes)

For those wishing to purchase this product, and who also want accessory filters to protect the lens, or to add special effects, although not mentioned, the size of the filter is 30mm. (NOT the 37 mm mentioned at other locations, which caused me to order the wrong size which now must be returned.)

To my knowlege, there simply isn't a better equipped camera for the professional investigator.  It's IR-sensitive mode (nightshot) is in B&W (rather than cheeseygreen), far superior quality-wise to anything Sony's got, and it's the only 3CCD that I know of with a low-light mode.  The image stabilization is exceptional and the image quality is production grade.  Time/Date stamps can be "burned in" so they xfer via firewire - again, the only camera I'm aware of with this feature.  The audio can be turned off which we know is a must.  And best yet, you can disable the sleepmode so it won't turn off eliminating missed money shots waiting for the camera to cycle back on.  It's built like a tank and feels substantial in the hand, but it's still lightweight thanks to an alloy frame.  Finally, it's totally silent even with the tape transport in full swing.  

The ONLY downside so far as I can tell is it's size - It's a big camera compared to the handicams I've had, and wouldn't be well suited for close-proximity work.  However, the black casing dosn't print/siloutte terribly, and the 16x optical lets you set back quite a bit.

Highly recommended!

I'm by no means an expert, but I really wanted a reasonably priced video camera that could produce the highest quality picture for the price.  I did a TON of research and landed on the AG-DVC30 after much agonizing over "to HD or not HD" as well as brands and features.  Based on all the reviews I read, this camera seemed to offer the most features and the best video for the money.  I have not been disappointed.  On my first outing, I took the cam to the Grand Canyon and Sedona.  Wow!  What incredible color and clarity!  I also really love the 16x zoom.  It's smooth and powerful.  I got great shots of the Colorado River from the rim of the Grand Canyon.  I'll agree with all reviewers that the audio is not great.  It is not super sensitive so you lose sound if not quite close to the subject.  If you're interested in good audio, I'd suggest an optional mic.  If you just want great video, awesome color, and ease of use, this is your camera.  At the price (plus the rebate) you really can't beat it

I bought these Binoculars for my Dad for Christmas, and he is absolutely in love with them.  The distance it can handle is slightly above average, but the clarity is really where this thing shines.  Its very easy to use, and has held up reasonably well.  I would recomend it to the casual user

It is a great camera, very small and gives very good photos in most circumstances.  Grainy pic in dim light. Go to the casio website to download the new firmware for 4GB SD card compatibility.  You will get over 1500 high res photos with a 4 GB card, where outpost is selling for 5o dollars a car

This digital photo frame has reasonably good picture quality and once set up, can be used by anyone in the selected mode.  I have it set for slide presentation mode and people enjoy looking at it.  I could easily see giving it, already set up, to people who are not computer savvy, such as grandparents.  To give them new pictures, send a new card and they slip that in.  That said, the cost is still fairly high and the buttons on the top of the frame useless unless you have them memorized or really good vision.  I would recommend this product

We got this camcorder for our daughter for her birthday and she loves it! Her only problem with it is that a memory card is needed because there isn't as much space as she would like and alot of light is needed to film. We were aware of both of these complaints when we purchased it but we were certain that she could work around them. We were also aware of the battery problem, so she got rechargeable batteries. Awesome little camcorder, especially for the price

I RECENTLY RECIEVED MY NEW CAMERA, AND I AM THRILLED.  I HAVE BEEN RESEARCHING WHICH CAMERA TO BUY SINCE DECEMBER (WHEN OUR LAST CAMERA WENT CAPOOT).  THERE HAVE BEEN MIXED REVIEWS FOR THE OLYMPUS SW SERIES, BUT COULD NOT RESIST THE APPEAL OF THIS CAMERA'S UNIQUE FEATURES.  I CANNOT WAIT TO TAKE IT INTO THE POOL THIS SUMMER WITH THE KIDS.  SO FAR, THE POINT AND SHOOT OPTIONS AND PICTURES HAVE BEEN LOVELY.  ANY PERSON CAN SCREW UP PICTURES WITH ANY CAMERA, BUT THIS CAMERA HAS SO MANY FEATURES TO AVOID THAT.  MY HUSBAND AND I HAD A WONDERFUL TIME TAKING EXTREME CLOSE UP SHOTS OF OUR GARDEN.  I HAVE NOT SEEN THAT QUALITY, AND HAD THAT MUCH SATISFACTION FROM A CAMERA SINCE WE FIRST SWITCHED OVER TO DIGITAL.  I AM VERY PLEASED, TO SAY THE LEAST, WITH THIS PURCHASE.

If you are expecting clear professional sound transmission, this is not it.  That's a wireless system costing $1,000 - $3,000.  This  system is strictly for home none professional use.  I think people were expecting this system to deliver the hi fidelity sound they hear on movies or TV soundtrack.  Professionals do not use this system.  That is the reason for the low price.  Home movies only.

This product is so cool.  Whatever your situation is, if you have a lot of digital pictures, then I recommend going out and getting an SD card...preferably up to 1GB (or even 512MB), for use this with this product.  Even if your camera doesn't use SD, you can plop the SD card right into the picture frame and upload photos from your computer TO the card!  It's like a little computer, this frame.  Another big suggestion I have is to find a program online that resizes your photos to the dimensions of the frame (photo size explained in other reviews). (I downloaded Visualizer Photo Resize).  This will take photos down from its original size (e.g. 1.8 MB) to a smaller size (e.g. 500KB).  This will let your store dramatically more photos.  So far I have fit over 1700 photos in about 430MB worth of the 1GB SD card that I have!  The picture quality is very good and the frame can swivel to basically any angle and could be used horizontally or vertically.  Plus, it is a Philips, which is a great brand.  I have a Philips HD TV as well and it is my baby...I love it.  This is a great present for anyone!  How can you go wrong with a picture frame that replaces its picture any time you want

This can be used in lieu of a replacement battery.  Plus if an electrical outlet is convienent, like when shooting inside, you never have to worry about running out of power.  Also handy if you are mobile and have a auto dc/ac converter.  But not as overall convienent as an extra battery.  I thought it would also trickle recharge the battery, but it doesn't.  Nikon should add this feature in

I had an Olympus Stylus 4MP and loved it but wanted a newer model.  I purchased this 710 and love it.  Olympus makes it so easy to take pictures with pre-set options and image stabilization.  I love the smaller size of this camera and it was easy to use.  There is no way to give it 4 1/2 stars so I gave it 5 but there is one thing I don't like about the area for the USB plug in. You have to pop off this cap (it hangs off the camera) and maneuver the small end of the cable in the camera (tight fit with the cap hanging there) then pop the cap back on..it just seems flimsy and I wonder if that cap will eventually break off.  In the 410 it was much easier to access this as it was near the memory card.  That is the only design feature I don't care for on the 710.  It is a great camera and I am very happy with the purchase.

An excellent purchase that lives up to the Sony name. My main concern before buying it was that it would swivel enough that I could point my mini-camera straight down to take macro photos of documents. It does this easily, and the legs don't get in the way. It's small enough to chuck in my backpack and take it all the time in case I need it, and it has its own little sturdy fabric carrying bag so that it doesn't get tangled up in anything else. Overall, I would rate it as excellent

Picked mine up used on eBay for $180.  With the growth of the VR market everyone is dumping there old lenses.  You can get a used one for a great price.  This lens is great for the serious amatuer.

I have taken some incredible pictures with this lens.  The autofocus is a little slow and I have heard people complain about softness on the high end but I have a photo blown up to 20 x 17 taken from my D70 at 300mm.  Of course I shoot the photo on a tripod.... I have not experienced the softnes

Go to Nikon's own website NikonUSA.com and compare the technical specifications of this version and the 'G' version of this lens.  There are only three differences.  One is that the 'G' version has its aperture set only by the camera body, while the 'D' version can have its aperture set either by the body or by a ring on the lens.  All recent Nikon bodies set the aperture.  The ring on the lens is invariably locked on all recent camera bodies.  The second difference is that one (1) of the 13 lens elements in the D version of the lens is made of Extra Low Dispersion (ED) glass.  If the dispersion difference is so important what is the deal with the other 12 elements?  Sounds like marketing to me.  The third difference is that the 'D' version costs three times as much as the 'G' version

These binoculars provide a good tool for night time
sky viewing.  Easier to carry than a telescope with
the advantage of using both eyes.  The tripod mount
can be used with most any tripod with a standard screw mount.
The 15 power makes hand holding a challenge but with practice
they work great.

The binoculars were suprisingly lightweight for their size and power.
The 70mm lens were great at light gathering, and the 4.75 mm exit pupil
provide more light than most adults can use.  (The avg. is 3-4 mm)
With a good strap is easy to wear for long periods and excellent for long distance terrestrial viewing or general astromical use.  You really need a tripod to use the full power effectively, but for short periods those with steady hands can enjoy the binocs on the fly

Bought these batteries & charger just before going on an overseas trip.  I didn't want to be bothered with frequently changing AA batteries, which seemed to last only a day or so of heavy use.  I was quite pleased with the performance of these rechargeables.  They lasted several days of heavy use before needing to be charged and they re-charged in only a few hours.  A big bonus that I didn't expect:  the recharger is compatible with European 240 voltage so I didn't have to use an electric converter!

I bought this together with the Sony Alpha (very good deal from Amazon). The lens is a great complement to the kit lens or the identical but older KM 18-70. Images are very sharp and the lens is built very well. Great for wildlife imaging. The other reviewers are right; the AF isn't too good at the long end of this lens but overall a great camera.
The end of the lens DOES ROTATE while zooming. It may not be good for some filters

This is a great camera for travel and everyday events because of its small and convenient size.  We bought it to replace our bulkier Sony DSC-F707.  The large screen is wonderful!  The video feature is a lot of fun but due to the small size it is hard to take a steady video.  The battery meter is very useful as it tells you how much time you have left.  The main downside with this camera is the flash.  It doesn't work well in very dark conditions for distant or even slightly distant shots.  If it weren't for the flash, I would have given this a rating of 5 stars.  This is overall a good camera.

For more serious digital photography, we prefer to use the Sony DSC-F707 as it has a better flash and zoom.  However, it is too bulky to carry around

We purchased this camera as a replacement for our bulky Sony DSC-P52, which stopped working after year or so due to a problem with the lens mechanism. Naturally, only time will tell if this is any different, but in the meantime, here's what you need to know about this baby:

The Good:

1) Size and weight - Fits almost comfortably in any pocket. Much thinner and lighter than any previous digital camera I've owned, thus encourages one to carry it most anywhere. The size is also pretty comfortable for one-hand shooting.

2) Big LCD screen - You didn't need me to tell you this, right? Makes previewing images and taking shots much more satisfying, though sometimes it does not appear very clear, especially if the subject is not static. However, it is bright and rich in color.

3) InfoLithium - This is Sony's name for a battery that tells you how much time it has left - only approximately, of course. If use is consistent, will provide you with a good idea. If you use one function then another then another, it tends to vary much more and is not as useful. 

4) Integrated charger/USB station - A flimsy plastic cradle takes care of charging the on-board battery as well as providing a USB hookup for downloading images and video into the computer. Minimizes wires and removes the need for a separate charger, though the bright white color is far from a match.

The Bad:

1) Focusing problems - The camera cannot focus on objects that are relatively close to it. I am not speaking about macros, but simply the function - or lack thereof - to focus on small, near objects, such as coins, stamps, or text. Quick focus on objects farther away, though.

2) Integrated Battery - I listed the InfoLithium as a positive, but the fact that you cannot just pop-in a couple of AA batteries means you will always need the station or the plug to charge up if you need some juice. I don't know if the battery is universal, but even if it is, it will cost substantially more to purchase a replacement.

3) Incompatible Memory Sticks - I will not complain about Sony's desire to make consumers pay more for its cards than adopting a standard, but this camera uses the MemoryStick Duo, which is about 1/4 or so smaller than the "regular" MemoryStick. This means that the hundreds you may have invested in memory cards for previous Sony digital cameras are pretty useless, as they do not fit into this or any other device using the smaller cards.

4) Ineffective Flash - The flash is tiny, thus does not provide adequate illumination in the dark. Within a few feet is okay, but farther subjects are not touched.

5) 3x Optical Zoom - C'mon, this is 2005! 3x optical zoom is pretty pathetic for such an expensive camera.

6) Slow Write Speed - There is a decent pause between pictures, meaning you not be able to shoot at a rapid rate. You can certainly take pictures in bursts, but it takes even longer to write to the memory stick. Previewing the images is also slow. This is also disappointing, as it's not faster than my older P52.

7) No Tripod Hookup - If you wish to use a tripod, you have to mount the camera on the plastic station, then connect the tripod to the plastic dock. This is far from ideal.

Well, there you have it. The negatives I listed may be insignificant for you, in which case this could be a great value for you. I am certainly happy with it, but I only wish Sony would stop treating its customers like cash cows with changing standards, compatibilities, and dubious long-term quality

I've owned the T9 now for just about 3 weeks.  I purchased it after some extensive research.  Of course you never really know a product until you've had it awhile.  Here's my thumb nail opinion.
I like:
The ultra thin metal body
Optical image stabilizer
great photo quality
high ISO performance
large, high rez screen
Auto focus assist lamp works well
very fast start-up
fast recovery even after flash
lots of built in memory, but you need to buy the 1 or 2 gig card
ok slide show feature with music

I don't like:
Redeye doesn't work that well
Too few manual controls
needs white balance
needs long shutter speed modes
Chews up battery time pretty fast. Already ordered a second battery.
No optical viewfinder (most ultra smalls don't)
flimsy plastic cover over the battery will be first thing to break

All in all a great little camera.  Takes awesome, clear pics.  Not for the professional photographer, but that's not why you are considering it (I hope).

Very compact, light and easy to hold - full marks for design. Buttons etc can take a bit of getting used to, but ok once mastered. Main downside for me it only takes DVD-R/RW- and not DVD-R/RW+, bit of a problem when you pick up the wrong ones! Also, can be a problem taking it abroad - I had issues charging it as it would take a standard US to UK converter plug as the pins are slightly wider than normal US plugs.

This is the only tripod that I have ever owned, however, I do agree that it seems to be a very nice piece of equipment, especially for the very low price. It suits my needs well for a small digital camera. The only downside is that it does not come with a carry bag. This was an oversight on my part when I ordered, and I'm sure I would have to pay just as much as I did for the tripod to get a bag for it, so I will live with it as is

  The Panasonic PV-GS500 was discontinued in late 2006 in anticipation of Panasonic's new 2007 models which will be available in the Spring.

  The PV-GS500 is compact, delivers stunning video in moderate lighting and above, has a lot of features that will appeal to the aspiring pro-sumer videographer. It lacks an audio output jack, which many will fault it for. It does have a separate microphone jack. The menu is driven by a toggle and is easy to use.

  It is reall aimed at the casual videographer who wants superb quality in a compact, uncomplicated package and it delivers precisely that.

  Low-light performance is poor, but there is an accessory shoe, so you can mount an auxillary light. I would suggest getting an accessory bracket that provides two or three accessory shoes so you can use both a shotgun microphone and an auxillary light for weddings, parties and other group events.

  Battery life is about what you would expect, so carrying one or two spare batteries is recommended.

  All in all, a very nice 3CCD camcorder for the advanced amateur or just someone who wants superb image quality in an easy-to-use package.

The case is beautiful leather. Seems sturdy and well made. Would have been more functional if the belt holder was open ended, I thought. I ordered it for my son, but found it very feminine when it arrived. I had to give it to someone else

Of course, it had to be Kodak. No matter what people say, i have always and will always use a kodak digital camera, I've found this camera to be a real warrior, last one I had lasted about 4 year and this one looks even better, Photo cuality its very good and colors are great, no excesive blue or red in your pics, Night photo taking its excelent in close shots.

4 stars beacuse its really a batterie eater, but its nothing a 25$ batterie charger can`t solve. 

Sorry for grammar mistakes but english is not my natal lenguaje

I bought this camera to replace a 3MP Kodak CX series when I thought I had lost it.  My 3MP took great pics and I never had any problems with it and I didn't want to have to learn to use a different brands software.

The Kodak easyshare software didn't impress me much when I bought the first camera but they have made some improvements and the updated version is much better.  The Kodak gallery is a nice option that allows you to share pics without sending large email files.

I haven't used the C533 a lot since I bought it but the pics I've taken have come out great. But just like the other reviews state, slow shutter speed at low light and it does like batteries.  However, if you spend the extra money for the Lithium batteries you'll get much improved battery life.

All in all a great value and a perfect camera for a point and shoot person

Worked like a charm in my Panasonic AG-DV30 video camera!  Having 5+ hours of battery life really helps when you're on vacation and don't want to mess with charging batteries or being "selective" in your shooting.  This gives you the freedom to tape what you want and edit out the boring stuff later.  Worth the money and a good deal here

    I purchased this camera as a replacement for Canon Optura 20 which was dropped and when estimate for repair exceeded price of this camera, I decided to move on. After using DCR-HC28 for several weeks, I believe this is a very neat package. Overall, I am very satisfied with this camera. One of the first things that I noticed is that color representation in low light conditions is much more accurate than that of Canon. I grew accustomed to adjusting Optura's white balance indoor in order to get accurate color tones. Now I am finding, that automatic settings work just fine and, in fact, I didn't have a reason to play with presets as of yet. This camera is more of a "point and shoot" type than Canon. It provides you with manual controls, but they are not easily accessible. Still, I have not found a reason to mess with these. Besides, for those, who would claim that manual settings are necessary for advanced/professional type of filming, I would point to the price tag and ask where and when did they last see an advanced/professional camera for under $300? 
    This camera is also about half the size of Canon and combined with low price and weight, produces a package that I can drag with me while going to the beach, bicycling, hiking, etc and not having to worry about ruining expensive piece of electronic gear, as was the case with my Optura which, at the time when I bought it, cost me about 2.5 times of what I paid for Sony.
    So far, I've used this camera in about all of the lighting conditions that I would expect to ever having to consider. I have NO COMPLAINTS about its performance. Picture seems to be sharply focused and color tones are correct. Focus is fast enough to keep up with little kids or to shoot some sports/action. Sound quality of the microphone is quiet acceptable. There seems to be very little noise from drive motor and it is not picked up by the mic so it is not transferred to your recording. All of the essential controls and menus are within easy reach.
    There are few negative points that prevent me from giving this camera 5-star rating. Lack of any kind of accessory shoe or external microphone input is a drawback. It would be nice to have these, as it would increase range of conditions under which one can use it. Still, among my friends, who actually have a camcorder, about 90% don't own an accessory light or external microphone, so if it was possible to lower camera cost by omitting these features, it is not a criminal move on part of Sony. The LCD display could have been a bit larger and it would not hurt if Sony would provide it with more freedom of motion - it only swings out to 90 degree angle and in certain situations it is a limiting factor.

What I love about this case is its softness and its superior quality. It fits just like a glove and it protects the camera at the time it never poses a danger to it. (I have had other older cases that scratched or even crushed the cameras). This one seems to be an improved model. 
It does not need to have handles because you are supposed to use the strap on the camera. Highly recommendable

  I bought this dock from a seller called Miga.  They did an excellent job of answering my questions on the product and sending everything in mint condition.  I use the dock for my HP R817.  Having read the reviews regarding the insert I just went through HP's part site and ordered the correct insert for my camera.  It was only $5 (before shipping) and it arrived the same day as the dock package.  The dock transfers data so much faster then the cradle that comes with the camera plus it has an extra battery which would cost $50 and up by itself from HP.  I bought the dock for its dual charging ability for when I go on trips since this dock is less expensive then the fast charge travel kit.  I probably won't use the remote control feature or print images right from the dock.  But for what I will use it for its an excellent product for the price and I highly recommend it for you 817 818 users out there.

Buy this cable through amazon and you won't be sorry. I looked all over the internet and its sometimes hard to find a good company online to buy through and after the manufacture was sold out these cables , a friend told me about amazon , I typed in the cable number and amazon had it in stock . I decided to order this and hope for the best well sure enough the cable arrived on time just like amazon said . I know have a great working usb cable for my digital camera . I order three since all my friends and family always ask to borrow mine and the fact that I need a replacement. If I had the money I would buy five of these. Its the fact that me, my family, and friends are always misplacing are cables or losing them. So I order this cable through amazon. Its nice to know if I lose my cables I can buy more. Ever since I bought these cables I have been making sure I know where I put em. Be Happy  and buy with no worries

I originally bought the Edit 120 (no detachable case) but was looking for a separate bag in which to keep the cables that are not used often (to leave at home).  Then I came across the Edit 120+ with the detachable case which fit the bill exactly.  Not haven actually seen the detachable bag yet, I was somewhat concerned about the method/design of the atachment.  It needed to be easy to remove, but it also needed to be secure; the pictures I found on the internet didn't show how it was attached.  

I was relieved when I actually saw how it was attached.  There is a slotted bottom on the main bag the entire length of the bag (an open slot is at each end).  The add-on bag has a wide semi-rigid flap that slides through the slotted bottom and a fold down tab on the free end that is secured by velcro.  The attachment method is secure and is almost invisable, and the design compliments the aesthetics of the original bag.  I think the original bag is very good, and the add-on detachable bag makes this a superb choice.  

Unfortunately, you have to buy this as a combination.  If you originally bought the 120 single bag version, it doesn't have the slotted bottom on it and can't be retrofitted (and I don't think they sell the detachable bag separately)

This case is vital to protect the lightweight S1 which could be easily damaged from a drop.  The case does not detract from the convenience of the S1, it adds virtualy no bulk to the camera so that it still slips in a pocket or a purse easily.

Yep, we love this camera! Amazon got it to us just in time for our trip to Las Vegas and we got wonderful footage and great still shots of our trip. The still shots are amazing, you can really zoom in close and get great clear shots of things our regular digital camera couldn't. In fact we tested this and have proof, as we had both cameras with us. My son got a great close up of Star Jones from far across the gathered crowd, right up to her face as if he were standing right in front of her, and my photo from the same area is so pixilated and blurry you can't even tell what the subject was! I love that we have two cameras in one, video and stills, so we don't have to carry both. I really like that there is a separate card for the still photos so low battery power doesn't threaten to wipe the memory clean. We eventually got a longer life battery but the one hour did just fine on our trip. It would be nice to have a separate battery charger, but it really didn't get inconvenient, we'd just plug it in while we slept and we were ready for the day when we woke up. And the price was excellent for all the features we got. Yep, we love this camera

I have been using the Fuji E550 for almnost two years, with none of the problems that have been reported by some of the reviewers. 

Here are the negatives: 

1) The flash has mediocre range and is a little finicky. If you don't depress the shooting button all the way, it may not flash. 

2) In bright light, the screen on the back is unusable - it washes out the image. BUT the camera has a fine viewfinder so this is not really a major issue.

The positives:

1) It takes great pictures. Really excellent.

2) It's small, and easy to carry.

3) The controls are well thought out and positioned on the camera body. Very easy to use. 

4) It has several automatic modes - sports, landscapes, portrait, etc, or you can use it on manual. I always use one of the programmed modes. 

5) The video option is not bad at all - my twelve year old (now 13) uses it.

I was so pleased with this camera I bought one for my administrative assistant about ten months ago, and she is very happy with it.

At it's current price I think this camera is a bargain. Only reason I didn't give it five stars is because of the weak flash.

This product fits my camera perfectly and is not at all bulky.  A great safeguard from falls and the Velcro latch provides just enough security.

I was amazed on how well this battery has performed. I did make sure when I got it I did a complete charge and complete discharge and it has not let me down since. I can shoot well over two hours without needing to change to the very meek battery that came with my camcorder (Sony HDR-HC1). It is thicker and sticks off the back a little bit more so you can not get your eye up to the eyepiece but I use the LCD when shooting anyway, and almost always on tripod

I have the Sony battery that came with the camera and bought an additional Sony battery that allowed for 2-4 hours. However, I wanted a battery that I could count on for the better part of an "all day" event and I found it in the QM91D.  

I was asked to photograph a wedding from getting ready (hair dresser at 0830, until the end of the reception at 11:30pm) The QM91D held strong.  I did not constantly video tape, but with my digital recorder I had 6 sony 120 tapes (60 min digital) -- 5 were captured using the QM91D.  I did switch some of the tapes before they were completely used to make sure I didn't miss important events ... so I never actually used up "all" of the QM91D battery.

This battery was used again during the evacuation from Houston (secondary to Hurricane Rita) -- I used it entirely and it did not faulter ... it lasted throughout the trip and I had no need to change to the smaller batteries.  

The size of the battery did not really bother me -- I was aware that it would be larger than the others and it did not hamper the use of the camera.

Read the manufacturer information on battery life, charging time etc ... for this battery it is valid.  

I would recommend this battery.

I bought this item to be used with my Sony HDR-HC3 camcorder in combination the fig rig. It works as advertised. I do wish the clamp portion of the item was removeable, but it can be worked around. I found the remote to be very responsive, as you would expect from Sony. And the price was a bargin.

I purchased this kit, primarily for the extra battery, which retails for about what I paid for this item.  Having the backup battery is great, but I was pleasantly suprised by the soft case.  It protects my DSC-P200, without being bulky or heavy.  With the camera being so small, it was hard to find good protection without spending quite a bit of money.  The case for the memory sticks is nice as well.  It is easy to lose a stick if it's just floating around and the case keeps them securely.  All in all, this is an excellent value

The camera is good. Had it 1 week now. Low light it works and produces fair results. Bright light is much better. Small and light weight. You must use the supplied docking station to transfer as ther is no USB port on camera . There is the  DC in and TV out on camera (as well as the docking station...just no usb...why? ) 30GB hard drive is plenty...maybe too much. If you fill  this up you are looking at 8 DVD's and hours of transfer. The software is weak and conflicts with Roxio 7.5.  Roxio became unusable.  Roxio stinks anyway.  Found a simple program to burn after this...ASHAMPOO. Plan on getting Adobe Premier Elements, too. Amazon had the best deal...89 less 30 mail in rebate from Adobe.  Much better then the software in box.  My first cam as we now have a cute baby.  Easy to keep it rolling and have gigs to save.

Out of the box this is a simple to use camera.  The convenience of having the video or picture right on a hard drive is great.

I did a lot of searching and this one was the most bang for the buck.

Just starting to use it so can't say much for now.  My wife loved it for its size and weight

This is a good padded case for your camera.  But The back pocket shown in the picture with a phone stick out, was not deep enough for my phone with antenna attached.  It measure 4"x 3.5".  But other than that I enjoy using this bag

I have just purchased my second M407 Camera, yes that's right I said the second one. I purchased the first about a year ago and have used it in the Wilds of Idaho taking pictures in all kinds of weather at every elevation imaginable. All the pictures have turned out great. I recently had a reason to take more pictures indoors, new grand daughter. Again the pictures have been fantastic, have had several blown to 11X17 for matting and framing, great quality. I would make several suggestion to folks, buy digital camera batteries, every camera I have owned eats batteries, this HP is no different. If you spend the money and get good quality batteries they will last!  Second recommendation get a SD Memory card, if you are like me you will not be happy with the interanl memory and want to take lots of pictures.  So, this photographer says you can't beat the price, for the quality and service you get from HP. I forgot to mention I had a camera that didn't work, and HP replaced within 2 days with a new one, no questions asked. Good Service goes a long way in my book.  Buy one you won't be sorry!

After reading dozens of reviews for both this case and the PSC-55, I was still undecided on a case for my Canon SD630.  So, I purchased both to see for myself which one would work.  Because red is my favorite color, I really wanted the red case to fit (PSC-90).  The camera will fit in the case, but it's a VERY tight fit.  I had to shove the camera in the case to make the snap close.  The PSC-55 is still a very snug fit, but allows for some extra breathing room which I feel is better for the safety of the camera.

In addition, here's something to consider if you're deciding between the two cases: the inside lining of the PSC-90 is more of a rigid nylon material, while the lining of the PSC-55 is a softer felt material.  The case overall is still rigid, but I like the thought of my camera resting against a softer lining.  Based on that alone, I'm going with the PSC-55 - I feel that this will be more friendly to the 3" screen on the SD630.

Both cases are a very nice leather and are very attractive - I'm pleased with the Canon brand

when it comes to buying camcorders, i personally like the one with the build in memory. but after using this camcorder i was forced to change my mind. 
unlike other sony camcorders, first of all, it offers upto 40x zoom which is a lot. its a good use of your money. you can have it for under $400 and still works better than a lot of choices out there. easy to use, touch screen, takes still photos, has a good speaker so it's easier to record video and voice, fits into your palm so to speak, and if you use rewritable mini dvds, you wouldn't have to worry about go out of memory. 
 so when it comes to sony camcorders, i would say the better quality of this one would get the job done properly.

 This is my first digital camera. Prior to this I had a simple Kodak point-and-click model which pretty much the quality of a disposible.  I use much higher grade cameras at work both 35mm and digital.  This camera gives you the 5.1 MP ability though most shots only require the 3MP.  I like the 32MB internal memory though I've also bought a 256MB card for traveling. The 5x zoom isn't as cool as I initially thought it would be and digital zoom works sometimes and not others but you must understand what digital zoom really is.  The camera takes very clear and optimal pictures. Better pictures then I've taken on anything else I've owned before (and some of the work cameras as well).  The size is small enough to put in your pocket but not too small for one with larger hands. The different flash options and shooting scenes can turn difficult pictures into what you want to capture.   The panoramic shot sequence is an especially favorite feature especially for shoreline shots.  I've also bought the R-Series dock and enjoy its ability to transfer my pictures faster and charge two batteries at once.
  This camera is worth the price you pay but I believe its a 2005 model so it may not be the most up to date but it does a great job.

When I sow this in Amazon and read the spec. and everything on it I knew this is exactly what I'm looking for. It's portable, handy, and it's easy to use. The video has a great picture on it as well as the picture too. You can even download MP3 Music and use it to make music video, or any music of your own. Here's what you do,  Output the audio to a power Amp/ speaker so the performer will hear the music let the performer lipsink the music and start shooting the video. shoot different location at the same music and edit it whala you have just made the MTV Music Video

This camcorder is the best I have ever had!I have 5 others all higher and lower priced models for my business, I do video photography as one of my jobs. I love this camera, I dont know what would do without it! My kids can even operate it, we have made so many quality movies at home. I also use this camcorder for paid wedding and special occasion videos, it works great and I love the brand I really perfer it to others. Its not for you if you arent going to use alot or have a problem with the size, I dont think it's that big but then again I use some equipment thats enormous. This is not a palm Caamcorder. 
Once you figure out if this is the camera for you, you will be please, I enjoy it a lot!! There are descriptions of the camcorder, options and quality of the product on this page.
I love it and hope my short review helps. I know this is a non-detail review but all the info is on this page. This isnt for a person looking for a $400 dollar camera, if you want quality movies or use it for your job, ect. I really think this one is great! Hope this is useful, Camcorder Fanati

I had been searching web site after web site for a system like this.  I finally found a site where I could purchase seperate parts for a comparable system.  However, the receivers alone were more than this unit( If you wanted a receiver compatible with a plasma).  This works great.  Could not be easier to install.  All components are in my basement.  I ran the eye through the wall and have the eye barely exposed through a single cable face plate, with the blue led light taped to the back of the plate.  The blue light still shines through the faceplate, which is perfect. The faceplate is just below my wall mounted plasma set.  No interference.  This set up allows me to use this system at just about any angle in the room and the adjacent kitchen.  Works great with a basic $20 all in one ir remote. Also, the customer service is like no other.  I had several questions and each e-mail was answered by the next day with great help.  Made this purchase a no brainer. This is one product that far exceeded my expectations even after reading all the great reviews.  I highly recomend this product.

I have a wall hung plasma TV with speakers from my surround system mounted on either side. I was able to locate all the receivers in another room for a super clean installation. The Hot Pro IR target is very sensitive!! Initially I had the Hot Pro "box" too close to another TV and the blue indicator light was always on. If it's glowing, you need to move something. Once the indicator isn't lit but flashes when you use your remote, it works flawlessly

The only two drawbacks to this lens are that it requires a huge amount of light to take quality photographs and it is relatively slow to autofocus, especially where there is not adequate light.  Aside from this it is a good but not great lens.  It is probably worth the money that it cost, however, I believe that a better lens would be the 70 - 300 MM VR which costs about 4X the price of this lens

The GS150's performance is as-advertised. Terrific colour rendering, thanks to its 3-chip configuration. The camera also has the option of full manual control of standard settings, making it even more usable. Love the joystick! Still find it hard to believe that Panasonic has managed to fit all of this performance into such a small package.

Final Score: Engineering 1, Customer Service 0

Early production runs of this camera seem to have a shielding problem, which causes faint, red, horizontal bands to appear when recording in very low light conditions. Despite the fact this has been widely (if unofficially) reported by GS150 owners around the world, these same owners have noted that Panasonic customer service generally denies that the problem exists.

Thankfully, the problem is easily repaired by a certified technician. Better still, GS150 owners seem to have collectively deciphered that units manufactured from September 2005 onward are alright. Look for cameras with serial numbers beginning with 'H5' or higher. You can also read all about this at pana3ccduser dot com

I had to decide between this camera and a Panasonic.  we trust the Sony brand a little more, so we went with the Sony.  We were looking for an easy-to-use camera that we could just pick up and record our daughter...nothing professional but good enough quality to enjoy years later.  I also wanted a camera that could take still photos so we wouldn't need both a digital camera and a camcorder when we take vacations.  

Here's what I think so far:

Great camcorder to do exactly what we want -- picture looks great inside and out, VERY easy to use, and small enough to carry along almost anywhere.  

Still photos are not fantastic (only 3MP), but good enough for me.  Color and resolution are acceptable.    

Not easy to understand the LCD touch menus, but you can configure the buttons once you figure out which buttons you will use the most.

I got the bare minimums for accessories...bought a 1GB memory card (memory stick duo pro)...glad I did this since I will be taking stills and short video clips to email to the grandparents.  Also got a carrying case, DV tapes, and an extra NP-FP71 battery.  I'll be purchasing a firewire cable soon (I'm sure you've heard, the USB cable is inadequate for downloading video).  

Handycam station doesn't really bother me that much, but I can see what the fuss is about.  

All things considered, I'm extremely happy with my purchase.  I think this is a perfect camera for a first-time camcorder buyer who needs an EASY button (there's one on the side of the camera).  A little more expensive than some of the others, but the price is dropping.  

Best of luck!

I've owned the p-73 for about two years now.  One thing I'm noticing about a couple digital cameras in the amazon reviews, is that after a year or so, the camera has some kind of error or just dies completely.  For me, this hasn't happened with this camera.  It's always been great, and it has a lot of really convenient features.

When I bought this camera, I knew NOTHING about cameras.  I just wanted one really bad for some reason one day and went out and bought this one because it was PRETTY.  I got really lucky--I mean, I only bought it because it was pretty--I knew nothing about it.  But, nonetheless, I got lucky and bought this camera that takes AA batteries, came with a battery charger and its own USB cord.  It had a ton of settings on it.  Now that I understand more about photography, I really like the manual setting--the slowest shutter speed is 30 seconds compared to 10-15 seconds of even newer cameras in its class.

Like I said, i never had any problems with it.  Batteries always lasted long; took little time to recharge.  I never even bought a memory card for this camera--I use the lowest resolution to take pictures because that's all the given memory card can hold, and my pictures are still decent quality.

I'm now looking into a new camera because I do want excellent image quality, and, ironically, ever since I've been shopping for a new digital camera, my sony has been overexposing and underexposing about 20 percent of the shots i take; weird.

Anyway, if you're looking to buy a sony digital camera, based on my experience with this one, I'd recommend the brand

Through most of the 1990s, I lived overseas in both Europe and Asia.  Unfortunately, my number of photos from these times are limited to a handful as I hated looking like a "tourist" with my bulky camera!  Nowadays, I no longer have to worry about that because of cameras like this one!  I intially bought this T7 after using a friend's T1 and being impressed with the size of it.  The T7 is obviously considerably smaller, which is even better!  

I bought this camera right as they were coming out and paid well over $400 for it plus a 1GB Memory Stick Pro.  Both are investments that even to this day (over a year later) I am very happy with.  I have taken this camera just about everywhere and wherever I go people love to look at it.  I can say I've probably sold at least a dozen of these to people that fell in love with the size of the camera and the quality of photos it takes.  

As far as size, that is the biggest plus to it's advantage.  It can fit anywhere.  Even with the optional case that you can buy for it, it still easily fits in a trouser or jacket pocket, without even a noticable bulge.  

As far as photo quality goes, as most of the reviews note, the camera is very limited when it comes to night time shots.  I've found that these shots are often hit and miss as far as what you'll get, but for the size of the lens and the size of the flash, what can you expect?  After shooting a few thousand photos with this camera, I know what will be a good and bad night shot, and with the playback feature, you can quickly see the quality of your photo and retake if needed.  Is it perfect? No, but that's super tough in a camera this small.

Some reviews note the difficulty trying to take a photo while holding the camera still.  I've never had issue with this, but I could see how it could be an issue, it's just never one either my wife (the primary user) or I have dealt with.  I would venture that probably the vast majority of buyers of this camera will likewise not have a problem.

I've recorded more than a few .mpg movies with the camera and it surprisingly outperformed some of my bigger (and more expensive) point-and-shoot digital cameras.  I have been very pleased with that.  

Another drawback noted by many reviews is the LCD screen and the chance of breaking it.  I put a plastic screen protector (the thin plastic sheet type held by static) on it as soon as I bought it and haven't had a problem.  I've sat on the camera before (by accident, of course!) and have had it in luggage and the like, but have never had a problem.

The most significant drawback that I've had with the camera is that it can take more photos (esp with the 1GB card) than the battery will last.  Buy a second battery and you'll be more than good, but it's just something to keep in mind.

I would highly recommend this camera for anyone who travels, or anyone who wants a camera to take quick photos.  It can be carried anywhere and for the vast majority of shots, it's all that you need. I can say that we have many photos of our kids (and really good ones, too) that we would never had gotten if my wife didn't regularly carry this camera in her purse and diaper bag! I'm happy enough with it that I'm going to buy a second one for myself (especially now that the prices have dropped so much!) so that my wife can use our first one entirely for her own photography.  I give it five stars and would definately recommend it to others

Solidly built, this tripod balances well even when used with the heavier Sony Cybershots like the DSC-R1. The remote shuttle release button helps to further reduce camera shake, which is priceless when taking photos in conditions where camera shake is amplified (high optical zoom, supressed flash, etc).

What surprises me is the fact that the shuttle release button on the remote works exactly the same as any Sony Cybershot : press halfway to focus, and all the way down to capture the shot.

The zooming buttons do not work for the Sony DSC-R1 as the camera has a manual zooming ring, but they should work fine with any other Cybershot that comes with an electronic zoom and of course, an ACC terminal.

Highly recommended.

This is why sony is hot! This sexy little (yes its really small the size of a pack of cards) it takes perfect clear and crisp pictures and the battery life is a long 320mins perfect for a vacation, make sure to get a memory stick with it though, because w/o it it only holds about 15 pics. This is my first digital camera and I would definitely buy sony again

There some very detailed reviews, most of which I read before I ordered the camera from Amazon.  There is ample evidence that professionals will find the camera useful.  I want to take a minute to speak for the rest of us. The camera came a month ago and I've extremely happy with it.

Let me offer some perspective on my comments.  The last camera I bought was a small SONY shirt-pocket-sized camera that I was using alot and it got me back into taking pictures.  I decided that since I was taking so many pictures I wanted a camera that would take much better quality shots, WITHOUT my having to get a PhD in picture-taking.  I opted for this camera with the 18-200mm lens.  I now take the same pictures I took with the small camera, but with the zoom lens I can frame them better and with the 10.2 mega pixels I can blow them up and frame them. 

There are dozens (hundreds?) of features that I will grow into, but for now I am delighted to use this camera right out of the box, with just minimal reading of instructions.  Everything I remember from my 35mm days (my first camera was a Minolta SRT-101 that I bought in 1973) can be put to use, but what I forget, the camera remembers.

My point--this is a camera that is ready to meet you wherever you are and grow with you should you decide you want to go farther out and deeper in

5 stars...easy to use. The screen is large and clear. The automatic settings include a variety of scene selections (ie beach, party, fireworks scenes).  I have yet to use the video, so I cannot comment on that. I think this is a great all-around camera, and it fits in the smallest purses...big plus.  The screen has yet to get scratched in all my purse juggling.  

My only complaint would be in the shipping.  I paid extra to expedite my order since I was leaving the country a few days later. It was sent via UPS with a signature "in person" required.  When I missed UPS the first time, I was unable to just sign the paper and leave it on my door.  I had to contact UPS to find out when they would return so I could sign in person, which was an ordeal.  I wish I would've known that the camera was being sent this way.  I would've requested that no signature be required.

At first it was a little hard to get my pictures to look as good as the samples, but I found that by re-sizing them to about an inch or so on the computer before downloading them that they show up alot better. Also, the ones with higher contrast are easier to see farther away. Just look at the samples that come pre-loaded to remind yourself that it is possible to get great-looking pics at a surprisingly high resolution. After a few practice downloads I was thrilled with the results. **Another plus: this one came with a wall charger. Most have to be plugged in to the USB to charge. The wall charger makes it perfect to share on vacation when you're away from your computer

For less than $200 this is a great camera.  It is by no means spectacular, but for the price, it does a good job.  I own a Canon Powershot S60 as well, and the Canon outdoes this camera in some ways, but it's not pocketable.  The F20 is easy to use, the menu interface is fairly simple and self-descriptive, it powers up and is ready to take a picture quickly, and shutter lag seems average (close to the S60).  However, the only way to eliminate shutter lag is to buy a DSLR.  The "anti-shake" mechanism is not really useful at all, it merely boosts the ISO to 2000 which makes the image unprintable (at least indoors).  I have yet to try it this feature outside.  I've also found that dialing down the exposure compensation helps with the lowlights, especially outdoors.  Manually setting the ISO from 100-400 will, I hope, make for more printable, usable pictures.  I had actually thought of returning this little camera, but then realized that I could find nothing, for the price, that would be able to compete. I really wanted a 28mm lens, only found on more expensive models like the Canon sd800is, or Lumix's (which apparently have tons of noise at low ISO's).   It's pocketable, portable, and with a little tinkering you can get what you want from it.

I love this rangefinder- much better than the type that shoots the prism on the flag sticks.
You can use this one to find yardage to bunkers, creeks, etc. Very accurate and very useful. Well worth the money

It is light; has 6X magnification; and easy to use.  This little tool is great for any golfer.  You must know the yardage before you can select the correct club.  How far is it to either the top of that bunker next to the green or the flagstick?  Next,you just then need to pull the club that will get you there.  Fits on your belt through a loop in the safe carrying case or use the supplied clip to attached the case to your golf bag.  These NEW laser rangefinders are better than ever and at a lower price than previous models. LOVE IT

I got a Nikon laser rangefinder for Chrisymas and it had an 8x magnification. I found this to be to powerful for golf.I could not hold it steady on the flag.The 6x magnification on the Bushnell Yardage Pro Scout was much better. Also it is very compact and stores easily in my golf cart. The price from Amazon was well below I could find anywhere else.

I bought this camera as something a bit more capable, but not as expensive as an SLR. With a zoom equivalent to a 300 mm lens on an SLR, I certainly saved myself a heap of money over buying an SLR setup with the same capacities. 

I use this camera mostly in manual. That was my aim in buying it - to get more proficient in using the manual settings. A few times I have switched it to auto, and haven't been all that impressed. The autofocus seems a little unpredictable, but there is a single press manual focus button on the left side, as well as a focusing ring, and these do me very well indeed. I don't think I would recommend this camera to someone who wanted to use it mostly as a point and shoot. 

It loses one star mostly because of its poor macro capability. For really really good closeups it just doesn't come close to my Konica Minolta DImage Z6. 

I was a bit lost without image stabilization at first. This camera compensates for not having this by jacking up the film speed when in auto, and if I want to use it in manual and handhold, of course I have to do the same. Since I use a tripod a lot, this is not too much of an issue for me. I've heard a lot of bad press on the graininess at higher ISO, but I have found them to be at least as good as film if not better. 

The colors are great. I love my range of menu options, though there is nothing too extraordinary about them. This camera has more buttons than some, but once I got used to them, they make my selections so much faster when I am shooting in changing light conditions. 

I like the fact I can use a cable release with this camera. I have used it for quite a bit of low light work, and the fact that I can dial it right down to a twenty second shutter speed or even to B is fantastic.

I've found it pretty hard to find image editing software to work directly with raw images from this camera. 

It's working really well for me as a prosumer camera. However, I still think that if I could go back, I might go for a Panasonic DMC-FZ50 10.1MP instead. Maybe. I would have to check that one out more thorougly first

Well, I don't even know where to start for this camera. But about a year ago, when this camera first got launched to the digital camera market, it costed nearly twice as much as what you can pay for it now. For the price, this camera has alot to offer. I just love the color tone of Fujifilm. You get a very studio-like effect with Fujifilm CCD technology. This camera has many manual controls and features that will interest both professional and amature photographers. The 9 Megapixel can really be helpful when it comes to cropping. The pictures taken by this camera is bright and clear. The camera picture can be noisy if you set the ISO above 400. So, for the best result, just set the ISO level as low as possible (lets say ISO 80?). The 10.7X zoom lens is very convenient when you want to get close to the subject you are shooting. I used this camera for every occasion and it never failed me. I heard alot of complaints about the poor battery life of this camera, but just buy NiMH battery that is about 2500 mAh and above and you should get about 200-250 shots. Make sure to buy at least a 2 GB memory card because the picture files are pretty big, especially in RAW format. Also, for the price, this camera feels VERY SOLID in the hand. It feels very professional and sturdy (MADE IN JAPAN). The buttons are nicely placed and very easy to use. Make sure to buy an external flash if you want to do some serious light photography. I recommnend the Sunpak 383 non-dedicatted flash to go with this camera. It works together really well. Anyway, for $407, you cannot get a better camera than this one. Thank you Amazon for making this good deal possible. Again, I highly recommend this camera.

Solid construction, good optics, nice sound.  As mentioned by others, the output for the USB transfer is found in the handycam console and not the camera itself...a minor annoyance.  All in all, this is a good camera that is touch pricy but you do get what you pay for....

This is a very good camcorder with the main problem I noted being the DVD format giving only 30 minutes or so of recording in HD mode per disk. It is also a problem that only Blue-Ray DVD players can play back the DVD in HD mode. Even worse that it might destroy the disk if you use it on another player. Nevertheless, the price was good and I think Blue-Ray will be more affordable in the near future. Meanwhile, I can playback my video directly or send it to the computer. I am glad I bought it. If a MiniDV tape version were available at the same price now I think it might be better to stick with the tape version for now though. I was sent a bad power supply with the camcorder but Sony sent a new one right away. Be careful to buy the correct battery and external charger accessories for the camera as it is a bit confusing as to which will work for it. Overall - I am very happy with the camcorder

This camera delivers excellent video quality.

I use it with the hot-shoe attachable microphone and the audio is quite good.

I've plugged this into my HD television and the quality is excellent.  I have also had the Optura Xi from Canon and while the build quality of the HV20 is not quite as good as that of the Optura Xi, the video quality is nothing short of stunning.

This is a very good deal for $1000.  You won't be disappointed

I mainly use the camcorder for recording my kids.

I bought this camcorder a couple of weeks ago.  I had the sony hc-7 before for a couple of weeks which I returned to buy the canon camcorder.  

The high light performance of both camcorders are excellent.  With the sony camcorder, I felt that the best color performance can be achieved by reducing the color intensity.  The low light performance when recording 1080i is similar for the two camcorders but much better with canon when recording in 24p format.  This is the main reason that I prefer the canon.  The 24p recording is more sensitive to motion which can be a problem if recording motion.

The still images from canon are lower resolution but to me they looked better than sony.  This is especially true when taking flash pictures.  
The sony seems a little better built.  The hdmi cover on canon is poorly built.

I liked the controls on canon better than sony.
The auto focus and automatic white balance worked better in canon than in sony.  The auto white balance in sony worked poorly in indoor light.

Sony has supershot infrared recording and canon does not.

Sony has more manual controls than canon.

My Canon HV20 WOW Moments!

You can't beat the HD picture quality from the HV20 based on actual user reviews and comparisons with all of the latest models. While this is a single CMOS sensor, it is a true 1920 x 1080 HD sensor of the same quality found in the award winning Canon Digital SLR cameras. Don't be fooled by a 3CCD camcorder that uses smaller sensor sizes and must use "pixel shifting".

I had already hooked up the HV20 to my 720p projector, and it did look great even at my typical 120". But I do know that my projector probably isn't calibrated very well to be honest.

So, my first WOW moment came when I decided to capture some of my best outdoor footage from my Canon Elura stock and compare it to some HV20 footage shot of my kids over the weekend at an Easter egg hunt. WOW, the difference in quality was even more pronounced than I realized. I guess that the resolution difference is what it is, but this is definitely serious HD quality.

The real defining WOW moment that has me "selling" all of my family and friends on this camcorder came last night when I hooked it up at my brother-in-law's house to his Sony Wega CRT HDTV display that does 1080i and is calibrated to perfection. You won't find a higher quality HD display than his set IMO, and my jaw dropped when my video first came up on his display  That was the first time when I was truly able to see what my source footage was capable of in terms of its full resolution and AMAZING colors. We switched to Discovery HD on his set, and other than obvious production value aspects you honestly couldn't really say that it looked any more HD than the footage of my kids playing.

This is way more exciting to me than when I first saw broadcast HD and watched Monday Night Football because it is hard to describe how cool it is to see your kids on video in beautiful HD for a $1,000 price point. I can hardly wait to get out there and shoot some more footage.

This review is for the Coolpix 5900 with 5MP. 
You will not be displeased with this camera if you are in the 
market for a compact digital camera. This little baby lies 
comfortably in your pocket until you want it and rarely fails 
to deliver, no matter what lighting obstacles you throw in it's 
path. The footprint is amazingly small for a 5MP and you'll be 
amazed at the functionality. I found the video/movie feature to 
be a real useful tool that surprises most people with the great 
clarity and utterly blown-away at night shots in poor light. 
Think of Las Vegas lights on the strip, or a crowd of people 
in thin night light. This camera handled it all. The SD card 
is easy to access, and I recommend a 1GB size so you can take 
your time with movies. Otherwise a 512MB card will give you 
about 300 photos. But I warn you, you will be bitten by the 
movie bug and want to use this more and more (provided you have 
disk space or burn the excess to DVDs). I also recommend the 
San Disk Ultra II SD cards for fast recovery speeds, so you 
don't have to wait for each shot to record before going to the 
next shot (this is 5 MP and that's a lot of pixals to store). 
The roll on the side of the body enables you to keep a tight 
grip on it with one hand shots- a feature many small cameras 
lacked. The battery life is exceptional, but as always, buy a 
backup for travel. The hit of one star was for the frustratingly small on/off button. I know they designed it so that it won't accidentally turn on in your pocket, but my fat finger is not the best tool.... The 2 inch LCD is not protected like others too, but so far seems pretty tough, rolling around in my pocket with sunglasses and other things that so far have not scratched it.

I have a Canon EOS Rebel which takes fantastic pictures.  I use it around home and when I am setting up static shots such as family portraits.  The only problem is...who wants to lug it around to take snapshots.

Despite some of the above opinions about lack of sharpness, I have had no such problems.  The 5900 is great for "grab" shots and it's not too shabby for setting up a planned shot using it's advanced controls. 

Be sure that you buy a FAST memory card.  This will reduce the time between shots.  As in most cameras, a memory card is not supplied with the camera.  Mr. Goyal's review about not being able to take pictures without a memory card is not true.  You can take a LIMITED number of shots with the internal memeory. 

The only real problem I have is the red-eye reduction feature.  I usually turn it off as the delay between the "red-eye" flash and the main flash is too long.  The subjects often think the shot is over and start to move.  Anyway it is easy enough to remove it later, either with photo-software or with the photo kisok in the drug store

Got this camera in 1999 and it is still doing very well!  More than 3000 great pictures have been taken.  The camera is very easy to use and needs no maintenance.  A word of caution - ensure that the camera doesn't get pressurized laterally - this can happen if it is stuffed in a bag and someone sleeps over it.  The spring-operated shutter is very sensitive.

Would recommend this for anyone who is looking for a cost-effective and easy-to-use film camera

This is a nice bag, but don't buy it for a Canon S2 IS it will not fit.  The product compatibility lists the S1 IS since the S2 and S1 are very similar I purchased this bag.  I can't even get the thing in the bag.  It is a nice bag however and have put my smaller Kodak camera in it.  There is plenty of room for a typical point and shoot camera and all of it's accessories.  Good quality

Its a cable, it works, what else do you want?  I know its not the cheapest one out there, but this one says "sony" on it.  Yea!!  But, I am a true believer that you only get what you pay for.  Im sure its better quality than the five dollar version at the flea market.  who knows, but I sure feel all warm and fuzzy about getting quality sony products.

This is my second digital camera. Although it does so much more than my first, it is much easier to operate. I especially love the fact that I can video my grandson's baseball game, and then convert individule frames to photos (jpeg) with great quality. I have a series of photos with him getting a hit. It looks great!

Thanks for a great product.

This product delivers exactly as promised and we could not be more pleased.  The pictures are wonderful.  The initial downloading process was straighforward and problem-free. We actually purchased three photo frames for ourselves and our children and they love them as much as we do.  The slideshow feature is wonderful as well. Everyone of our friends that have seen the photo frame are equally amazed by this product as some were not aware that such a product even existed. To be sure, they are expensive but worth the cost.  We will enjoy our photo frame for years to come as we update with new pictures regularly.  Thanks to the folks at Philips for getting this soooooooooooo right.

We just got this camera after much research.  The camera is easy to use and we like it but frustrated that it doesn't do some of what was advertised.  For the most part tho for the price and all it is fine.  Just read all the directions and don't be to disappointed if it doesn't play your old 8 mm tapes and a few other things like that.
I wrote to Sony and they said that this model doesn't do a few things.  SO MAIN POINT HERE IS READ AND READ AND KNOW WHAT IT IS.

I liked the service we received thru Amazon.  No problems ther

Do not expect this to replace the zoom from your camera. It will not do that nor was it intended to do so. What it does do is optically bring things a little bit closer. This is certainly preferably to using the digital zoom that comes with so many cameras. 

The lens works by screwing into the end of the camera lens where filters would normally be put. This means that it is something which must be planned for to be used. It is not to be put on while filming is taking place; it is in place when filming begins. Since it is easy to use, this should not take too long. The normal zoom of the camera can be used while this lens is in place. Having it in place just changes the limits from a little bit closer to what would normally be the case to not quite as far when the camera is zoomed out to maximum. Care should be taken not to get this lens cross threaded when putting it in place.

The quality of the optics seem to be fine. I used it on a Sony DCR-VX2100 and had no problems.

This is a handy gadget to have handy in your case but be aware of what it will and will not do.

I purchased this battery as a back-up to the one that came with the camcorder. The great thing about this is, once charged, it can sit in a camcorder for a month without loosing any power. I discovered this last week when I wanted to use the camcorder and was worried that the battery may be dead by now but ...surprise surprise. Its recharge time is very fast.

The only negative part (if I must have to give) is, it's a little bigger then the one that comes with camcorder.

I say go for it.

This case is the perfect size to hold our Sony Camcorder and a few blank tapes.  We purchased it for a cruise, because we wanted to carry-on the camcorder and have it protected, but not have to lug the large case we owned that holds all the accessories.  This smaller case still protects the camera and allows room for some extras

This is a very flexible and capable camera. If you are looking for more than a point & shoot will offer, there are very few that would compare. For me the deciding factor was the high quality lieca lens with wide angle, if you havent compared this directly with a conventianal lens you will be amazed at what youve been missing. the 16:9 is an ok feature if you plan on HDTV veiwing but the screen size is compromised when you switch to 4:3. i would prefer a larger screen and lose the 16:9 feature. the lens cap is a little annoying as well but those issues aside, i am very satisfied

At least for now it is :-) .  During the course of the past 10-12 months I have owned 7, that's SEVEN, digital cameras: Canon S230; Kodak V530; 5 different models of Casio's: Z60, Z600, Z850, P700; and most recently presented my wife with a red S770 for Valentine's Day.  I also had a pretty good chance to evaluate Canon SD450 (my brother-in-law owns one - it was actually a gift from my wife and I to him for his 21st birthday), Casio EX-S600 (a good friend of mine owns one), and Panasonic DMC-TZ1 (once again, a gift from my wife and I to my father-in-law for his last birthday).  If you read any of my digital camera reviews (and I've written a few by now), then you know that I'm not particularly fond of Canon's lately - I think they are overrated and overpriced for what they have to offer.  As I also mentioned before, I've tried several different Kodak models (and I used to work for the company too!), but all of them turned out to be a waste of my time, to say the least.  I became a big fan of Casio's, although not all of my experiences with them were great.  But being a huge gadget "freak" that I am, and constantly wanting new "toys", I have always craved for more.  Over time, my tastes in digital cameras have changed from having a simple point and shoot type of camera to wishing for more power and manual control.  So one by one, I returned/sold all of my cameras, and after extensive (and I really do mean extensive) research, I got myself an LX2.  I must say though that I probably wouldn't have without getting to know my father-in-law's TZ1 first.  I was actually quite impressed with it.  Powerful zoom, sharp lens, decent picture quality.  I also played with some other Panasonic models in various stores just to get a better feel for them, as well as spent a few hours on the phone, and exchanged numerous e-mails with a friend of mine who owns an FZ30, and who swears by it.  Unfortunately, LX2 was not available anywhere locally, but I felt that I got a pretty good understanding of what Panasonic's cameras are all about, and after some more thought and consideration, I went ahead and bought it from Amazon (nice thing about buying from Amazon is that you can always return whatever it is you bought, including digital cameras, within 30 days for a full refund, no questions asked).  I did know about the "Noise" issue at high ISO's, but it wasn't a decisive factor for me, and I'm glad I didn't pay much attention to it and got the camera anyway.  It turned out to be one of the best purchases I've made in a long while.  Here is why:

PROS:
- Superb design.  This camera is wonderfully crafted.  And I absolutely love Black!  It gives the camera a nice, clean, professional look.  I don't think I'll be buying another silver camera soon after having this one;

- Intuitive controls, and menus.  I charged the battery, put it into the camera, and started using it and taking pictures right away, without even going through the manual once;

- A load of features, including a large, bright, widescreen LCD; wide angle, super sharp Leica lens with a 4x zoom; Mega OIS - optical image stabilization control (optical means it's done mechanically, which is a TRUE way of doing stabilizing, comparing to other cameras where it's done by "tricking" the camera into using higher ISO's); and many more.  In addition, it has a joystick for an easy access to different menus, has a number of manual controls, as well as provides ability to shoot in RAW format (more on that later);

- It comes with SilkyPix Developer Studio software for working with camera RAW files.  For someone who is not familiar with RAW - it's a "pure", camera specific picture format.  It varies upon a manufacturer, meaning that Canon RAW is different from Nikon or Panasonic RAW, for example.  And it's "pure" in a sense that it's of a much better quality than a standard JPEG (JPG), and doesn't suffer from loss of information, such as white balance, or brightness.  There is a lot more to RAW than that, and I'm not going to go into details right now.  What I want to say, however, is that having previously owned a camera which supported RAW format (Casio EX-P700), I must have tried about a dozen of different RAW editing software packages, including products from Adobe, Ulead, ArcSoft, PhotoFiltre, Picture Window Pro, ACDSee, LightZone, Image Broadway, and more. SilkyPix delivered by far the best results of all.  The only one that I would probably put next to it is Bibble;

- Noise - What Noise?!  I really hate it when I hear people complaining about noise in this camera (after having it tried myself), or any other compact digital camera for that matter.  Are you really that nave that you think that you will get absolutely no noise in your images using a compact digital camera?  Think again.  You might have noticed that I've used the word "Compact" several times here.  I've done it on purpose - it is inevitable for a compact digital camera to produce some noise.  Some cameras are better than others, but no matter how hard you try, you will see some.  This camera is no better or worse than any other one that I've had/tried.  At higher ISO's (above 400), it's slightly more visible, but who in the right state of mind is using anything over ISO 200 on a compact digital camera, such as this one, anyway?  I always have mine set to a 100.  If I feel that it doesn't get the job done, I shoot in RAW;

- Picture Quality is Very Good.  Yes, it does take some time getting used to, but once you familiarize yourself with everything this camera is capable of, you can achieve spectacular results, especially if you don't mind doing some post processing.

As much as I like everything this camera has to offer, there are, however, some things that kind of irritate me.  Here is a short list of bad things about this camera, otherwise known as

CONS:
- First of all, this camera has actually been somewhat misrepresented.  It's been advertised as a 10.2 megapixel camera, which is not entirely true.  10.2 MP resolution is available ONLY in 16:9 (wide) aspect ratio.  Two more ratios are available - 3:2, and a more conventional 4:3, but those offer 8.5, and 7.5 MP resolutions respectively.  So if you compare this camera to others that don't have a widescreen format, or if you prefer to shoot only in a regular 4:3 mode, then this camera should only be referred to as a 7 MP digital camera (because not all the pixels are actually effective).  Obviously, Panasonic is aware of it, and marketed it having higher pixel count on purpose, to boost consumer's interest;

- I expected to see a compact digital camera.  What I got instead was actually a smaller compact camera than I expected.  I was really surprised to see how small, yet convenient to hold and operate, the camera body was.  What I didn't like, however, was the lens.  Not the lens itself, it's actually quite superb, but the fact that it sticks out.  I like cameras with lenses that retract all the way back to the camera body.  I realize that it would probably loose some features, like the wide angle, and perhaps zoom, but I still wish it did that.  It would be so much more... umm... compact?!  The way it actually is makes it quite difficult to find the right case for it.  Almost impossible, I should say.  I've tried a few, but they are either too small or too big.  I just can't find one that would fit right.  I put an order for an SLX1B case for it, which is specifically designed to fit LX1, and LX2 models, but I hear they are not that good.  We shall see;

- I'm not a big fan of a pop-up Flash.  I always keep forgetting to open it when I need to use it.  And it also seems a bit flimsy.  I'm treating it as carefully as I can, but I just can't stop thinking that it might break soon;

- I hate the Lens Cap!!!  There, I said it.  It's probably just one of those small annoyances that keep frustrating you until you get used to it, but for now I'm not really happy with it.

SUMMARY:
Despite very few minor negatives, I think LX2 is probably one of the best, most innovative cameras on the market today, and I sure am glad to have one.  It offers more than any other camera in the same price range, and can even compete with some DSLR's when it comes to picture quality.  If you are someone like me, who wants to have more control and/or learn more about digital photography, or a DSLR user who just needs a solid backup to carry everywhere, then this camera is not be overlooked!  Highly recommended

This tripod arrived on time and in good condition. However I have to put the "heavy duty" in quotations as this item is for amateurs mostly and is made of plastic as well. The weight you can put on it is limited. However it does the job well for the amateur photographer or videographer

This is a great camera. The quality is good and the camera is very durable. I've accidently dropped the camera several times, and it still works. However, I would suggest getting a memory card if you want to take more than 24 pictures at a time.

I owned a Kodak for awhile and was pleased with the pictures however, my husband accidently fell while ice skating and broke my camera.  My family, knowing I love to take pictures, decided to replace my camera, but this time with a Sony Cybershot.  I have never been more unhappy with a camera.  Needless to say, I finally decided to purchase this Kodak Z650 and am so pleased with the results and pictures.

I am not a professional photographer, just someone who likes to take photos of my kids, pets, flowers, vacation spots, etc.  My Sony was HORRIBLE at action shots and if you had ANY movement what so ever, the photo appeared blurry.  Having kids, that isn't an option.  I gave that camera to my daughter to do whatever she wanted with it.  The Kodak, however does a wonderful job of action shots as well as clear, crisp and concise pictures.  I absolutely love this camera!  

I will never go back to another brand and have only good things to say about Kodak and their products

I bought this camera to replace my 35 almost a couple years back.  I am an avid nature photographer so most of my work is taken in the outdoors.  After hundreds of pictures and all kinds of weather here's the lowdown...

Pros ... Picture quality is amazing even after zooming the full 10X (I never go into digital zoom because of low quality of pictures, although this camera isn't too bad after complete full optical and digital zoom).  Prints that I've made up to 16X20" (haven't gone larger, but I know I can) are extremely impressive and are as crisp as viewing a 4x6.  It is easy to use and the functions are easy to get to with the use of the joystick.  The stabilization at full 10X zoom is incredible also.  It appears really shaky through the window, but pictures continue to turn out crisp.  Close-ups are clear and reveal amazingly clear details.  The movie feature works better indoors than the regular camera portion (read cons).

Cons ... Indoor shooting is limited because the flash isn't strong enough.  When at a school chorus concert, the pictures turned out fuzzy and unclear.  Award ceremonies, the pictures turned out once again unusable in my standards.  The zoom is fixed when using the movie feature so you need to have the zoom set before beginning a movie.  This camera seems to eat batteries, especially in the winter months.  I am always on the go, and when I go to pull out the camera I find the camera lens cover has fallen off yet again.  It comes off way to easily causing smudges and smears on the lens so I must always have lens cleaner wipes on me.  The viewing window cover has also come off and is lost in the woods somewhere, but that also is minor.

Most of the cons really are all minor things that don't interfere with the amazing quality of the pictures as long as you are properly prepared for those minor issues.  I tried to be as precise about this camera as possible.  All in all, I would highly recommend this camera to the avid photographer.  If you plan on using a camera on mostly indoor activities, just keep in mind for the flash to work good, keep your subjects close.  It's been bumped, jostled, and droped a couple of times and the camera still works like a gem

If you use the viewfinder instead of the LCD field, it does not appear on the LCD, you can only see it through the viewfinder.  This is different from previous models.  Minor annoyance.

The quality of the videos was surprisingly good, but it saves them in the QuickTime .Mov format.  Mov is not my favorite format, but perhaps others will not be bothered by this.  

Although I had heard that the color on Kodaks is not natural, I have found it to be excellent.  The overall quality of the pictures is good.  

For the price, I think this is a very good value and adequate for most casual photographers.

I stumbled across this little gem by accident.  I was picking up supplies at Office Depot and they had a Kodak Z650 (display model) on sale for under $100. It was a ridiculous impulse buy--I already own 4 digital cameras ... the last thing I needed was another camera! But what a delighful suprise this camera turned out to be! It's come the closest to rivaling the image quality of my old Olympus C-740. 

I had never seriously looked at Kodak cameras ... I always steered clear of them based on bad press and negative comments about them from my friends who are "serious" photographers. 

But I couldn't be happier with this little bargain ... it basically serves the need I wanted to fill -- a 6mp camera that takes the kind of quality shots I was used to with my C-740.

There are a few negatives in that it can be a little slow in processing the shots, but there is very little shutter-lag when taking the shots. I've gotten some amazing birds-in-flight shots with it--something I've never been able to accomplish with any of my other cameras, including the C-740. Some low-contrast shots come out a bit noisy, but for the most part the shots are very crisp and sharp. It handles low-light settings better than any of the others in this class that I've tried. 

At less than a third of the price of my Canon S2-IS, this little camera outclasses the others by a mile.

I stumbled on to a good find in the Z650 ... it's not going to give you DLSR quality photos, but no point-and-shoot will.  

This camera is perfect for any one who likes to take great outdoor and wildlife shots.  I just wish someone would have given a good report on Kodak cameras before I spent a small fortune on the others

The Bushnell Powerview 12x25 is a fine, small pocket-sized binocular.  Since my wife is an avid bird watcher, we already have several binoculars of various sizes and viewing power.  Our grandson accidentally broke her small 10x25 Bushnell that we used for trips, so I researched, then bought this one from Amazon for her birthday.  She loves it.  The viewing power is a bit greater than the other and is every bit as compact, which makes it easy to pack for vacations, yet provides for a good viewing experience when enjoying the various bird populations around the country.  We both highly recommend this, and other Bushnell products

I was using this lense for a week now with D50 and I can tell you that in low light indoor shooting this lense is AWESOME. At 1.8f this lense should be fast enough for any semi-profesional (like myself). At 8f this lense produces the most sharpest photo ever and given that you shoot in NEF (RAW) format and use photo editor software (I use Nikon's Capture NX) photoes become master pieces. At 22f, outside group portrait are sharp to the last hairy detail on each single person. I highly recommend this lense

I was looking to expand my lens collection without breaking my budget and found this 50mm to be an excellent first choice. I love being able to shoot in low light situations which this lens has allowed for me to do. However, the auto-focus leave a lot to be desired as far as speed and accuracy goes. I've found leaving it in manual focus allows me to get more shots faster, at least in low light.

I would recommend this to anyone looking for a way to take video and pictures without the hassle of lugging around (and charging) two separate gadgets.  It takes excellent pictures, just as good if not better than any other digital camera I have seen.  I am also very pleased with the video - I found the software very user friendly and video was easy to transfer and edit on my computer.  The battery has a good life, I have had no problems having to stop and recharge it.  There is a nite mode that compensates (very well, I think) for low light video.  The camera is easy to carry around (it is smaller than my 35mm) and I am having no problems with the functionality - all in all a great idea and easy to use with great pictures and great video

I have no complaints. I have had this camera for over a year and a half and it has been reliable, fast, and gives me crisp, quality photos! The only option I wish this camera had was a better stabilization mode to prevent blurred pictures, but the software edits the blur without reducing the quality. Blurry pictures are not a problem as long as you know how to aim and shoot. Everyone loves playing with my camera because it has many cool features to make your photos fun! I highly recommend this camera (especially to beginners or for those who just want a simple camera that can capture those precious moments, with high quality photos). Excellent camera overall! ;

The beauty of this charger is that it is 110/220v compatable, so with the appropriate international connector you can charge your batteries on European voltage.  I have used two of these with the plug adapters and have kept four sets of batteries charged overnight for two olympus cameras giving a day plus of batteries available for each.  Very few cheap US chargers offer this multi voltage compatability.  Lots cheaper than multiple voltage convertors.  If you plan on traveling internationally, this charger is a must!

I have been using Kodak cameras for years. This is my third Kodak digital camera. It does everything, including taking excellent close-up wildlifephotos. It is as easy to use as a point and shoot. However, it does have all the bells and whistles needed for a professional style camera. It is well worth the money. Look no further this is the camera for you

I bought these Binoculars for my Dad for Christmas, and he is absolutely in love with them.  The distance it can handle is slightly above average, but the clarity is really where this thing shines.  Its very easy to use, and has held up reasonably well.  I would recomend it to the casual user

I got this camera so I could have more control.  I'm learning to use the shutter and aperture settings...I haven't explored all the fancy settings much, but there are tons of them.  I really like the continuous shooting option so I'm more likely to catch a good action shot.  The wide-angle lens has also allowed me to get some pretty cool shots and the macro settings work great for close-ups.  I think it's one of the best buys you can find if you want to take some pretty cool photos, but don't feel quite ready for an SLR

This is a must have item for your kodak dig. camera.
It allows for filters, tele/wide aux lenses or any 55mm screw on attachment.
Apart from that the black metal enclosure compleatly covers the entire lens assemby, at any zoom or focal length.
This adds a very strong and valuable protection to your lens.
If you accidentally bang the camera against a hard surface this adapter may very likely save your lens (camera) from destruction.  I always keep it on with a skylight filter, the skylight or a UV filter further protects the lens from impact, scratches and dust.  If used when the lens is not fully extended ex: wide angle to normal zoom, the adpter also helps block out stray light and acts as a light shade. Kodak aught to have this built into their camera as a permanent fixture, but alas they make extra revenue on their accessories.
Do Buy It!

Seems Panasonic has finally dropped the hammer on the pseudo DSLR market, with 420mm at 12x or 749mm - 21.4x at 3mp is outstanding especially with OIS. excellent pictures out of the box, menu operations are plentiful, NR can be reduced and the jog dials front and back for Aperture or shutter is very professional.

Leica lens is crisp and sharp, I shoot in Aperture priority with NR at minimal and the pictures even in Jpeg look like they have been post processed, simply amazing.

After experiencing this camera I sold my Nikon D80, attachment lens and soft pictures Nikon was giving me is unacceptable, i went thru every menu option including using the much hyped RGB3 which by the way gives cartoon colors has no comparison to the Panasonic.

High speed USB is my only complaint for data transfers, Noise reduction for higher ISO noise is a bit over powering but acceptable but controllable at your liking, a 3" ,screen would be nice but maybe on the next model.

BTW, moon shots with the Raynox 2020 at 3mp give a zoom of 47.08x optical or 1647 mm optical, hand held shots with OIS (image stabilization) enabled gives jaw dropping pictures, you actually have a telescope with OIS at your reach, simply amazing.

100% satisfied.

This is my third digital camera and by far my favorite. I purchased after having a very versatile but large (well large in the dimensions of digital cameras) digital camera. I needed and wanted a camera that I could easily carry w/ me at all times. This is perfect.

The Fugi Z1 fits easily into your pocket or a small case for easy access. Just don't put anything else in that pocket! The one time I forget and did this I noticed a large scratch on the silver portion of the camera.

As with all digital cameras this one takes much better pictures in good lighting. I have found, however, that this tiny camera has an excellent flash so I am still able to get good interior shots if I am willing to blind people (or my cats) for a few seconds.

The camera comes w/ a docking station that I have found very useless for uploading pictures but you have to use it to charge the camera. I tend to just use a USB cable direct to the computer or a really cheap USB card reader that I can attach directly to my computers USB port.

I took this camera to Japan and it was great. I only had one day where I ran out of battery power but that was my own fault.

This is a highly recommended camera by me

This is NOT a high-tech digital frame. It doesn't play MP3's.  It doesn't come with a remote.  It simply reads your digital pictures from a card and displays them in a slide show mode.  There's an "on" button and an "off" button.  There is no manual to read in order to learn how to operate your frame (though it does come with a one-page instruction sheet).  It's great for your office desk when all you need to do is reach over and turn it on or off.  If you want to display it in a difficult-to-reach location, or choreograph your pictures with music, then this is not the frame for you

I decided I wanted this a while before i got it. As I read reveiws I realized majority of them were postive. There is nothing wrong with it, the microphone works really good but you can not watch your videos with sound on the camera. It can take around 300 some pictures and about 60 minutes of video on Super sine mode, where it uses the most megapixels. It is definetly something I would recommend for anyone

purchased as a gift and well received.  seems to handle larger chips in a timely manner.  runs everyday, all day and no problems encountered.  displays vacation pictures clearly.  like that it is big enough to view across the room.  frame is more compatible with decore than the 7" model previously purchased

I purchased the Axion 10.4" frame for my wife to replace a defective Polaroid frame from a different source.  The Axion stacked up quite nicely to the other "more expensive" frame.  The Axion is viewable from more angles than the Polaroid frame with a cheaper price tag.  Quality of the display is BETTER on the Axion and we have not had any technical issues.

PROS:
Brightness control
Color and Contrast of display
Ease of setup and operation
Good sound from speakers on music playback

CONS:
Slide show transitions are from top to bottom only.  Different transitions would be a nice feature.
Remote does not control volume of music.

Overall the advantages of this frame outweigh the disadvantages.  We have been very happy overall with this purchase

This is NOT a high-tech digital frame. It doesn't play MP3's.  It doesn't come with a remote.  It simply reads your digital pictures from a card and displays them in a slide show mode.  There's an "on" button and an "off" button.  There is no manual to read in order to learn how to operate your frame (though it does come with a one-page instruction sheet).  It's great for your office desk when all you need to do is reach over and turn it on or off.  If you want to display it in a difficult-to-reach location, or choreograph your pictures with music, then this is not the frame for you

I am pleased with the purchase.  Very good value.  Picture quality is good and it is easy to operate.  Only negative is that it was advertised as wood frame when in fact it is plastic.  However, it looks good.  This is my second purchase of this product: one for myself and one as a gift

Well, I'm just amazed this model is still in production the way things are changing so quickly in the A/V world.

I bought mine two years ago and have recorded many hours of my children as they are growing up.  This is a truly low maintenance and low cost solution for your video recording needs if you don't have a lot of money to spend on a digital set-up.   

Just buy and extra after market battery or two (and they're cheap) and some inexpensive analogue tape, and start recording away!

After you climb the learning curve, of course.  My one problem with this camcorder is that the controls are anything but intuitive, and they're splattered all over the unit.  Be sure to read the user manual carefully before you try to use this thing, but once you've got it down you'll find this a trusty and low cost companion for your family vacations and holidays.  

Oh yeah, almost forgot, the microphones aren't stereo but they're really quite good for an entry level unit

One of the reviews I read before purchasing these suggested that the reviewer should've had them for her Celine Dion concert.  I took the suggestion and they were perfect!  They fit nicely in my evening bag and brought Celine closer to me as I sat in the Second Mezzanine at Caesar's Palace!  Not only that - but the price was right! I couldn't be happier!  Plus, now I have them for our next trip to Rocky Mountain Park to get up close and personal to some wildlife

I really wanted a 3CCD model, but since I'm just starting out and need to buy other stuff, like a tripod, monopod, media, firewire adapter card, camera bag, etc. This fits the budget nicely and it is compact enough to carry it anywhere. Yes the USB connection does work, yes FireWire does work, although it took me a minute to figure out that a connection problem was the fault of the video software version I was using, not the fault of the camera

This is a well made head constructed of solid metal with a nice finish.  There are no plastic parts and even the rubber piece on the quick release plate is hard rubber.  I have used it every week for about two years and have had no problems with it.  I use it mainly attached to a monopod for sports photography and videography.  The quick release has a clever locking mechanism to prevent accidental release.  I bought an extra quick release plate so I can switch between two cameras.

Tilt only -- no swivel:  Amazon (and others including Bogen) calls it a Swivel Tilt Head, but that seems to imply that it moves in two directions -- tilting (up and down) and swivelling (side to side or panning).   This head only moves in the tilting direction which allows you to orient the camera in either landscape or portrait modes.

The tilting action could be improved if the head clicked into the upright position when you tilt it back to landscape.  When you are going to the portrait mode, there's no problem since it stops at 90 degrees.  However, when I want to go back to landscape, I have to hold it out and look at it to see if it's level.  A subtle click to know I'm there would be nice

I am really enthusiastic about this lens because it is an excellent accessory for my camera at a very convenient price.  I add it and use it for landscapes, mountain views, nature images and such, and also for group pictures in family photos.   It does what is supposed to do: it increases the field of view while keeping the whole image very clear, and in this way the pictures appear more natural -- a whole view and not a narrow frame -- with perspective and deepness also, quite similar it seems to me to what I see with my own eyes.   A very useful additional tool

I purchased this camera brand new for a fraction of the price of my first digital camera.  This is my second point and shoot digital camera since I have abandoned film.

It is a very solid and durable and it takes beautiful pictures.  It has almost no shutter lag time and the battery has never run out on me.  I have used it on an entire week long vacation without re-charging it.

Kodak keeps making these cameras better and more reliable for less

I have to get on the bandwagon here.  This is a superb little camera, definately five stars!  I also have the TZ1, which showed promise, but has  limitations. In my review of the TZ1, I noted it had lots of "noise" and pictures shouldn't be printed much beyond 4x6 inches if they were to be sharp.  I also wanted more manual controls.

The TZ3 fixes and improves almost everything about the TZ1 and adds some new, very useful features.  The noise has been drastically reduced, the lens is better, the sensor is bigger, and the processor is not only faster, but produces better pictures.  The TZ3 adds a very handy "function" button - or I should say function capability - the number of buttons is the same - which gives immediate access to five or so "most used" settings without having to go into the menues - of which there are several.

The TZ3 keeps the Mega Optical Image Stabilization and adds Intelligent ISO, increases the sensitivity without adding noise,(I have not tried the 3200 setting yet.), increases the size of the viewing screen, etc., etc.

The TZ3 is a "well-rounded," and very capable camera.  There is simply no comparison between the TZ1 and the TZ3 as far as the quality of the pictures.  The TZ3 wins hands down.  In my opinion it also beats some big name, higher priced digicams - a couple of which I own - rather handily. 
 
Of course, the big selling point for the TZ3 is still the 10X lens - now with wide angle capability - on a pocket-sized point and shoot camera.  This lens is SHARP, and combined with larger sensor and the new processor yields some excellent results.

While there are no manual controls, per se, the camera seems to do very well without them.  Pictures are sharp, exposures seem nicely done (haven't tried it at night yet, but low light forrest shots were excellent), colors were accurate, appropriately saturated, and vivid (OK.  I like the vivid setting.), good contrast, etc.  There are a variety of AF settings, settable focal points, and focus modes.  There is also exposure compensation, and exposure bracketing available - and they work well!  The live histogram is a welcome bonus.  The TZ3 focuses down to about 2 inches in macro mode - again with excellent, sharp results.  The TZ3 is very well speced out.  

One nice thing that is gone is the lens cap on the TZ1.  It was  really not to inconvenient, but seemed always to be swinging in the wind to add yet another source of camera shake.  The TZ3 lens includes an built in lens cover.  Very welcome.

I currently own five top flight digicams (including this one), and have owned about that many others, I am most impressed with this one - for combined convenience and results.  It is a quantum step forward.

I also have a couple of quite nice, and fairly complete DSLR kits.  They are wonderful, and in a class by themselves, but when I want very nice pictures and the convenience of a pocketable point and shoot with a 10X, wide angle lens, or a back up for the DSLRs, the TZ3 is now my camera of choice.

I went to Ritz Camera today and took a good look at the TZ3. I'll tell you, its pretty nice. The build quality is really  good, as a previous person mentioned. The body is metal. The dials and buttons click with precision, and have a nice resistance. It has a nice weight to it.

I took some nice shots in the store. I must have clicked off 100 pics. I'm impressed with it. If you want something relatively small, powerful and tough, this camera is for you. The 10x zoom is great, but on such  a small camera it is difficult to hold it steady enough(at least for me) to use the zoom too much. 

I love the build quality and style, so I may be biased. It's a nice piece of equipment. I cannot speak to the photo quality only having seen pics on the camera's LCD

I have not yet used an FZ30 or FZ50, but I think this thing beats the pants off an FZ5 or FZ10 as far as image quality is concerned. Really nice camera. Has a nice dSLR type feel. 71% of people that check out the FZ20 here actually end up buying the FZ7, (as of today) but I do not believe the IQ of the FZ7 could hold a candle to that of the FZ20. Buyers may be on the *more megapixel* bandwagon. You can do a lot with 5 megapixels. 

I have found that the IQ of the FZ20 is very close to that of a dSLR

I love this camera.  I have now traveled all over the USA, some places in Europe, and will be using it in China.  Lens is excellent.  I wish it were lighter weight, but can't have everything.  And this weight has certainly no been a problem given its zoom.  I have had this camera for over two years now and have no desire to switch to anything else

I have used the camera for three months, and absolutely love it! The pictures are crisp (even very close-ups), and the video feature is right up there. Sound pick-up is excellent. I have created two DVD's combining videos and still pictures. Folks have thought the quality was very good.

The battery life was rated very good, and I have found this to be true. I carry the camera with me nearly everywhere I go. People are impressed with the size.

Drawbacks? Because of its size, there are no connections from the camera to a computer, TV or battery charger. The docking station is small and lightweight. Because of the battery life, I have never been away from home long enough to need recharging.

I recommend the camera without reservations, and will look first to Casio in the future

I have many traditional film SLRs including the original Pentax K1000 (fully manual), Canon Rebel XOS and a Canon Elph. When considering digital SLR cameras the Canon Digital Rebel and  the point-and-shoot Canon Digital Elph were at the top of my list. But at $150 less than the Canon Digital Elph, the Casio Exilim  EX-S series is a better buy with the the same features (and in some cases a better execution of the same features). If you're looking for a fun point-and-click camera that will record audio, AVI movie files and digital pictures this is it. It takes about 15 miuntes to read the manual and you're off taking pictures. Pay attention when reading the manual and everything else will seem very intuitive.
Of all the cameras I have I use this one most often. 

Other users have complained about the proprietary lithium ion battery but 3rd party equivalents are available right here on the amazon site, you just have to look. My back-up battery was only [...] bucks. San Disk 1GB memory cards are cheap too, [...] online, [...] retail. Last, I agree with many users that a lock switch needs to be developed so that you can keep the camera from accidentally turning on when it's in your pocket -- but remember many cameras have this problem/lack/this feature. I solved my own issues by buying a [...] case with a belt loop

This is a great, easy to use camera. I have had this camera for a year and it has seen alot of use. The only drawback I have had with this camera is that it eats AA batteries. I bought rechargeable AA's and they seem to last forever! Problem solved. I am about to purchase a second one for my son for Christmas. Great camera

Reasons to buy it:

1. Cheap, a mere $140.
2. Packed with features. From complete auto mode (point and shoot) to fully manual mode. 4MP and 3X optical zoom good enough for most situations.
3. Picture quality is good. It's better than the other two cameras I own (Olympus C720 UZ and Sony DSC S600).
4. Compact. It's smaller than it looks in the stock photo.
5. Fast. Switches on and is ready for the first shot within about 1.5 seconds.


Other things I liked about the camera:

 - Good ergonomics. Fits nicely in my hand, all the buttons are well placed and easy to access. I can even switch on the camera and take pictures with one hand.
 - Powerful flash. Enough to fill up a moderate size room.
 - Great video mode with sound. It also comes with an audio video cable so that you can connect the camera to your TV and watch the vidoes and pictures on your TV.
 - LCD is decent size and is fairly bright, which means it's even visible outdoors in the daytime.


Things I didn't like about the camera:

 - Manual could be more detailed. There is a bsaic manual and sort of a quick start guide. But there was no 40 page booklet which explained each and every feature in detail.
 - The auto focus illuminator (for help in focussing in low light) is a little bright and can be annoying sometimes. But the upside is that you get good focus even in really low light conditions.
 - Does not come with a battery charger. I bought rechargeable batteries and a charger separately.


I have owned the Olympus C720 UZ and the newer Sony DSC S600, but I think this camera is better than both of them.

I bought this camera in August. It is really well made and the controls are easy to navigate. I think it takes really good pictures, inside and outside. Who cares about video quality? Its a Camera, not a camcorder,lady. I think it is a really nice camera. Its really durable too. And it looks nice. I would buy it again. I researched a bunch of cameras before this one and I chose the Sony in the end. Its one step up from just taking everyday pictures. They look really pro. I'd buy it again

I really enjoy this small, high quality camara. I purchased a 2.0 GB memory disk so I could take advantage of the 7.1 mega pixel.And I get great pix everytime.  I have lots of fun with it. Since its so small, it's easy to take everywhere with me. I also get lots of compliments on it's "Fashionable" sleek design.  I highly recomend his camera.

This is enough of an instrument to show you new things in the sky for years to come. It is sturdy and simple to operate. It has enough light-gathering power (more important than magnification) to reveal dim star clusters, nebulae, and galaxies and good enough optics to show you the surface of planets like Jupiter, Saturn, and Mars.

Some advice on selection. Dobsonians like this one come in a range of sizes. A 114mm (4 ") is a bit on the small side but still a fine instrument, especially if your ability to carry large objects is limited. A 150-200mm (6-8") scope is right in the middle of the recommended range. A 250mm (10") like this one is on the big side, and you should buy one only if you are able-bodied.

Some advice on use. Viewing through a telescope is less like playing a CD and more like playing a guitar. Finding objects takes a little bit of practice. The 9x50mm "crosshair" finder supplied with this scope is great for fine searching, but I recommend supplementing it with a red-dot finder to aid in initial pointing. You will also need to buy an atlas (Sky & Telescope's Pocket sky Atlas is the best available), a red flashlight to view the charts without blowing out your badly-needed night vision, and a guidebook to lead you to interesting objects. These investments will greatly add to your enjoyment.

What more can I say? This is the kind of scope that experienced observers have been trying to steer novices towards for decades. Although, I recommend that you do your homework before buying any scope--learn the sky and get to know experienced stargazers who can advise you--when it comes time to purchase, you could hardly do better than this scope.

For more advice, see my encyclopedic guide here on Amazon, "So you want to buy a telescope.

I've had a ton of these, and I take them on camping trips with kids where the main activity is playing in big mud fields.  I've had them in my pocket while rolling around in the mud, taken it out, shot a few pics, put it back in the pocket with no problem.  (See pictures for examples of "mud photos")

A couple of times I've had them stand up to so much moisture and abuse that the cardboard falls off, but still had beautiful pictures every time, no jams or over-exposures.  

I've found the two pack at WalMart on sale for $8.99 a couple of times, and you absolutely cannot be that deal. 

This is my favorite disposable camera, and I've tried them all.

High ISO and large screen were the reasons for my purchase. The screen is great but, when you force the ISO 1600, it seems to darken the pictures more than in 800. I have a S5200 and that one seems to adjust other options like white balance much better when an ISO is set w/o having to go to full Manual option. Definitely something to improve! The auto option seems to work much better and I was surprised with how good the high speed three frame shooting works. Also, the two picture function(it takes two with slightly different sets automatically) saves me on a lot of 're-posing

First of all I would like to say that I was very reluctant to buy a SONY camera. After doing a lot of research for my needs I ended up with Canon 800IS and Sony's new toy T100. Ofcourse canon has the best overall ratings for ever but I wanted a stylish looking camera for my needs. Sony T100 is the best looking camera I have seen. It's features are awesome compared to it's small size. You can take it everywhere. Big bright screen on the back clearly visible in bright sunlight. It takes good indoor pictures too. I tried to play with its settings for while and thought that camera was not good. But then the best feature of the camera made it a winner for me. The auto mode takes great pictures and no need to set anything. Sometimes changing auto ISO helped to reduce the graniness but to be very honest if you are not going to blow the image to larger sizes (which would be 99% of the time atleast for me) it won't make difference. Just Point and Shoot. You get a perfect image for viewing on computers. No complaints apart from optional docking station which costs about $80. 5x optical zoom is boon to me as 3x was merely zoom. Also zomming while taking movies makes this a small camcoder with 640x480 30fps shooting.

It doesn't have touch screen like T50 and so it's responsiveness is better. I would like it bit faster though. Also camera takes pictures at very fast rate and the first picture you take is less than 2 secs.

I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who can afford it.

This is a camcorder for the digital age. Tiny, multi-functional, and flexible. No ancient-technology magnetic tape. As with any product on the leading edge, there are many shortcomings.

Let's dispense with the obvious. This device is all about compact go-anywhere flexibility and ease. For best image quality, a dedicated mini-DV camcorder and dedicated digital still camera is the only way to go. In fact, buying a separate camcorder and still camera may likely be less expensive than the Sanyo C6 while resulting in superior quality.

Overall image quality is best described as "OK". The poor lens zoom and aperture is more befitting a $100 digital camera than a $400 device. The flash is weak and will not light many scenes that any other still camera would light. In addition, since the flash is not offset in any way from the lens, red-eye is virtually guaranteed at any range. This is not a problem with digital touch-up being common practice, but plan on touching up more often. Low light conditions drag down image quality dramatically in video mode. Virtually any digital camcorder at any price will outperform this Sanyo in video mode in any situation, but a little day light goes a long way towards improving video quality with the Xacti C6. Also, to be clear, the video quality is still superior to anything seen in the best of analog camcorders.

For all these negatives, the convenience can be truly revolutionary. One can wear the tiny VPC-C6 around the neck all day. This causes an amazing change in attitude towards video. Since the Sanyo is so compact, no one would think twice about bringing it along on any minor travel. Being freed from the chore of "packing up" a camcorder  means a corresponding willingness to bring the Sanyo on so many more occasions, such as a visit to the park instead of just weddings and birthday parties. And whereas a mini-DV camcorder requires one hour to transfer one hour's worth of video to your computer, the Sanyo transfers video as fast as the SD card and USB 2.0 interface will allow. That means five minutes or less to transfer one hour's worth of video to a computer. This ease increases willingess to create video and share video. No more procrastination over dragging out the camcorder wiring and the manual task of initiating video transfer to a computer. With the Sanyo, just place the camera in the docking station and pictures and video files are available just like files on a USB flash drive. It is difficult to overestate the significance of this convenience. Video becomes an everyday pleasure, if one so wishes, rather than a special occasion chore. If one values this convenience over absolute image quality, this is the product to own.

This is a leading edge product. To get the most of this product, I highly recommend doing the following:
1) Sanyo has provided an updated firmware on their website. This fixes a fatal flaw in the audio processing that some people have noted as excessive distortion - this update makes audio quality competitive with other camcorders. In addition, this firmware update adds compatability with 4gb SD cards (the limit is 2gb without the update). Kudos to Sanyo for the continuing support. (Note that the instructions are a littled distorted in the translation - what they meant to write is that you need to push the SET button to the LEFT to enter the firmware update screen.)
2) The video is in MP4 format and is playable only with Quicktime. For Windows users, this limits video editing to the included programs or Quicktime-specific programs. There is an easy solution. First, download the Divx codec (a freeware commercial product) or Xvid codec (a free open source product - my preference) or ffdshow (a free open source product) - use your search engine of choice to find these. Second, download a utility called "MP4CAM2AVI" (a free open source software found easily with your search engine of choice). With these two programs, the video becomes compatable with any Windows program, including just about any media player (such as Windows Media Player) and any video editing tool (such as Windows Movie Maker).

I look forward to seeing how this market segment evolves. The freedom from bulk and digital tedium is addicting and I am sure the image quality will continue to improve. For now, I am happy capturing the memories that would have otherwise been lost had I continued to own a conventional bulky tape-based camcorder

It's pretty hard to argue against this at the prices we're seeing...

In short, for not so much more than the high end of the bridge cameras (Panasonic DMC-FZ50, Fuji S9100) you can have this camera with the 2 kit lenses. I imagine that you'll be very satisfied for paying the difference.

8MP with 2 pretty good kit lenses for under $650 as of 4/2007, and an upgrade path to the E-510 for all the lenses and accessories. Once you make that upgrade, what's left to ask for except a faster burst mode and weather sealing. That's 10MP, IS in-body, SSWF and live-view.

IMHO, even if you're an "entry-level" DSLR user, spend the extra $400+ and get the faster 14-54mm f2.8-3.5 lens and get rid of the the 14-45mm f3.5-5.6 lens. The 40-150mm f3.5-4.5 is a very nice lens, with no real peers in the entry-level DSLR range as a kit lens that I could see without going 3rd party. This lens put Olympus over the edge for me. For that speed of lens over that 35mm equivalent range (28-300mm), I'm not sure what else can compete on price. 
If you have to have a faster lens for the longer zoom, you could cough up the $800+ for the 50-200mm f2.8-3.5, and even then, that's a very, very good price for that kind of lens and 35mm equivalent range.

The camera has full manual controls, as expected from a DSLR, and can drive a newbie like me nuts, but can also keep it simple with it's auto mode and numerous scene settings (which I use a good deal).

If you get this camera, IMHO, don't bother with the xD cards. They are very slow in comparison to the less expensive CF cards in this camera.

When it comes time to get a flash, go the extra mile and get the Olympus FL-36 over the FL-20. I'm not sure that the FL-50's warranted at this price point. I was lucky to find one cheap, so I didn't have to research 3rd party flashes.

I confess to having been a pixel-peeper and compared the high-ISO samples from this camera to the Canons and Nikons of the world. It's definitely not bad in direct comparison, but after you're done resizing and touching up the photos, you'll never notice, IMHO. On the down side, the RAW files (.ORF) don't seem to be compressed, and they're not exactly small at 14MB.

All in all, not much to complain about here

I don't like pink so I bought the blue bag.  I had bought a black one, but it was so skimpy I returned it and prayed until this one arrived. I had no trouble with Amazon crediting me for the return, either.  It was so cute!  I'm too old for "cute," but I kept it because I needed a case for my new HP R717.  It is small, yet padded enough to trust that your camera will be cushioned if you drop it.  I have dropped my camera and it was not injured.  It has a little pouch inside to store an extra battery for my camera, not the big AA batteries, but the flat type that come with my R717.  I recommend this little bag, or the pink one, even if you don't like pink...or blue.  They are well cushioned and snug, but not too snug you think they will tear.  The are sturdy and have nice shoulder straps and magnet closures

I bought this camera to take pictures of my sons playing basketball.  My other camera shot dark grainy pictures indoor.  I have had a lot of success with this and really nice outdoor shots as well.  What I just started playing with, and I love is the video feature.  It is so easy to use and the images are better than I expected.  I bought this camera in December as a present to myself and I have used it constantly and recharged the battery twice.  This is major to me as my Nikon was devouring batteries in an afternoon.  The optical zoom is clean, but the digital is definitely noisy. I have had fun shooting pictures of my kids because the shutter speed is so quick and I don't miss the shot.

This camera is very similar to the Fuji F30, but has face detection (fd) that autofocuses on faces in a photo.  Great for taking pictures of yourself, or for snapshots you don't have time to compose.  Excellent quality photos in dim light. At 3200 ISO, photos are washed out and noisy, but still good for capturing an image you would otherwise miss. Option to limit ISO to 1600, or to 400. Camera will use any speed up to the limit. 400 ISO is extremely good. As good as my Canon Digital Rebel xti. Usual modes I never use (flower, landscape, etc.), but one unique mode I use all the time: no flash/flash. The camera takes a picture without flash up to 3200 ISO, and then takes a picture with flash immediately after. Usually takes less than one second to capture both images. No flash doesn't surprise anyone and ruin the candid shot, while the following flash guarantees you'll get the image, even if the "warm glow of candlelight" is ruined. I always have the camera set to this mode. Uses xD cards, which I hate, but if you buy a 1 GB card you'll be able to take 400 - 500 photos without ever needing to change the card. Also, battery life is unbelieveable! Fully charge the camera over several hours, and you'll be able to take 400 photos, half with flash, before the battery is drained. Fuji-brand underwater housing is optional, watertight to 40m (121 ft.) Camera comes with underwater setting to intensify non-blue colours, and still keep the intense blue of the water. Literally *every* diver should have one of these cameras. I recommend this camera without hesitation. There simply isn't anything else like it on the market.

Combine the high ISO, low noise and fast shutter speed for great blur free shots on low light AND MOVING SUBJECTS. This is what only Fuji can offer to you on compact camera class.

The F31fd doesn't have IS (Image stabilized lenses or a CCD shift sensor), which other cameras use to reduce the effect of blur from camera shaking. But this kind of stabilization is really only useful for 6x or more zoom, for just 3x typical zoom on ultra compact P&S you just need to hold it firmly and will get the same results.

IS also can't prevent blur from moving subjects. With a High ISO like on F31fd you can use faster shutter speeds that will freeze subjects and prevent blur from camera shaking too. 

Fuji Super CCD sensor provides the lowest noise on High ISO you will find on 2007's compact cameras, the quality is only comparable to the big DSLR professional cameras.

Ah, and the Face Detection is not just a gimmick or marketing appeal... it's really great, specially if someone who doesn't know how to focus on the face then recompose the scene is taking pictures of you, with F31fd they will not miss the shot

I got a pair of these for Christmas. Initially, I was skeptical about the quality of an inexpensive roof-prism optic, and this isn't my favorite brand name either. But contrary to my expectations, I've been extremely impressed with them so far.

Good brightness, contrast, sharpness, field of view, and close focus all exceeded my expectations for a binocular at this price point. Feel, fit and finish are all very good.

I wear eyeglasses, and these binoculars still deliver a nice wide view through the eyepiece. The twist-down eyecups are quick to extend / retract if you are sharing these with someone who doesn't wear glasses.

They come with a decent carry case, and relative to porro-prism types, the weight and compactness are both a little bit better.

If you are looking for a good binocular for birding or general use, I highly recommend you take a look through these in addition to the other popular models. I think these really hit the sweet spot for price / size / weight / performance, and I'm very happy with them

My bother-in-law and I went to Africa on safari last year. We had purchased the binoculars especially to use while hunting. The optics were good and we were initially impressed by the image stabilization while still here in the states. Our impressions were confirmed when our professional hunters fell in love with them during the hunt. They were so impressed by the IS and price that we left a pair with our hunter. He used them for the entire season last year, and when he visited "The States" last month, he reported that they are still doing well

The ergonomics: Perfect. The D200 is not completely rubber-encased. There's rubber where your hands need to hold it, and plastic where your hands rarely touch it. The hand grip is comfortable and nicely concave where the tips of your fingers can dig in.

The battery door and the memory card door are made of plastic, and hinge-pinned. A simple slide latch opens the battery door....and some have warned the latch could be easily (accidentally) tripped. The memory card door latch, however, uses a more secure 45 degree pivoting latch.

USB 2 and Video Out/DC-in doors are made of flexible rubber, and these doors extend into the body of the camera as the hinges themselves.

The English language operating manual is a work of art. Each operating concept is alpha' & numerically numbered at the pictoral diagram, and to the page where the function is explained in perfect English. The reader will quickly catch on to how this well thought out manual is organized. 

I like the depth of field preview, the mirror lock-up, and the multiple-exposure capability. 

The continuous servo autofocus does a better job than any human at following and focusing on any moving object. 

If you have the old manual-focus, film-based Nikon SLR lenses from the '70's and '80's, except for a few rare exceptions, will fit on the D200.

All these positive attributes remind me of the best, most highly-evolved film camera SLR's. No wonder so many photographers have been won over to digital media.

1.  The camera will not slide out even though the clasp is magnet. It is made snug enough that the felt holds it in the case even with a shake or jostle.

2.  Durable. No scrapes or scratches in 7 months.

3.  Haven't missed the belt clip option, its small enough to fit in my pocket

4.  Well constructed/durable.  People think its some sort of iPod case/holder

The picture is fine at this price.

I bought the Panasonic VDR-D100 for my daughter because she usually doesn't want to do anything with the computer like edit video. When we gave it to her the first thing she asked was, "can I edit the movies?" 

I did a quick test to make sure the DVDs would finalize and work on another DVD player with success on 3 computers and 3 DVD players. I didn't find anything the disc wouldn't play on.

Then I started up Vegas Movie Studio Platinum which I use to edit my miniDV movies. I selected IMPORT from DVD and it went straight to the miniDVD and loaded in the files where I was able to edit and add titles, music, sound effects and a voice over if I wanted to. 

Since I already bought DVD-R/W discs she will be able to reuse them if she ever edits the movies because you can unfinalize the discs and reformat them.

I did a lot of research before buying this camera.  We could have bought a higher quality digital camcorder for less or higher quality MiniDV camcorder for the same price.  What led to our final decision to purchase this camcorder was the fact we could record straight to a 8cm DVD-R, finalize the disc on the camcorder, and play it directly on our DVD player or DVD-ROM player on our computer.  We didn't want to deal with sticking cables and wires into the TV, electrical outlet, and camera to playback footage.  And we also didn't want to deal with the cost and trouble of transferring footage onto DVDs to keep in our video library for the future.

For those of you who like to edit, re-record, create effects, etc., you need to purchase special software separately, but with a DVD-RAM disc, you have the ease and convenience of doing it all from your DVD-ROM on your computer.  You can also download it with the USB cable, but it is nice to be able to just pop it in the DVD drive and get started.  

If you are only interested in playback, DVD-R discs are sufficient; however, you can't erase or record over footage on DVD-Rs, only DVD-RW and DVD-RAM discs.  

The picture quality of the camera is adequate.  It isn't grainy, but smooth and actually very nice in the right lighting, especially outside on a sunny day.  It doesn't have a built-in light, so you have to be aware of the right surroundings and environment for recording.  I would give the picture quality a 3.75 out of 5.  If you want better quality, you will need to buy a more expensive DVD Camcorder.  Considering how far we have come over the years with home video technology, it definitely beats those days images were out of focus and grainy.  You can't compare it to TV and movie camera quality, but I think it is pretty darn good for home videos.  The zoom is good, but of course it takes some time to focus if you zoom in or out too quickly.  The stabilizer is pretty good, but I keep it off for the most part to get better picture quality.  If you plan to move around a lot, use the function, but expect to lose a little quality in the process.  What basically happens when using the stabilizer (with most cameras, I believe) is that the image movements are slightly delayed.  The sound quality is adequate, but if you are recording when it is windy, you will pick up a lot of the wind sounds unless you block the microphone with your hand.

The only problem I have had so far is with the discs.  We bought Panasonic DVD-RW discs and can't get them to play on our computer or in our DVD player.  We ended up purchasing Sony DVD-R discs and they play with no problem.  When I called Panasonic about their DVD-RW discs, they didn't have a good answer.  The representative told me to make sure the DVD-RW discs are compatible with my players.  I told her they may not be compatible with my DVD Player, but it should be with my new computer software.  The representative just repeated herself and eventually said there isn't any difference between Sony and Panasonic discs (interesting).  They make the claim that Panasonic discs work the best in the manual, but now I know better.

Overall, this camcorder is a great value (you can't beat the price for this DVD technology), average to good quality picture and functions, is excellent for the ease and convenience of DVD playback and storage, and is really easy to use.

I agree with many of the reviewers--in the mid range and wide angle the lens is superb, but it is not quite as sharp as a tele--as one of the reviewers said--it does many things, and not all of them perfectly--the lens is a compromise, but an excellent compromise--the VR is an added boost--
I'm still debating whether or not to keep it or send it back, because of the weakness in the tele-- but there is nothing else that can replace its versatility.--I don't want to keep changing lenses

Pros: Compact and complete, this portable lighting studio offers flexibility with it's reversible backdrop (gray/blue). I also have used the black back panel for some shots as well. Construction quality is good ( I found one of my cats sleeping on the top panel, which is fabric and held in place with Velcro tabs), sturdy enough for its intended purpose. I like the output of the lights--seems to be a broad spectrum similar to daylight.

Cons: Only one complaint: The output of the lights could be stronger. Requires a tripod to gain depth of field with a smaller aperture

The Bushnell Perma Focus 7x50 Wide Angle Binoculars were the ideal choice for my recent trip to Tanzania and the Serengeti. They worked perfectly for the application needed. A really happy surprise on just how well these worked. As we bounced around on dirt roads and cross country in Land Rovers, the Perma Focus feature was outstanding and made things simple and easy! :-) The magnification level was perfect for almost every scenario we came across. Anything that was outside of about 80 feet came through in crystal clear vivid color and clarity. It really made for up close and personal viewing of all the animals we saw. By far, these were the best investment I made before the trip! I can't imagine being without them now on such an expedition. Really fantastic performance and a great value to boot!!!! The vendor was fast & flawless in the transaction too. In my opinion you won't be disappointed with these binoculars. Troy :-)

One of the reviews I read before purchasing these suggested that the reviewer should've had them for her Celine Dion concert.  I took the suggestion and they were perfect!  They fit nicely in my evening bag and brought Celine closer to me as I sat in the Second Mezzanine at Caesar's Palace!  Not only that - but the price was right! I couldn't be happier!  Plus, now I have them for our next trip to Rocky Mountain Park to get up close and personal to some wildlife

Nikon has always been the leader in photography/ camera/ lenses.  Others have nobly tried but a Nikon remains the high bar that others only hope to reach.

When the shift from film to digital began, there was some speculation if Nikon could keep up with the competition.  Well, rest assure that not only have they kept up, they continue to lead the way.  The latest example of this is the D200.

Like the D70/ D80 - this is a solid piece of equipment.  Just the feel of it tells you that you are holding an excellent piece of technology.  But the proof will always be in the end results and again, the combination of the Nikon know-how and Nikon lenses lead even a beginner to come up with excellent pictures.

Gone is the "lag between shots".  You can fire up and shoot multiple pictures in seconds so action shots are all yours.  Without even "tweaking" a picture with a computer program, you can print top of the line photos at home.  

People have cited the cons:  Expensive.  Yes.  The camera does come with a hefty price tag but it should be kept in mind that this is a piece of machinery intended for serious photographers.  If you are a "vacation and holiday" picture taker, then you should elect to buy a cheaper camera.  The same is true with the difficulty of the multitude of small buttons, dials and switches.  There are too many and they can be overwhelming but only to someone who is in the "point and shoot" school of picture taking.  Anyone else will relish the options that Nikon has provided us with on the D200.

Room for improvement?  Well, the battery life is nowhere near as good as the D70 which I upgraded from but that is a weak complaint as you can still get hundreds of shots on one charge.  Also, it would be a boon if the flash would automatically pop up when needed like in former models.

So if you are serious about photography and always have one at the ready, this is the one for you

Overall its a fine viewer however it has a couple of problems.

#1) it would be really nice if there was a way to copy pictures off of a SD card and into memory and vice versa. This would be invaluable for moving pictures around without having to hook things up to a computer.

#2) hooking it up to a computer is a pain, instructions are not helpful. If you are using the viewer to look at images off of SD cards in remote places (ie trailcamera) it works fine, but I'd like the ability to move pictures off of a card into the viewers internal memory so I can leave the card with the trailcamera.

#3 this is nasty, if you cycle through the pictures too fast you can "crash" the viewer. Upon resetting it, it will say there are no pictures found on the memory card. Powering off, swapping cards wont help it read. The pictures are still there however but you need to then access the card directly through a computer to extract. Reformat the card and it will be fine with the reader.

For what I use it for I like it even though it has quirks that must be worked around.

I purchased this camera 2 weeks ago.
I love using it.
It has lots of function to play with. It is easy to use.
I didnt have trouble taking good pictures in zoom mode outdoor.
Indoor, I had to use tripod if i use zoom.
However, i cant really think of any occasion that i have to use zoom indoor other than my testing last week.
Besides, it gives great pictures and I loved the price. I kind of considered DSLR camera but I gave it up becasue lenses were more expensive than camera itself. I considered one wide angle lense and one zoom lense. It would have cost me almost 2000 dollars
So far, I love this camera.
If this helps to anyone considering buying this camera, Id give two thumbs up.

Images from this camera are very high quality.  The 18X optical zoom is very usable with only minimal distortion noticeable at the extremes.  The optical image stabilization system (based on stabilizing the CCD image sensor instead of lens elements) is quite good and performed well under several different circumstances (moving car, boat, shaky hands).  

My main gripe with this camera is the lack of high speed USB 2.0 support.  The fine print says that the USB interface is "full speed" which means a maximum transfer rate of 12 Mbit/s instead of the 480 Mbit/s possible with high speed USB.  So, downloading photos from the camera through the USB interface is painfully slow compared to most current generation digital cameras such as a Canon SD900.  

The software provided with the camera is somewhat difficult to use and is slow and unresponsive.

It would also be desirable if the camera could accept a lithium ion rechargeable battery in addition or instead of the 4 AA batteries it uses.  But, battery life with both alkaline and rechargeable NiMH AA batteries was adequate.

To All,

I just purchased the SP-550UZ after searching for the best camera bang for the buck - Olympus fills the bill..... 3/3/07 was my first day of use and I decided to check ALL the features - with the batteries supplied - still in use and a 2GB card - I took off for the outdoors and began shooting pictures at a local park - 300 pictures - including several 15 FPS and 30 FPS shoots and  three videos - 15, 30 and 45 seconds in length.

I am not a pro and will be using this camera for Sports, vacations and every day family events.

No Cons yets - I love the "SCN" feature - just select how you want to take the picture and the camera setups the camera - all you have to do is take the picture

I got this camera for my birthday present in January and I'm extremely satisfied.  I'm very new to the entire "photography world", however this camera makes it easy to get into.  The camera is smaller than I expected, however it takes great pictures.  I use it often for pictures while we are on trips.  The picture quality is great, however screen quality isn't up-to-par with other brands.  This is a great value and I really like it.  My only complaint is that the Easyshare software is bad.  It's slow, outdated, and doesn't work well overall.  I recommend getting a 1 GB SD card.  I have 3 of them

I've been using 35mm SLR cameras for over 30 years. For the last 9 or 10 years I have gone through several under $400 digital cameras as the technology has improved. This Kodak Z710 is a very economical compromise.  The built-in 10X optical zoom is a great feature.  
The Z710 does not have image stabilization (IS)as do some of the more expensive models but if you have a moderately steady hand and you press the shutter button rather than pound it (and the whole camera!) that's not really a problem.  
Another feature of this camera that I really appreciate is the manual settings position which allows much more creative control of a shot. Check out the Kodak web site for more information on this.  
I bought this camera from an Amazon dealer for less than $200 shipped to me.  That's cheaper than a reconditioned unit (same model!) recently sold on eBay

I made the decision to buy this camera based on the many very positive user reviews.  It replaces a six year old 2.1 megapixel camera.  I am not disappointed.  Amazon's price is very good for a 7.1 megapixel camera with a boatload of features.  It is also considerably lighter in weight than the older camera.    

Later I read reviews by experts who give it only mediocre scores for picture quality.  They criticize it for no image stabilization leading to blur (especially at higher power zoom) and "noise" at film speeds over 100 ASA.  I set up a couple of situations in which both problems should have been very apparent.  Then I enlarged smaller portions of the frames to print inexpensive 4 x 6 test photos.  Had I printed the full frame, the print would have been larger than an 8 x 10.  I just do not see the problems the experts criticize.  The colors are rich and vibrant.

I really appreciate the wide range of controls.  The user can choose a from a number of modes fitted to various situations.  These result in a faster shutter speed, or more depth of field, or fill-in flash, etc.  It is not necessary to memorize the tiny icons on the selector dial.  An on-screen prompt tells you what each mode does.  I also like the amount of control in the manual mode.  The user can choose the ASA rating, shutter speed, apeture opening, and electronic flash mode.  The manual tells how to set the camera for special situations, like photographing documents.  When you take the picture, the through the lens screen goes black for part of a second.  You know the picture has been taken, unlike a camera with an optical finder.  

The camera is very intuitive for first time use.  I also read most of the manual on-line while waiting for delivery and handled the camera several times in a local discount store.

When I first installed the software I restarted the computer, but it repeatedly would not recognize the camera.  I switched to another USB cord and it worked fine immediately.  Then it also began to work with the original USB cord.  I had even checked for a loose connection.  Who knows what that was about!

One little thing to keep in mind is this.  If the camera is set on continuous auto focus, you can aim and shoot.  If it is set on one-time auto focus, you must press the shutter halfway down and wait for the green light before shooting, if you want sharp pictures.  I do not know, but expect the difference is battery life.

A 1 GB memory card can store 485 pictures at the 7.1 megapixel resolution

This 10-20mm lens is equivalent to a 15-30mm in a 35mm film camera, so it's an ultra-wide lens at 10mm. I was pleasantly surprised at how sharp the images are from this lens; and it's rectilinear, which means that straight lines in real life remain straight in the photograph. It is a well-made lens, made with high-grade materials. What this lens excels at is when you want to photograph sweeping landscapes, close-quarters interior photography, and in architectural photography where you don't mind the exaggerated converging lines that an ultrawide produces. Personally, that's what I like, so I'm very happy with this Sigma 10-20mm

Not only is this beauty wide, I have found the lens is very sharp to on my D200! It is built solid and focus's fast, and I don't have any problem with distortion because I use DXO Optics software and it cleans it up automaticly! Buy this lens, it is cheap for what you get

I've been using the Sigma 10-20mm about twice or three times a month and I am very pleased. At such a wide angle, you will most like need to "de-fish" your final shot which can be remedied with CS2 or some other image processing software. At 10-20mm, the range is almost too wide, but after further usage, I got used to it. I'm very accustomed to a 12-24mm range and the 10-20mm took a lot of getting used to. The only drawbacks I know of in using this lens is that it is really prone to flare (despite the marketing by Sigma stating that the new lens coating diminishes flare) and the biggest aperture is f/4 which is variable pending on the focal length. It is not a fixed aperture lens. I also find that this lens is at it's sharpest around f/8-f/11 and I wouldn't go beyond that because I started noticing the degrading of image quality at very small apertures with this lens. But other than that, I've been pretty satisfied for the price I paid for this ultra wide angle lens. I still would prefer Nikon's 12-24mm, but I'm not willing to shell out that much money on a wide angle lens. Sigma's price for their 10-20mm is acceptable

Shooting with a dslr is great in a lot of ways, but the sensor crop kills my wide-angle capability, which, to me, is absolutely awful!

Personally, I hate zoom lenses. I've got a full set of Nikon primes. And while I'd prefer a prime lens, these zoom lenses are the only game in town for wide angle on crop sensor dslr.

I like this lens because it goes WIDE on digital. I suggest you buy this lens for the 10mm and keep it at 10mm because the 10mm wide end is really where it's at and the reason to buy this lens over the alternatives.

For anybody considering 10mm vs 12mm at the wide end, unless you mostly use the narrower end of the focal length most of the time, 2mm is a SIGNIFICANT difference in field of view on short lenses. As the focal length increases (eg, from 400mm to 600mm), the difference in angle of view is not very large. But the difference between 10mm is 12mm even though "only 2mm" is no laughing matter, and if you don't believe me, you can do a comparison in a camera shop to prove it to yourself.

If you end up deciding to get a 12mm, you want to buy the sigma 12mm (I think it is 12-24mm?) because that lens covers full 35mm frame (and the angle of view has got to be absolutely amazing)!

Also, if Sigma or Nikon reads this review, please make an 8mm or 9mm f2.8 rectilinear crop sensor prime!

And if Sigma reads this review, I want some f1.2 or f1.0 AFD primes! 50mm for film maybe even a digital sensor version in some medium range focal length! I would definitely buy (full frame coverage of course) a mid length and a medium wide angle and a short tele! Neither Nikon nor Canon makes anything like that (well, canon kind of does/did), so you'd have the market segment dominated

I have been shooting away for the last few weeks.  The Olympus 720 is a gem.  I must have filled up my card 3-4 times so far.  Being new to the digital camera era, I am finding that it is not as hard as I thought it would be.  Shoot, pop the card into the card reader, copy to computer, upload to Walmart's photo service, and I have my prints mailed to my house in a few days.  I am happy that everything was included with the kit.  I would have never known what I needed and it basically has everything covered

This is a cool implimentation of a much needed device for those with D200s. The camera loves batteries. Having two is good!  Having the ability to watch one drain and knowing there's another on standbye is a fine feeling. Knowing that there are two more batteries in the case waiting is even better! For a full day of shooting, you need this and some serious memory. Highly recommended. Also handles AAs... always good in field conditions

I have been using this scope on the beach at night to monitor sea turtle nesting. When up close, the image is excellent, but not so good for far away (more than 100-200 ft). Very easy to use, and the fact that it's waterproof is a plus (haven't dropped it in the ocean yet!). You can't really get a feel for how good the image is in a residential area, but out on the beach, with the moonlight, it rocks. Most of the time I don't even need the IR illuminator. To save power, turn it off, and it will still provide an image with the available light for almost 5 minutes. If you're looking to see things that are far away, this scope won't work well, but for things that are close by (say, from one end of the backyard to the other) it's a good deal. I put mine in a hard sided padded carrying case, since it gets bounced around on the ATV, and haven't had a problem yet

I just bought this for about $190 at the local PX.  I am impressed so far.  I was going to buy the GS180, but for the sale price I would be crazy to pass this up.
SO far the low light is much better than a single CCD.  The video playback is quiet compared to a few other camcorders that record the motor noise onto the tape.  
I plan on buying an extended battery and a tripod today at the same sale.  
I will use this camcorder mostly for home videos of my son and vacations we take around Europe.  I look froward to using this camcorder a lot

I bought this rangefinder for golf. It is small enough that I could keep it in my pocket. It really helps me with the approach shots to the greens. It takes a bit of experience to be able to focus on the flag. I usually use a person on the green as my target. After I got an approximate read, I use the scan mode to find the exact distance to the flag. Be careful with the tiny battery cover. It came loose and I lost it on the golf course. Fortunately, I recovered it amongst the green grass. The cover is also green. I now put a tape over it to secure the cover.

This rangefinder is great! Much lighter than the big bulky other units. Has all the great features that is needed. This is one that you will take with you and not leave in the truck because it's too big.  I tested this against some of my buddies' bigger units at known distances and this one out did the bigger units in speed and accuracy. Great scan mode. Best buy.  Should be sold for about ($) more than asked for

Looks exactly as the posted picture except the badge reads "Panasonic", not "Lumix". Fits the camera perfectly. No extra room for memory cards, spare battery, charger, etc. It's easier to insert the camera with both zippers down. The belt loop won't fit most belts. No straps. However, the camera's strap is good enough. Good protection

The changer performs perfectly.  I was surprised that the price was so high for such a simple gadget.  The only other drawback is that the cord is not as long as the original, about one foot shorter.  Other than that, it is fine.  I gave my original changer to my daughter, whose charger died just before leaving the country

I bought this camera for my girlfriend and she loves it. It has all the basic functions her older Coolpix had abut more and they're a bit more user friendly. 
Pros: Compact and easy to Hold. I've had a few other Point and Shoots and they feel like they are going to jump out of my hand. This one feels pretty good. 
Cons: Before buying I read the reviews and a few were stating that the focus was not everything it should be. I will agree. That is the cameras only real big down fall. Though my girlfriend may not notice it so much, to me it's a little more aparant.
For the most part, overall I really like this little guy..

This is a really nice compact camera from Canon. The picture quality is excellent. I have tried some night/day shots and the pictures are great. The zoom is the pretty much non existant at 3x however that depends on what you use the camera for. The build quality is excellent and I really love the 3" display. I find the ipod like controls very convenient too though it takes some practice to get used to it. The camera is very compact but I never had problems to get a good grip and a steady hand. The images have excellent true color and are indeed sharp. I would definetely recommend an accessory kit for this camera which includes a nice small leather case and an extra original Canon battery and its available on Amazon. The accessory kit turns out to be cheaper than buying the individual components and its contains original Canon parts especially the extra battery. Also get a SD card with large enough memory. What comes with the camera (32MB) is really a waste. Still don't understand why these camera manufactures throw in such a small memory card. But overall a great easy to use and a smart looking camera that produces wonderful results

Takes great pics and the 3" screen is REALLY nice. Wall plug in recharger is nice also. I have taken pics outside in sunny, overcast, & rainy conditions. Indoors at sporting events and around the house. In all settings the pics have been truly wonderful. A few instances of blurriness caused by an unsteady hand but otherwise very nice pics.

However, as Canon's top of the line Powershot commanding a higher dollar price this camera really should have a higher optical zoom. 3x isnt enough when other, cheaper cameras have 6x optical zoom. Also Image Stabilzation should be included

Works better than I could have hoped.  I have used it for about a month and it is very simple to execute -- but you have to be able to hold somewhat steady which is not a problem for me.  If you are someone who has the shakes -- may be a problem.
  I have compared the accuracy to gps devices with guys playing with me.  This is better since it gives you the actual yardage to the pin.  Also, you can get yardage to another golfer in the field, and yardage to any object, bunker, tree etc., which the gps can't.  
   A lot of courses are not marked correctly, and, of course, yardage changes depending on how far off to the side of the fairway -- or even out of the fairway -- you are.  This is where it is especially nice.  There are times when without this device you are just flat out guessing.
   This is an awesome piece of technology.  It was well worth the price for me.

This digital camera is the best.  I cannot complain about any aspect of it.  It has a huge amount of modes and settings and additional features to add to pictures as you are taking them.  It's small enough to fit into your pocket and not think about it (it's smaller than a wallet).  It takes excellent pictures that come out looking great, all very high quality.  The huge screen makes it easy to view what you are looking at and has great image quality.  The videos are equally good, with great sound and good picture.  It looks better than just about any other digital camera that I have seen.  Even though I said I cannot complain, there are a few things that slightly annoy me occasionally.  The first is that it flashes twice.  Remember to tell this to people before taking their picture!  After the first flash, people tend to look away, and by the time the second flash comes and the picture is taken, the moment is lost.  This only occurs when the camera is set to "AUTO" mode.  I usually press the menu button and choose a mode.  When you do this, the flashes occur very quickly (you barely notice a gap between them).  Some of the features are very useful.  I use the "backlight" mode quite often.  It allows you to take a picture of something even if there is a bright light in the background.  My only other complaint is for those of us with large fingers, the circular button that operates pretty much every feature can be difficult to use (sometimes I push 2 buttons at once, or the complete wrong one).  But everything else that this camera can do cancels it out.  This camera has more features and better quality than many larger and more expensive cameras out there

 While not on the 'highest end' of tripod purchases, this one is a must for anyone owning a HDR-HC1 or other compatable camcorder. Operating the camera from the tripod (rather than the touch screen) provides steady footage for the amatuer videographer. The unit assembles easily and has stable panning and rotation. The only drawback is the soft storage bag which doesn't provide adequate head protection

handy item for price.  not a great telescope, but a very useful tool to look at roof shingles, broken tree limbs, bird's nests, etc.   Must be stable, but can be carried in a pocket, weighs very little and is very clear. Very good deal.

I haven't used it much but the few photos I have taken are excellent. I'm not a photography expert so I'll leave the technicalities to others.  Telephoto capability is increased noticeably but not a huge amount.  The high quality of this lens, as with the wide-angle, is obvious.  Comes with caps and a storage bag

Was pleased to receive the Kodak Schneider-Kreuznach Xenar 1.4x 55mm Telephoto Lens and at a huge discount compared to other merchants. I do freelance photography and purchased this lens to use with the KODAK P712. The Kodak P712 is a great camera and takes excellent pictures. By adding the Kodak Schneider-Kreuznach Xenar 1.4x 55mm Telephoto Lens to the P712, it makes already great pictures even better, and what clarity. I recommend this product to everyone!

The picture and dimensions are incorrect.  It is a soft case but is ribbed horizontally and mine came in blue.  The correct dimensions are 2.9"x4.2"x1.8" (WxHxD).

It also fits the Fujifilm v10 camera which I bought it for.  Amazon has a different case built specifically for the v10 but it costs more and might be nicer based on that picture.  I am keeping this one, it is a perfect fit

I bought this as a present for my wife.  I was looking for something that she could carry in her purse.  the automatic functions are easy and functional.  It is not an enthusiasts camera:  too hard to get into the menus.  The screen is easy to turn off(this sucks battery power).  and it even has an optical viewfinder(a rare finding lately)  the optical viewfinder helps to get steady pictures for those of us with the shakes.  The pictures are clear and the colors are excellent.  The drawback is the that sony batteries cost an arm and a leg.  The wire for downloading pix is multifunctional and very proprietary(read that as expensive if you lose it

I purchased a Nikon L5 from Costco 2 weeks ago but returned it on Saturday after I saw the LZ-7.  The LZ-7 is way better in all aspects than the Nikon L5, save for the adjustable zoom in movie mode.

PROS:  Takes great pictures; optical image stabilization; 6X zoom; and, great price.  It is also made in Japan, not China as the Nikon L5 is.

Cons:  Fixed zoom while in movie mode; no on-board camera speakers

Fall through Spring I always carry my R817 in coat pocket when I go out. This jacket fits my camera like a glove. Allows access to all controls and LCD display through clear, heavy duty plastic film, once flap is opened. Open flap allows lens to zoom while still protecting rest of camera. Only time I  zip open jacket is to remove memory chip or change battery, otherwise, I just leave jacket on camera at all times.

Upgrading to the TZ3 from a 4yr old Canon 3.2 megapixel. Waited a few months to purchase when I heard the TZ1 was being updated. With the TZ3, Panasonic has fixed the main complaints about the TZ1 which were: No build in lens cover, noisy images at higher ISO speeds. IMO, the build in lens cover alone is wirth the price permium over the TZ1. 

As others have said, this camera has a great build quality, easy operation, and a high-quality look. I ordered the black model and was pleasantly surprised when I opened the box. It has the look of a retro 35mm cartridge camera, which is cool. The chrome (or polished stainless steel, cant tell), is first rate and looks great with the matte black case. The LCD is huge and bright. The camera's "Simple Mode" does a great job the the other modes are fully customizable. The zoom is fantastic, but you need a really steady hand at full zoom, even with Optical Stabilization turned on. I did take some surprisingly sharp shots zoomed way in from my car as I came across a herd of deer. Shot to shot speed is really great, unless you are using the flash. The red-eye reduction works better than any other digital camera I have used. Overall, I am extremely pleased. If you are looking for a great zoom camera in a small form factor, you should seriously consider the DMC-TZ3

I shot my second feature (Flying Tiger) on the DVX and took it to the Cannes Film Fest market and no one could tell it wasn't film.  This camera is fantastic if you shoot right.  I suggest this camera over all the other similarly-priced models.  We have done extensive testing with many cameras and this is my favorite.  The JVC is many thousands more and you get less grain with it in dark areas, true, but for the money, the DVX, if you shoot properly with it, will get you amazing results.  

For proof, you can check out footage shot in a ton of lighting conditions at my site.  

We had the best luck in natural light, with simple chimera diffusers.  If you're honest with yourself and don't plan on hitting the lottery anytime soon (getting a real distribution deal/full 35mm blowup) and you need a good looking film for fests or DVD, there is no way you should shoot on film, or another camera.  We shot a full feature on no money and had many distrib offers, all because of the look this camera gave us.  I'm planning on using it again for my next film.  !Viva la revolucion!  Put the DVX in 24p Advanced mode and rip the knob off

-Function is easy to use.
-Battery life is so so. 
-Battery charger design is not convenience. You have the put the battery into the batter charger. recommand to get a cradle charger, but extra cost. It should sell with cradle charger.

I think is a "must" for any beginner, for a low price you can have almost all the different size of EP. Try them for a few months and then when you will be completely sure what do you want and buy the EP that you need.

When I first opened up the "Super Quick Charger" I was a bit put off... it's small, it's cheap looking... compared to the old NiCd charger I used to have it was very unimpressive. Then I plugged it in. 

Say what you will about this barebones solution, it works amazingly well. It charges the batteries quickly and the batteries last a really long time in between charges. It does exactly what I was looking for. 

If I could improve anything it would be to implement some sort of cover on the battery slots. While it's not essential to the process by any means, it would look a lot better, and the batteries would be less prone to being jostled out of their positions in mid-charge by a curious cat.

I love this battery charger!  I used to use store bought AA batteries for my Olympus digital camera, but after keeping the batteries in the camera for only a week, the batteries were drained of power.  For some reason, this twin battery pack can stay charged for a few months if I am just storing my camera.  Highly recommended

I own the stylus 710 that I have had since september of last year, and love it to pieces.  Little did I know olympus was relaseing this little monster onto the market 2 months later.  It has all of the features and software of the 710 model, with digital image stabilization, but 
5x optical/5.6x digital/28x total zoom , an upgrade from 15x total zoom (3x optical and 5x digital).  The price is about the same, and actually an excellent deal here on amazon. The 2.5" color LCD monitor with histogram display and auto image rotation has been standard in the 710 and 810, and the 1000 series, and I have not problem with it, I think it is comparable to all models in this range (panasonic, fuji, kodac, hp).  I the bright sun, no LCD is going to be really great. I have captured many fun moments with this camera (2 weddings, 2 vacations) and love it. The diffence with the 740 model is the thickness is a bit bigger due to the bigger optical lense, but that is well worth the sacrifice, because having more optical zoom = better picture.  I know, I tested this side by side with my 710.  Pick this up, you will not be dissapointed. Also, look at the 750 and the 760 models, both of which have optical image and digital image stabilization, but alter the zooms a bit.  Compare, and see what meets your needs. 

Also, the Olympus Mastersoftware is very easy to use, And with panoramic feature, 3d, and Extra ART Features unlocked by Olympus Brand-Olympus Stamped Type H HD, this camera becomes even more of a pleasure to own. you can edit photos on the computer, or right in the palm of your hand. Both ways, this camera will make you feel like a pro in no time.

I took this case with me to my trip to New Zealand and it allowed me to take amazing pictures of rafting and cave tubing.  If I didn't have this case I would have missed out on amazing shots.  It's a great way to protect your camera from sand as well.  I loved it so much I actually bought one for my sister as well.  It is a great investment for anyone that doesn't want to worry about their camera getting ruined and also wants to take amazing underwater pictures and videos

Looks exactly as the posted picture except the badge reads "Panasonic", not "Lumix". Fits the camera perfectly. No extra room for memory cards, spare battery, charger, etc. It's easier to insert the camera with both zippers down. The belt loop won't fit most belts. No straps. However, the camera's strap is good enough. Good protection

I did a lot of research before buying the PV-GS250.  Now that I have the camera in my hands I know I made a great choice.  Great image quality. Great build quality. The low light problems you read about are not really a big deal.  In a noramlly lit room everything is fine.

I'm like most people with a digital camera. I take a bazillion pictures, develop 10% onto paper, and then banish the other 90% to computer storage archives. I mean, I'd love to display a lot more of those pictures from my computer, but who has the wall space or time to organize all of those prints? That's why I decided to get a digital picture frame. I had been looking for quite some time, but was always turned off by the small-ish LCD sizes or poor resolutions. Then I came across this Coby 10" widescreen unit, with the 800x480 pixel display! There were no reviews on Amazon (at the time), but spec-wise it had what I wanted; a larger display and higher resolution.

I took the chance and ordered one and am I glad I did! The display is huge, and the pictures look crisp. Colors are pretty accurate when compared to that of my calibrated LCD computer monitor. The interchangeable frames (it comes with a black one as well as the white one) make it easy to match with your dcor. The litte remote is easy to use, but easy to lose as well, so make sure you place it somewhere easy to find. The built-in MP3 player is a nice touch. The speakers aren't that great (it is a picture frame after all), but it's nice to have the frame play music while in slideshow mode. There is a variety of transition effects to choose from. I haven't tried playing videos on it, so I can't comment on that feature.

That being said, there are a few things that prevent me from giving this 5 stars.

1. The adjustable stand is made of cheap feeling plastic. I've seen other frames that have much nicer backs. Yes, I know it's the front you are looking at, but the stand should be sturdier, in my opinion.

2. The angle of the stand, while adjustable, is simply held in place by friction. It actually has one setting that it can click into, but then it is angled too much to view at a normal position.

3. There seems to be a software bug that causes the display to act weird in slideshow mode. Well, to be more precise, if you are in slideshow mode and you choose either the Fade, Mask, or Cross Comb transition effects, then the very top horizontal pixel line starts to show black sections. It looks like dead pixels, but once you exit the slideshow (or use other effects other than then ones I listed) everything is fine. I have recreated this problem, but I don't know if it's just my frame or all of these. No biggie. I now use no transition effects it is perfect.

4. This is not really a complaint about the product but more about Coby's specs. On their website they state the LCD is 800x480. Great! So I ordered the frame and then resized a whole bunch of pictures to that resolution. However, when I got the frame and started using it, I noticed that all of my pictures had black (blank) bars on both the left and right sides of the picture. It turns out that the resolution is actually 860x480 (which I found out after some trial-and-error). It would have been nice to know this ahead of time to save me from having to re-resize my pictures. Plus, sizing pictures to 860x480 is a really weird ratio... kinda like getting 4x7 prints.

I ordered this from Total Electronics (one of the Amazon vendors) and it arrived quickly. When I reported the "dead pixel" problem (which turned out to be a software bug, not a defect, so to speak), they responded to my email quickly and offered to take it back no questions asked. Now that's customer service!

Overall, I am very pleased with this product. In reality, it rates 4.5 stars. I'm the type of person that agonizes over something before finally buying it. With this purchase, that was totally unncessary!

I just got this camera recently along with the printer. Setting up was very simple. The only problem I came across was putting the ribbon in the printer. You have to use your finger to remove the slack from the ribbon but it's not that easy. When you put the ribbon in the printer it gets caught on something and could damage the ribbon. It takes time and tons of patients to get that ribbon in the printer. The pictures come out very nice and print even better. I washed a couple of pictures to test the quality and they came out flawless. This camera is a value and shouldn't be passed up. The screen on the camera is huge and the buttons take some time to get use too. If you have any further questions feel free to comment them and I'll reply as possible

 I bought this sweet little thing because I am planning a day in NYC and don't want to bring along my regular camera, which is bulky. This camera is nice and small and would fit in any purse or coat pocket. It has 5 MP and a 3X optical zoom which is great for the price. The pictures I took outside turned out outstanding. Inside pics were a bit pixelated, but I may have had the settings wrong. The camera is easy to use right out of the box.

Perfect for a second camera to keep on you just in case

I have received this camera for serveral weeks. It's a good long zoom digital camera. I can use it for 18x optical zoom when I set its photo size less than 3M EZ. the photo isn't blur as I use image stabilized. The picture is sharp. Image quality is good. However I have to set the ISO at 100 or 200. When the ISO is 400 or above, I can see the noise, and the picture lose detail. But every camera has its own defect. Overall, I am satified with this camera, and I am enjoying using it to take pictures.

I bought this camera six months ago for my 12 year old daughter.  It was her (and ours) first digital camera.  I read so many reviews prior to selecting this model.  The reviews for this camera were so helpful.  This camera has been so easy to use and it takes excellent pictures.  Rechargeable batteries are definitely a must! This camera is the best camera for this price, no doubt about it.  We have taken still shots and videos.  It is so fun to have the option to take a video.  We have some great clips.  All I can say is we are so happy with the camera.  We would definitely choose it again

This camera is an exelent camara. It has plenty of effects, plenty of modes, plenty of scenery options. The image quality is 3.2 megapixel, but its quite good. The pictures you take without the flash do end up getting a bit blury, where as if you take it with the flash, it comes out exelent. And sometimes it takes a long time for the picture to get taken with out the flash, and sometimes it happens imediatly. But all these flaws are only with my version.

But if you are looking for a good camera with a great price, this is your best option

Because of it's non-intrusive red lighting, and especially because of its size and brightness control, this is the perfect little light to bring out in to the field for observing.  One caution; make sure you have the lanyard securely around your wrist, especially if you're shining the light down a tube to collimate.  One slip, and it'll be headed toward your primary

I bought these for a trip to Costa Rica and used them every day. They are comfortable, easy to focus, and a great choice for the price. These are perfect for folks like me who are interested in casual use for travel, concerts, sports, etc

I purchase this lens for the Digital Rebel XT body I also purchased through Amazon.  So far the lens has performed as expected.  It is solid and well built.  Sticks slightly, when zooming through 200mm.  Images are crisp and focus is sharp.  Working at 300mm can be a challenge without using a mono or tripod.  Shooting a bird in flight at 300mm is a trick. 
Overall, good lens for  $200.  If you have more money, then a lens with Image Stabilization (IS) would be the way to go.

I received one of these for Christmas...so I've had it for 6 months now.  I've taken thousands of shots with it, on both a Canon Digital Rebel XT (350d) and a Canon EOS 20d.

The bottom line...I really like the lens.  Although you must learn to to optimize its use at 200MM.

Specifics...

1)  At 200MM (Max telephoto), you will see some blur if you don't use a high shutter speed and hold it steady.  This means that just placing your camera on the green "point and shoot" mode, or even "P" mode may not give you a fast enough shutter speed to keep from having blur unless you are in bright daylight.  So....here's my technique:  at 200MM you may want to bump up your ISO (film) speed to 400 or 800, then use Tv mode (Canon settings I'm talking about - manual shutter speed control) to get a fast shutter speed.  I also hold the end of the lens (the petal filter) with my left hand and lean against a solid object or have a good foot stance - or use a tripod.  All of this is not any sort of lens defect; rather, it is typical of using a long tele lens that does not have Image Stabilization (IS).  You can get IS from Canon, but be ready to lay down some $$$ and carry multiple lenses...more on that later.

2)  Noisy autofocus.  Yeah, true, it is louder than other lenses, but so what.  It is not any louder than the fake autowinder sound my Rebel XT makes.  I find its focus quick and accurate - except in low light.  Although, I will say my 20d does much better than my 350d did with this lens in low light.  But, honestly, I don't think the low light autofocus is any worse than the Canon 18-55 kit lens I initially ised.  IT hunted a lot too in low light, and often would not lock - necessitating manual focus.  Perhaps it is the camera, not the lens.  Regardless, manual focus on the Sigma works great in low light, or, to keep autofocus, you can use an external flash for IR focus assist and it locks right up.

Other than the Tamron, you WILL NOT find as versatile a lens as this one, especially at this price point.  Optical quality is great on my lens.  You can do better - but with two lenses.  My solution to have this kind of range if $$$ was no object would be the Canon EF-S 17-85MM f4-5.6 IS USM and the Canon EF 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6 DO IS USM...this would add image stabilization and 100MMs more range, but at much more cost, and you would have to carry two lenses.

I specifically bought this lens to have a compact, one lens solution.  If you read all the reviews you can find, the general consensus is that the Sigma is better than the Tamron 18-200.  Plus, the end barrel does not rotate, so you can use a circular polarizer.  Show me a lens that has better bang for the buck in a one lens solution, and I'll buy it.  Until then, I love my Sigma

This is a great product. I wish I had not waited so long to purchase it. You must be aware that it only works with L type batteries. I though that it would work with P or M types, which is what I have for 2 Sony camcorders. I had to then purchase an L battery (NP-F970). My old camcorder that uses P batteries is able to charge L batteries as well. Do your homework with the batteries

My Sony FX1 has great low light capability, 3 lux, but eventually you WILL need extra light. Using your software to lighten dark shots will likely reveal some degree of graininess, no matter which camera you use.

I'm so glad I bought it.  Used it for my birthday party. Though the overhead light was good, dark corners of the room require more light. If you consider yourself advanced, semi-pro, or a pro videographer, you MUST HAVE a light.

My only major beef is it runs at either 10 or 20 watts. No variable for 5, or 15.  It is worth getting a long life battery like the NP-970. Independent power source (battery) is a plus. But no outlet plug adaptor that I know of

As a novice astronomer I really enjoy the sharp, steady view with these binoculars. The view is fairly steady even with the I.S. off - depending how stable you are of course. My binoculars cost more than my telescope !! And my telescope is a decent one too. But I think they are worth it. You see so much more in the night sky than what the naked eye can see - by far. They are of course great during the day too. Their weight is not much of an issue for me, although each person is different depending on their viewing habits. I think a hard carry case would have been the best but it's not a big deal for my use. I recommend this pair of binoculars to anyone who is serious about great quality and performance

This is only the second pair of binoculars I've owned but I've used many pairs before from low end to relatively high end ones like Nikons and Leicas.  I can say without hesitation that the Canon 18X50s have met all my expectations for clarity, build quality, and ease of use. They are still quite heavy so, you won't be holding them too long in one position but, the stabilization feature provides a stable, gitter free image. In my opinion, this feature makes up for optics that may not be in the same league with the high end stuff: the Canon 18X50s have more usable magnification for the money for non-tripod, hand held applications. 

While this is not a scientific comparison, this is an example of the useability and magnification: I was at the beach looking at a parasailer in the distance - with the naked eye (20/20 for the record), I could see the chute pattern and a black speck below it; with my old Minolta 10X50s (jittering in my hands)I could make out shapes of heads and legs; with the Canon 18X50s, I could clearly see two people, a man and a child as well as the chute's cords - pretty impressive.  

My only two gripes that have also been mentioned before are: no lense caps and the eye cups are stiff, fit poorly (to my face any way) and are uncomfortable. I find it better to fold the cups back for "eye glass" use even though I don't wear glasses.  Other than that, I am very pleased with this purchase and would also highly recommend purchasing from Adorama Camera - they are quick, accommodating and responsive.

I purchased an off brand to use with my FXF-10 when this case was on back order.  It was terrrible, so I ordered this case and am thoroughly pleased.  The camera fits perfectly into the case and, although it is described as a "soft case," it is durable and will protect your camera with style without adding additional bulk

This lens is fairly inexpensive and the reason for that is while it definitely lets you get really close and the image is definitely larger than without it, the fact is the FZ7 and the FZ30 macro settings are already so good that the image is perhaps 15% or so bigger than without it.  If I can I'll post a couple flower images to permit comparison with and without the lens. The camera I have is a FZ7.  Because I want as large an image as possible of my focus I am very happy

I have sticked with Sony since I got my first digital camera 4 years ago and Sony camera has been the moneys worth! This one DSC-T10 is the one for the parent who is carrying to much already and needs to pack down for a change. It fits in my purse and still have space for more, the only thing to remember to buy a slim fitting case for the camera and an extra battery(for those kind of battery are not sold everywhere) you need that one when you don't thing you need an extra battery, you always run out at the wrong time.
I recommend this one

This case is great for the quick day outings.  It is rugged and keeps the camera safe.  My wife can throw it in her purse and I don't have to worry about it getting banged up and she doesn't have to worry about it being too bulky.  Everyone should have two batteries with any of the Canon cameras since their battery meter only shows up minutes before it goes dead.

When the ETX-90PE works, it works very well and makes astronmomy an easy hobby to get into.  Let me elaborate.

First, the best telescope is the one you use most often.  All too frequently people buy big telescopes that are heavy to carry, and that need frequent adjustment.  The little ETX weighs less than 20 lbs all set up (including tripod), and never needs adjustment.  It encourages frequent use.

Second, one of the most challenging aspects of astronomy, especially for the newcomer, is finding objects to look at.  If you are not familiar with the night sky and where things are located, it can get very frustrating spending up to 30 minutes just to find one object to look at!  The ETX's built in computer makes finding objects easy - just select what you want to see from a menu, and the scope will automatically point to it.

The optical quality of the ETX is excellent.  The manufacturer, Meade, does a very good job of turning out optical systems that rank with the best.  Some of the most rewarding objects - the Moon, Jupiter, Saturn, and the Orion Nebula look wonderful through this telescope.

One final positive to mention is the ease of setup.  The PE models are the easiest of all telescope to get up and running.  Just turn on the power, press one key on the hand held computer controller, and in a few moments the telescope will start aligning itself so that it will automtically find objects for you.  You don't need to worry about where north is, or what the current date, time, and location are.

Now some cautions.  First, the ETX-90 is a small telescope, and will not show as much as a larger one.  That is the trade-off with getting a portable instrument.  There are larger ETX models that are almost as portable, so these might be a consideration.  Also, understand that there will be a learning curve when using the built in computer.  It's not hard, but you need to have some patience while you learn the procedure.  Finally, be prepared for some quality control issues.  As good as the optics are, some ETX's have some mechanical problems that require a return to the factory for warranty repair.  My own ETX-90PE had to go back to the factory twice.  But once all the problems were fixed, it was well worth it!  On this note, you can purchase an extended warranty from the manufacturer at a reasonable price, and I would recommend doing so

Due to a canoe accident on vacation, mine went completely underwater for at least 5-10 seconds. But - only a trickle of water got inside. Once that dried out, much to my surprise, both the AF and VR functions worked fine. All that's left is two small water spots on the inside of the objective lens (Okavango Delta water is clean!).

I needed a tele lens to complement my D50 purchase.

A didn't want to spend too much money on it but I needed one that a least matched my Lumix FZ10 in sharpness.

This certainly did and the VR really works, I am able  to take sharp pictures up to  1/40.


My d50 flies on it

I would like to add to the reviews already posted, especially for anyone considering this lens as an alternative to the 80-400 VR.  This is one of the only times I can remember when I have had the money to buy a Nikon lens, but have not been able to bring myself to do it.  The 80-400 is 6 years old, uses ancient mechanical (slow) focus, and has yet to be updated with VRII technology.  All that, and it still costs more than the pro-quality Canon 100-400 IS, which has Canon's AF-S equivalent too!  That said, I like long yet portable lenses, and after giving myself fits decided to "settle" for the 70-300 because it has VRII and AF-S.  If you are in the same boat then buy this lens, it is a gem for its intended purpose.  I get sharp results wide open at 300, and the light weight more than offsets the slower apertures.  I would have LOVED this lens if it was an f/3.5, but even at 4.5-5.6 I have really been surprised at the results.  Save the $1000+ until Nikon updates the 80-400 dinosaur

This digital camera is awesome. I have no problem with the batteries.  I made sure I put the good batteries in (no cheap ones).  I looked at purchasing a canon and a hp but the features it had on this one was outstanding and for the price.  I purchased this camera with the 1GB card with it.  I can't wait to start using it when I go to San Diego in March.....  Awesome digital camera......  You won't be sorry on this purchase...

I see a lot of people have had trouble tracking baseballs with this thing.  I've owned one for 3 years and it works pretty well.  I will give some tips on it:

!!!If you throw at a respectable speed, and don't follow the correct procedure it will not work - there will be no reading!!

1) Don't stand behind a metal fence.  The Chain links with the plastic coating over them will work, but for whatever reason exposed metal interferes with the signal.

2) The focus beam of the radar gun is very narrow.  The whole idea is to keep the beam on the ball as long as possible.  Just having the ball pass through the radar beam is not enough.  You need to keep the beam on the ball for practically the whole pitch.

3) Use rechargable batteries... and this isn't to save money.  Some of the better Energizer rechargable are high amperage, 1350 mA and up.  The gun tends to respond better to this, as its pretty power hungry.  You will get more consistant readings with better batteries.  Non-rechargable batteries cannot provide the same level of current (usually 850 mA or less), which seem to effect the gun.

So, how would you properly use the gun?

One way is to stand behind the mound as the pitcher throws.  Forget about using it during a game, behind the backstop.  It wont work.

Try line up the pitchers release point and the plate, then situate your gun so that it fires on this imaginary line (connecting pitchers hand and the target.  

You may have to slightly change the angle of the gun to track the pitch, which can be slightly tricky.  Follow the ball with the gun as long as you can.

For a sure fire way to clock a throw, get a cheap net and stand behind it.  You will register it every time.  You will also have the most accurate reading

This is a pretty accurate radar gun for baseball, as far as I can tell. If you follow the directions, and are as close to the action as possible, and at a "straight on" angle, it looks like its correct in the + - 1 mph statement. However, this is a cool gadget, but if you are serious about "speed" and would like more versatility, then your going to have to go with the official MLB JUGS gun...but at a much higher price.

good luck

Bought this tripod to use with my spotting scope for target shooting. Easy attachment to my scope and multiple adjustment heights, with the crank, make it easy to zero in on the target and allow anyone to see thru the scope, no matter how tall they are. Compact and lite to carry, makes it easy to transport to and from the range

I bought this camera to replace a high MP Sony pocket camera, and I am thrilled with it.  The picture quality is absolutely gorgeous in any lighting.  The red eye reduction really works, and gets rid of the red-eye before it ever gets to the memory card.  It has a compact flash card memory system, which is great because big compact flash cards are much more afforadable than the other types of cards.  This camera is better than my brother's Canon SLR in terms of picture quality, but not nearly as bulky and cumbersome.  The battery life is fantastic.  One other nice feature is the screen at the top of the camera which lets you see how many pictures you have, and the batter life, mode, etc without opening the screen.  The only drawbacks to this camera are (1) not the biggest zoom lens, but plenty enough for the typical photographer, (2) the screen could be bigger, but still acceptable, and (3) when you have the screen open, you can't use the viewfinder, which is a little annoying, but not a big deal.  I have owned 4 other high-end digital cameras and this is by far the best one I have ever used.

For the price, you get a lot out of this camera. 6X zoom Stabilized,  the images comes out great at full zoom (2 stabilization mode).  The aid of a histogram will tell you the right exposure to set for your picture.  The multiple program modes, just about lets you take a great picture under different situation! Controls are easy to use and get to. In all definitely a great buy for the price.  The down side is that movie mode has no sound but if that is a factor then get the DMC-LZ5 or a camcorder.

Easy to learn, takes very good photos in well-lighted areas but you DO need to use the flash for dimmer environments - its low-light capabilities aren't that great. Very fast readiness time from the moment you switch on the camera - a bit slow to recharge from a flash, though, and there's a bit of a lag when you press the shutter button to when the photo is actually taken (not so great for fast action shots, even though it touts a "sports" mode). It's a good beginner's camera, a good pocket-style camera, but certainly not to be mistaken for a high-end unit.

set the diffusion to 'stun' when you don't want your flash to 'kill' with harsh, sharp, shadowy edges. yes, you need this if you have an sb-600. why? nikon doesn't make a diffuser for that model. basically, it fits snugly on the tip of the flash, slides off and on easy, will also protect your flashbulb from acidental nicks, like that macro shot of the benihana chefs. here's what it does: diffuses your flash without having to go all into your menu settings and make adjustments. simple, Sherlock. the omni-bounce (what an imaginative name for a piece of shaped plastic) performs as expected, no real cons, except shipping adds almost 50% to the price, so check your local camera shop to see if they have it in stock before ordering

This diffuser is the same quality as the one that comes with the Nikon SB 800 flash.  It is much better than other aftermarket diffusers that require velcro.  This is made to fit the SB 600 perfectly.  It snaps on and off easily.  Angled at 75 degrees it provides excellent fill. I use it on the SB 600 set up as a slave with the SB 800 for fill and back lighting.  It should have been included by Nikon as original equipment but is inexpensive and cost effective.  Much better than the built in plastic flat diffuser

This seemingly simple piece of molded plastic was recommended to me by a professional photographer.  Basically it's the shape of an open box that slides firmly onto the flash.  It is small and sturdy enough to stash in your camera bag without worrying about damage.  When used the light disperses more evenly and is less harsh on the subject being photographed.

The white box is for general use.  Also available are the green Omni-bounce for florescent lighting and the gold Omni-bounce for a warming effect.

PROS:
Inexpensive solution for better flash photography.
A quality product that works.

CONS:
Non

We love this camcorder!  We bought it because our other bulky, digital video that uses tapes, which we would have to copy onto VHS/DVD, stopped working.  We didn't want to spend a lot of money.  We loved the idea that it was easier to carry in my purse and you could download it straight to the computer or burn it (which is very simple to do, and you do not have to download any software.)  I have to admit I was a little reluctant that the quality of the picture would be less than great, and only 60 minutes concerned me, but the pictures is great and I haven't ran out of time yet.  We have used this indoors, outdoors and have no problems.  We have recorded our son's basketball games and it worked great.  We read where the batteries didn't last very long, but we have been using rechargeable batteries and have been impressed with lifetime they have.  This is a must for those who have children or grandchildren

I really enjoy my Photosmart R725.  It's small, easy portable, takes wonderful photos, and is very versatile in terms of settings.  I just have one thing I don't like about it, and that's the fact that there is no viewfinder.  There is an LCD screen on the back which acts as a viewfinder, but it's hard to see in bright sunlight, and I'm afraid that it will eventually become scratched beyond use.  For now, it's great but I'm not sure how it will hold up for the long run.  At the same time, it's not spendy, so it might be worth it

Outstanding camera in every respect. I've owned several digital cameras in recent years (Sony & Nikon). The N2's giant 3" LCD, the touch screen features, lens optics, and overall ease of use top any of my previous cameras. I use it for both land and underwater photography and it performs flawlessly.

I bought this flash to use on a light pole with a flash trigger when we shoot weddings.  Rather than use one of my Canon 580's, I thought this was a better use of my $$-since I use this additional light in manual mode anyway. It does the job for under $10

For the price it is a very good value especially with the capability of bouncing the flash in several directions.  Using the internal flash either left dark or washed out images at times.  This flash solves the problem.  I've dealt with ADORAMA several times and it was a pleasant experience.  Items were sent quickly

This flash is the perfect back-up for a studio, or Main/flash fill for an amateur studio.  I use several w/slaves and lines and the images rival set-ups that cost thousands of Dollars.  I like that they are light and easy to pack and transport.  They are reasonably priced.  They have been around for a long time and do not have bells and whistles.  The SUNPAK has auto/f-stop and manual.  If you are a real photographer, you will know how to use them.  The down side is that if your SUNPAK is plugged into a wall, it takes far too long to recharge (sometimes 3-5 seconds).  Rechargeable batteries seem to work the best with 1-3 second recharge times between flashes.

I enjoy the convenience of a point and shoot digital camera.  My Minolta Dimage X (about 15% small in size than this camera) had reached the end of its useful life, having been around for about 5 years.  The Minolta had a 3/4" screen on the back.  (this one has a 2.5" screen- great colors)

The best feature I liked about my old camera was the fact that there was not a telescoping zoom lens.  I don't like the fact that a part that needs to move so often has the possibility to get gummed up and dirty.  Therefore, I was excited that this camera had an internal zoom.

Tonight I was at a Bulls game, in the 300 section (nose bleed), and was able to zoom in and get a individual photo of Kirk Hinrich.  The 3x optical zoom is incredible, but more so incredible is the digital zoom.  I was also able to zoom into the jumbotron, and it looked as crisp as if I was taking the photo directly. 

Action shots are GREAT. Low light shots are GREAT!  

It is exactly what I was looking for

I bought this camera around the beginning of July and have used it several times already.  I've upgrade from a Nikon Coolpix 3200 to this one due to smaller, sleaker size and more megapixels.  This camera takes excellent pictures, in broad daylight as well as in the dark.  Red eye reduction is wonderful, however the flash does go off about 4 or 5 times.  It's not broken... it's supposed to do that for everybody who thinks their camera has a glitch.  Overall, I think this was definitely a good buy and am looking forward to taking the camera on vacation!

It was time to upgrade my 2.0 MP Canon PowerShot S200 which is more than three years old (ancient in a digital world) to a camera which takes higher quality pictures. The newer Canon cameras had a larger screen, but it was basically the same camera. After a month, I am still pleased that I purchased the Nikon CoolPix S6:

+ push button to switch between camera versus play modes (versus a toggle slide which is hard on the nails)
+ easy-to-navigate mode and menu options with flywheel like an iPod
+ no telescopic lens = no annoying zoom sound during focus, on/off, less wear-and-tear on the most vulnerable component

Before I get K10D, I experienced with Olympus E-500, CANON XTI, Nikon D80.
I used Olympus E-500 to take lots vivid color pictures that I love very much, but no water resistance and no second Display window, also only 3 focus point makes it not so enjoyable. Same thing happen to Canon XTi, no water resistance and no second Display window make it little hard to use when you need to change settings. The Nikon D80 is a great camera but also have no water resistance and shake reducer build in on camera, the color tone of D80 isn't the kind that I would love. Finally I bought Pentax K10D, the feeling of the body,the water resistance, shake reducer,auto dust remove,vivid color tone,etc...makes me feel the K10D is the way to go. Only complaint would be the Limited Edition Lens are hard to get. Get it while you can

I purchased the Pentax K10D digital SLR about four weeks ago, and am very happy with this camera and the two lenses--18-55mm and 50-200mm. With the shake reduction and anti-dust features, You can`t go wrong. If you went with Canon or Nikon, you would pay through the nose for their lenses. The construction is very solid with seals that help prevent dust and water entering the camera.The features of the K10D make it a joy to use. I would highly recommend this camera to anyone moving up to a digital SLR. I am age 81, so it`s never too late to move up the ladder. W.C.RHYN

The enclosure has a solid feel to it.  I dove with it three times with no problem at all. It would be nice if the weight does not cost extra.  
The only compliant I have is that the enclosure is a tight fit, so it is very difficult to fit a desiccant into the enclosure

I love this camcorder. It is very easy to use, the piture quality is great. You can record wide screen or full screen. Light weight, fits in the palm of your hand which is more stable and less shaky when taping. The controls are within easy reach while taping. It is so easy to use that both of my kids have even been using it and they are only 9 and 6. It is also a great price. Can't wait for all our summer vacations to start taping. 

I bought this camcorder two weeks ago from best buy. I just wrote my review and then read the others and I had to add this in, there were comments being made that you can hear the tape while recording and then in the play back. I slightly hear the noise when I am taping, but I cannot hear it when I am playing it on my dvd player. To hear the noise while taping you have to have it right next to your ear. But not noticable on the playback on computer or through the dvd player

  I am writing to offset some negative opinions on this unit. I bought the Canon because it has facilities for an external mike. I am a new camcorder user and so have no practical experience to bias my opinion one way or another. First on the matter of tape drive noise: yes I can hear it if I put the unit up to my ear. But no noticeable noise comes up on actual movie clips when played back through my computer. Second, they claim you can interconnect and capture clips to your computer. What they don't tell you is that you need a Firewire card and cable (about $70.00 total at Best Buy). You cannot simply hook up through the available computer USB port. Fortunately, Microsoft provides the necessary drivers in the XP OS and minimal capture software called "Moviemaker". 

 I am not too pleased with the tape system but considering the price of the unit, I think it is a bargain. Finally, I have become aware through short experience with the unit that the ergonometric design for the right hand was very well thought out. Your thumb easily controls on/off and tape transport functions. It is really easy to use, at least for right handed users. All considered, I am satisfied with the product. Of course, if it dies next week, I will have a different opinion

I am just an average guy when it comes to using a camera. Probably below average. I started trying to use 100% Sony electronic products because my computer was a Sony and Sony-Sony linkages make for easy use. Given that, here is what I think of the product:

1. It is amazing how much camera you can get for the money. Compared to just 6 months ago, or a year ago, this is a lot of camera for the money. It is very small, fits easily in your pocket, but takes great pictures. Also, it is very easy to use and recharge. 

2. A visit to the Sony website, suggests that Sony has new cameras coming out constantly -- new cameras that are very similar.  This makes it hard to compare cameras, even within the Sony brand, and makes you feel as if your camera is obsolete the minute you buy it.

3. A problem with this camera, given it is so small -- do not shake. Your pictures will be blurry. I am a typical guy, with very little fine motor control. My hands have trouble holding small objects. Holding this camera in one hand and taking a picture -- well the results are not pleasant.

4. I tend to be disappointed by the telephoto capabilities of these small cameras. I guess if you really want to zoom in, then you have to go to a big camera. But it still seems like the small cameras could offer more.

5. Having said all of that, in the end, this camera is small and easy to carry, light weight, durable, and it is also easy to use. When you look at it, it looks well made. I ended up giving the camera to my in-laws, because they lost theirs. My in-laws tend to be technologically challenged. I said to them, just leave the dial set to the little green camera, and snap away. I have to say - they love this camera. 

Overall. For the money, a great purchase, technology is amazing. Just grab it with two hands or develop a steadier aim than I have.

This lens hood designed specificaly for the Coolpix 5700 is a must-have accessory.  It does more than just protecting the lens, which it certainly does, esp. for those busy moments when you might bump the front of the camera on something solid.  (Don't forget Murphy's Law.)

But the lens hood can also improve your picture quality.  As with SLR lenses, the hood prevents light from entering the camera lens from the sides and enhances the sharpness and contrast of the picture.  This is especially true outdoors when the light is diffused (scattered).  Just use this all the time (see exception below) and your pictures out of the 5700 will be at their best (all other factors being equal, of course).

The only times you should *NOT* use the hood is when you use the built-in flash on the 5700, esp. indoors when the flash is used as the main lighting source.  The hood will block the flash and cast an ugly shadow on your nearby subject.  Even outdoors when you use the built-in flash for fill-in light, you should remove the hood first to avoid uneven exposure.

Get the hood today to improve your pictures and protect your camera

We bought this camera because our other digital camera (SONY DSC-H1) was too large to carry around a lot of the time. We took it skiing with us (Whistler, BC) and it took some outstanding pictures, both of persons and of landscape/scenery. It is small enough that you can pretty much carry it anywhere, anytime. Others may disagree, but the touchscreen menu controls are easy to use and fairly intuitive. Fingerprints do get on the screen but you hardly notice them and they are easily removed (or better yet, use the little wand they give you with the camera instead of your fingers, that doesn't leave any marks on the screen). To summarize: this is an excellent camera, very small size but with a large 3" LED display, takes EXCELLENT pictures, and the touchscreen menu is easy to use and intuitive. Most people will be very happy with this camera if they buy it. The only negative thing is that this camera does not have a view finder, but unless you have very bright sun at your back this isn't too much of a problem.

This is a camera that is very very easy to use. I was amazed by the colour quality even at a very low light. I took a movie at my nephew's theater play and I am the contrasts and crispness of the picture are just perfect. The zoom is also very clear and crisp. Putting it onto my iMovie was also a piece of cake. 
The only down point is that the still image mode is worthless, but if you need that you should buy the next level up which has a memory card slot.
I highly recommend this camer

I have had several digital cameras and this tops them all!!!!  Everything they say about it, is true.  I love not even having to think about batteries, I didn't believe what people said about the battery life, and I was just happy I didn't need to think about batteries, but I just got married and my 13 year old daughter took more than 100 pictures with this camera and her pictures are almost as good as the photographer I hired and yes the camera battery lasted all day and thru the next 4 days on our honeymoon with another 200 pictures taken, no low battery light!!!!!  I even going to buy my parents one.  Also, one more note I love how fast you can take pictures, no wait 4 seconds between shots.  I had a Kodak digital before only 1 1/2 years old and hated it, I hated the download procedure, it didn't put your pictures onto your hard drive, but in it's own little cubbyhole and trying to attach them to your email was absolutely a nightmare, you'd have to identify the picture copy it to your desktop, remember what you called it and then attach it your email.  This is the main reason why I purchased this camera.  I will never own anything else, especially a Kodak.

For years now I have been buying "bargain" cameras with the foolish notion that I did not need a nice one. Finally, I got sick of it and bought the Exilim EX-Z600. This camera is awesome. The screen is huge, the picture quality is great, it is easy to use and is sooo small. Overall, a great buy.

The one downside is that I can only connect it to my computer using the dock. Luckily, I have an SD card reader, so I normally just use that to download my pictures

I bough this waterproof case for a trip to St. Thomas over Christmas.
The photographs that we took came out perfect.  The flash diffuser worked well, by eliminating the air bubbles that normally are captured with underwater cameras.  Make sure that you set up your camera to the underwater mode so that it automaticlaly adjusts your color balance.  
The only problem that I had was since it is so compact, I often accidently would move the switch to movie mode.  This ruined a few photographs, but also made a great movie of a sea turtle coming up for air. 
I know that it was expensive, but much cheaper than buying a new camera or buying multiple disposable underwater cameras and having X-ray machines fog up the pictures

I bought this underwater housing in anticipation of a trip to the Galapagos.  It worked perfectly, and I obtained some really incredible shots, both still and video.  The combination of the Canon SD550 and this housing were amazing.  I did make sure to lubricate the primary o-ring each time I opened the housing.  But the need to do so was reduced by using a larger, 1GB memory card - both card and battery would last a little over two dives, before I need to change one or the other

I'm a long time Canon user and love the cameras but the lack of image stabilization on this one has me looking for an upgrade.  I can take decent pictures but if anyone else uses this camera, the pictures are fuzzy.  Take a look at one of the newer Canons with image stabilization and I think you'll be happier.

I dropped the camera from 2 feet and the metal outer rim of the lens slightly became bent and won't close. After some time spent tring to bend the metal back in place, I finally was able to close the lens. 

Besides that, it is an awesome camera. I am able to pick out a color (ex. red) and take a picture with that color standing out and everything else black and white. No photoshop needed

Kodak V705 Black: Small, can carry in pocket. Wide Angle Lens,great for group photos. Fast start up time. Video mode is easy, built in mic picks up all the sounds.Camera can stitch 3 photos together-great for vistas. I am happy with this camera. Bought another  V705 in silver for my friend and she loves it.Kodak makes easy to take photos.
Weak flash- try  not to be more than 6-8 feet away-or use photoshop on photos

I bought a spare battery for my D70s and charged it up one time. Since then, I have been waiting to use my spare but the original (charged hundreds of pictures ago) has been going strong for, literally, months.

Follow the directions. Don't use it until your fully charge and don't recharge until it's run down. This will help maintain battery life.

Good product from a great company

This is a great buy if you are just wanting to have some fun, with no real investment.  Although it does go beyond 17 feet, and that is not as far as you may think.  But, I used it while snorkeling and the pictures turned out great, and i am sure a few were more than 17 feet.

Like others I have compared it in a SCUBA diving trip to the Kodak Max Sport and this one had a few advantages:
1. Film winded at greater depth.
2. The pictures came out clearer - not grainy and with better colors.

Don't expect too much of it at depths below 8 meters since light won't be enough (I used it on a bright summer day in the red sea). Even at shallower depths colors turn blue/green without use of flash.

I have taken it down to depth of 35 meters and the camera was fine, but wouldn't take pictures at depths below 20 meters.

The pictures I took at shallow depth came out excellent

Pros: Compact, lightweight, portability, easy to use, big screen, good reproduction

Cons: Microphone sensitive to wind, getting used to not having a viewfinder, bad low light performance.

Summary: I picked this camera as an upgrade for my old Canon ZR10. The first reason I chose it was the small size and portability. With a good light conditions, this little beast do its best shots, but in low light conditions this camera disapointed me (specially compared with mi old ZR10). Please don't buy it if you have plans to use it for stills shots because it has a low resolution. 

The included handycam station have all the ports (Firewire, USB, power, video) you need to conect it. 

The big touch screen is a must, because the screen is the only way to access the camera controls (besides some of them in the edge of the screen). 

You can have a camera with more characteristics and better image quality for the same price, but if your concern is the size and portability this will be your best choice in the world of the mini DV format

I purchased this camera to use with my previous church's media ministry, based on my trial use of the VX2000.  That was three years ago.  This camera is STILL running as well as it did when I bought it. I use it upwards of 3 times a week to create content for web and DVD production, plus, I get great digital audio recordings when I plug directly into my current church's sound system.  The ability to tweak audio and video input on the fly is incredible.  Now that I am creating a multimedia team for our church, I've convinced the church to buy one for themselves

This camera is easy to use and makes a good quality recording. Since it is an upper end product, it does have a longer learning curve than more simple models but the effort is worth it for the added features. There are, however, a few quirks which could have been fixed to make this a much more usable piece of equipment.

The provided microphone jack is an 1/8" stereo. In my camera, at least, it is not mounted very securely. When I have an external mike connected, I had to be very careful to make sure that nothing touched it, otherwise, the sound would drop off. A friend with some tools and expertise fixed this problem but it should never have happened.

The master switch moves from off to VCR mode (up one), record to tape mode (down one) or record to stick mode (down two). It is intuitive but very easy to overshoot the mark. This can be frustrating and I cannot help but believe there is a better design that could be used.

The "VCR" controls are located on the top surface of the camera. They are intuitive and employ commonly used symbols. They are also backlit and impossible to discern in sunshine. You can see the symbols but there is no way to tell which, if any, of the functions are selected. It is still usable but it is a pain in the backside.

There are a multitude of things that could be done to make the interface on this camera easier to use but it is usable as it is now.

Reading the reviews of this camera reminds me that cameras are tools.  An imperfect tool in the hands of a master is much better than a perfect tool in the hands of a amatuer.  I am not a master, but I do appreciate this camera for what it can do and what its limitations are.  When you use ISO settings higher than 200 you will see increased noise.  I think it is a great little camera and I have used it a lot on my latest photo project.  Keep in mind one of the assets of this camera is its small physical size.  This also means small optical lens = less light gathering ability.  There is no way to compensate for this in the camera - so know this is a limitation and deal with it.

This camera is the best point and shoot cameras for the money. Just think of what you are getting. Not just a 7.2MP camera, but a LICA lens and technology. Not a bad deal. The images are not bad when printed. On a scale of 0-10, 10 beining the best, I give this camera an 8.

The Nikon S3 has proven to be a good buy.  It is affordable yet takes a quality photo.  In addition this camera is easy to use and fits conveniently in a pocket.  This camera has the ranging ability to take both a simple aim and shoot photo, and at the same time complex skill shots that is complemented by computer editing and redeye reduction.  My only complaint is as a result of the user.  If the camera does not have time to focus, then the picture quality suffers immensely. This camera has only been in use for about two months but has not let me down yet!

This is a very good camera for the price range. I have always had good luck with Sony products, unlike some of the reviewers here. The resolution of the viewer window and the image quality itself is more than what I would expect from a camera in this price range.... it's pretty decent. For what most people use DV cams for, this is camera doesn't suck at all.
I like how tiny it is. It doesn't go much past the palm of my hand when I'm holding it. Also it was very easy to figure out just by exploring the menu on the touch pad. Color graphics & icons on the menus add a nice touch. A beginner could start filming very soon after opening the box, I think. The camera feels sturdy in my hand, I mean I don't feel like the viewer window is going to break off when it's open or that I could easily break the buttons with normal use. 

As others have mentioned, you have to buy a 4 to 6 firewire if you have a mac because the iLink cable that comes with it is a S-video input for TVs. Also the battery that comes with it is the 30 minute battery but I would have bought an extra one anyway because you never want to wait around while your only battery is charging. The software CD is a do-it-yourself install, at least for Mac. It might not be for PC. I'm used to being guided through the installation process... (since at least the early 90's!) but I had to drag the folder to my hard drive my darn self.  A minor thing but I would have expected more from a major company like Sony.
But the reason I give it a 4 star rating instead of 5 is because the firewire goes into the base, not the camera so you cannot have the camera on a tripod while it's connected to your machine. I realize this will not be a big problem for very many people but since I do stop-motion animation and use frame grabbing software, I need to have it connected to firewire and on a tripod in while I'm working. I almost returned the camera when I discovered this but instead I hot glued velcro to the bottom of the base and to my tripod adaptor so I could have the firewire plugged in and attached to the tripod....kinda ghetto. I figure it was worth it though since I got such a good camera for the price (I paid $299 on sale for it.)
If you're looking for a decent but cheap camera I would recommend either this one or the hc42 if you want to shoot in widescreen.

This is my first digital picture frame, so I do not have anything to compare it against.  I am generally very happy with this product - it is very easy to use, and I am happy with the resolution and the picture quality. 

The only downside to this frame is that the instruction manual is not helpful at all, and as one other reviewer noted, I had to learn how to do things by trial and error.  I also do not like that when you make changes to the layout - rotating or deleting images, it is not "saved" to the memory card and so you need to make the changes each time.  

However, I like this product enough to buy more of these for the grandparents this next Christmas

My husband is away (military) and I was looking for the perfect, small but clear, pictures for him.  I didn't care about the frame, only the small white digital system.  I was hesitant, as my MIL has a digital keychain and the picture quality is horrible.  I was pleasantly surprised at the picture quality and the ease of both looking at pictures already on an SD card and transferring pictures from the computer.  I love that I can use either batteries or the included plug.  Everything was soooo easy that I did not even need to read the instructions to begin.  I also purchased the small case to put this in for travel as the album is just an added extra for later.  This is the best investment for anyone looking for something very small and portable.  Perfect to send a military loved one lots of pictures to keep them involved no matter how far away they are!  Then, when he comes home, it's great for a portable album to carry anywhere

Good product, like the price.  This is much less expensive than the current pinseeker 1500 models, I bought it on ebay used for $150 so you may be able to find it for less (look under hunting AND golf rangefinders for this model).  This does not have the pinseeker feature of the newer models but normal mode and scan mode work perfectly for ranging flags that have no reflectors (although you may need to try more than one time and have relatively stable hands).  I was able to range a flag at 270 yards, and was able to range the top of a telephone pole at 375 yards (but it was windy so the flag was straight out and a little cloudy).  I would estimate that this will work for ranging flags on a calm sunny day (these don't work as well on a sunny day because the laser used is a visible light laser and gets a little interference from sunlight) at 215-230 yards for a flag (which is what I need it for).  Less expensive alternative than the pinseeker, and I really like the performance, very impressed.

I bought this camera for my 80 year old mother because I knew that if she was going to try digital photography, it had to be EASY ! The printer dock is simple for her to use to transfer snapshots of her cat to her computer and email them to her friends.   I have used the older CX-7300,( very similar camera) for backpacking for years and it has never failed under harsh conditions. The lack of optical zoom is a plus for me; less to break. The C530 is more compact, has better resolution, and still has the option of using AA batteries when the rechargables die. If you want simple digital snapshots, you will love this little camera

For an all-purpose color film, I nearly always shoot Fuji's 200 speed.  It has the cooler tones that I prefer in my images and a good saturation level.  The only drawback that I've seen while looking at various film prices here is that they are way over-priced!  The only place that I've seen where you pay more for film is in the supermarkets.  Any regular camera store or photo finisher will have this stuff for a lot less, and you won't have to wait for it to ship

I use this film just normally for everyday stuff.  It isn't grainy when you enlarge the photos, and the colors are just outstanding.  I use the 800 for the really important stuff though because I think the colors are more vibrant.  But, for just vacations, stuff around the house, the 400 will do a great job.  Anything less it basically a waste of money.  I shoot at least a roll a week just of everyday life and this is the one that I choose all the time.  I have a basket full

This is a pretty good camera, loaded with lots of features.  The pros include the 10x optical zoom, use of SD card, and battery consumption.  Also, with this camera you have the ability to buy add-ons such as zoom lenses and such - makes it nice for those that are just past beginner experience.

There are a couple of cons that I've found, the most important being the picture quality.  Although it does have the capability to take great photos, you have to make sure and wait several seconds between shots to ensure that they'll come out looking great (in my opinion, anyway).  The size is okay, although it is kinda bulky for being so small.  I prefer something that size to also be slim - it's not so easy to carry around because of this.

Overall, this camera is very easy to use

Have had the camera a short time and have grown to love its features and capabilities. Do purchase the 50 mm-200mm telephoto zoom lens; for the price it is a nice lens.  I tried the image stabilizer by shooting a picture of the air conditioner on my neighbor's roof using 200 mm telephoto.  When you enlarge the image you can read the label for the brand name!  Without the image stabilizer, it is a blur.  I did the same for a book about 100 ft away and using 200 mm setting. Without image stabilizer the title is blurred; with the image stabilizer it is sharp. A very nice feature is you can take an image and then enlarge a portion of it and save, or use filters to make them BW, soft, more bright, or with different color tones.  

People report that under tungsten light the auto setting gives a yellow tone without flash.  This is true.  However, you can use the P mode, which is like an auto mode, reset white balance easily to tungsten light and the picture comes out nice!.  Great low light capabilities with image stabilizer.

If you are into action photography, this may not be the camera for you.  It has limited ability to store a sequence of photos without a delay.  Other camers react faster and have larger capacity.  

Do reset default from bright to natural tone.  You can do this in some modes, but not all.  Read the manual, it really will empower you with many nice capabilities.  Newer lenses are light and small and interface with image stabilization system automatically

Nice portable background support kit.  Stability might be an issue but if portability is your first concern then you can overcome the stability issues with weights or caution.  Easy and quick to put up.  I put it up by myself with very little effort.  All rolls up in a nice compact bag for transporting

I'd love to read a review from anyone who has purchased this camera, the Aiptek Zoom DV-6 MP Image Stabilizing Camcorder w/3x Optical Zoom.  I see the claim that it has 3x OPTICAL zoom and cannot help but question this because I am unable to find this product on aiptek-dot-com and this cam has supposedly been available since July 30th, 2006.  Am wondering what gives with that?  

Please someone, post a review of this model and hopefully, some picture results too.  Let us know about this 3x optical zoom, please!    

I had to pick a rating, so the four star rating was based on the MPVR version of this camera -- which I own and find to be a very decent gadget.  Mine is over a year old and still going strong - no problems with that model.  MP3's sound terrific.  I convert movies for viewing on the camera while on the go and... "wow" for its quality.  I have recorded sounds and more.  Very decent!  Just drag and drop my files from my PC to the SD card and I can switch out movies and MP3's.  I am happy with that model, but it does not have any optical zoom - just digital.  Still get pretty good pix tho, just use the various settings...  My little homemade movies are good, very decent, but without additional lighting, indoor movies will be dark.  This camera doesnt handle well in strong sun - I use an umbrella over my cam as I film.  Big diff.  

So, is this newer model really all that much better?  Can't wait to know!  3x optical sounds good..

After researching several cameras in this price range, I bought the Rebel T2 last month. It has met my expectations and perhaps then some. After recently trying out a friends camera in the 150.-ish range, I partially regret spending what I did. It all comes down to what you need, want, and how many bells and whistles you like. For the money though, compared to the competitors, I still think I made a good purchase. After all, if I use it for ten years, which I most likely will, I will have surely got my moneys worth. Bottom line: no complaints with it

I bought a Canon Powershot A70. They say your best camera is the one you use most, and man I use it. I'm a high schooler, so I dont have much money, but with the A70, I can attach this adapter (LA-DC52C) to my camera, and I can have more photographic freedom with lenses, for alot less money. YOU HAVE TO HAVE THIS ADAPTER FIRST. Then any lense which fits (most), can be used... GOOD IDEA CANON!!!

I so love the size and shape of this camera. This one takes some good pictures, and appear to be quite clear. It's better than the integrated camera on my cell phone. This camera may seem like it's taken a poor quality image, but when you transfer them onto a pc, they seem so clear! However it is recommended that you get a memory card for this camera as it only has 14mb of internal memory. As this camera was a gift to me, I'd have to say it was the best birthday present I have received

i have olny had mine for a month or so but i have made several films with it and it is very inersting. 

but the software is harder to use that movie maker.

but if you are a first time buyer then i would go for this becasuse 20GB is engough to use..

but the battery life is short but u wont need to make a feature length film!!!

it is just fantastic.

Well, this lens does work wonderfully to expand your angle for better shots, but if you don't have good lighting, you end up with pictures that are worthless.  I suggest never using this in poor indoor lighting as the flash that comes on the DX6490 does not clear the top of the wide angle lens and therefore becomes useless.  Best for outdoor shots or areas where overhead and backlighting are sufficient enough to take pictures without the use of a flash.  Plan ahead before just attatching the lens and taking pictures.  Also remember that because you can't use the flash option, you will need to stabilize the camera better to avoid blurry shots.  Otherwise, this lens is excellent.  It fits easily into my camera bag, is simple to attach (with the lens converter of course) and takes great shots without the fisheye effect.  Other than the inability to use my flash with the lens, I think it is great

Multi-element add-on lense used with Kodak DX-7590 provides good wide-angle capability.  Note that this is a very large add-on lense (screws into DX-7590 extension-piece which costs an additional $20).  Does the job well in most portraiture and scenic applications, however two caveats:
(1) Slight curvature of field in extreme corners of wide-angle shots (ie, corners of shots may be noticeably out of focus).   Suggest cropping to 95% of original picture to maintain sharpness across plane.
(2) Size of lense will render pop-up flash and outside the lense focusing system (Ultra-sonic) less functional.

This cable came in a cheap packing and it does not have any logo on it so you can't say which company it belongs to. I have used a lot of sony products and I feel it is not up to the standard of sony. 
It works great had no problems so far. It is flexible kinds so you don't have to worry about positioning your laptop according to your TV.

So far, I really love this camera.  It's very user friendly and gives you the option to put it in a VERY BASIC mode or normal mode.  What attracted me to purchasing this camera was because of the long battery life and because of the picture quality.  It has a large viewing area which is nice and it's very clear.

I've had other 3 digital cameras and this is the best I think, I shots very quick, flash is brighty, and even soft flash for more natural shots.

can browse pictures very fast and is has a lot of posibilities to edit inside the camera, is light tiny and slim.

one of the best cameras.

I don't find a negative feature on it.  I love it

I've had this digital camera for almost a year. It's the fourth camera I've owned. I spent quite some time searching for a compact camera that I could carry everywhere. Being an amateur photographer (and mostly taking pictures for myself and not others), I didn't want to lug around an extra bag just for my camera. It fits discreetly in your pocket or a small purse (for formal nights out). The size and weight of this camera is its best feature, and this carries through to the newer generations of this camera, too. 

This has been the perfect camera for everything from selling items on-line to landscape scenery. My pictures have always turned out beautifully, with wonderful color and crispness. I have discovered that the "automatic" lighting feature is not always the most ideal, but you can re-program just about anything on this camera.  

It's really quite a good camera, and given its price these days with the newer generations out there, it's a steal

After springing for the Cybershot in August so I could have a compact camera I would actually TAKE places, I've been very, very pleased. 

The last camera I had was an older Sony DSC that was quite bulky, ran on batteries, and had shutter problems--but it took great quality pictures and the interface and features were perfect, so I thought I would go for the DSCT5, since it avoids ALL of those problems. Only a tiny battery to charge, no sticky shutter... and it's sexy as hell. The screen is huge and very bright. 

I hate taking pictures with flash in general, and I find that the flash makes nasty redeye more often than not with this camera. (And the camera gives you the impression you cant change shutter speed or anything) However! You can easily change this by going into the over/under exposure options and under exposing your photos when you are in dark environments. They come out surprisingly well and blur-free

I don't think anybody is going to pretend that the little Casio Exilim EX-Z600 6.0 mega pixel camera is the best camera ever built or takes the best pictures in the world.  But for under $[...], it's hard to beat and does everything advertised.

The size is perfect, one of the smallest, slimmest cameras made, easily fitting into one's [...] pocket, even when enclosed in a small case.  The viewing screen is probably the biggest and brightest you'll find, so aiming and shooting is easy as it can be.  The range of modifications (size, contrast, sharpness, saturation, etc.) to taking and managing pictures seems almost endless, yet the various menus the camera offers are simple to navigate.  And the camera's docking stand makes downloading pictures to one's computer as well as charging up the camera a snap.  Moreover, according to Casio, a single charge will afford one up to 500 or more snaps.

Picture quality?  It's perhaps not as absolutely clear and well defined, even at its maximum six mega pixels, as the best cameras; although, to be fair, the best cameras often cost three-to-four times as much as this one.  So, as far as I'm concerned, I've no complaints, and the pictures I've been taking are a delight to the eye.  The Z600 makes picture-taking fun again

This is a great camera- it's so thin, and takes amazing pictures, even when the subject is moving.  The Best Shot option makes taking pictures under any kind of lighting great quality.  I suggest this to anyone

Some reviewers below have said that this microphone doesn't work with the Sony hot shoe.  Wrong.  Click on the "Technical Details" on this page and you'll see the Sony Camcorder models that this microphone works with.

Failure to look at which camcorders are compatable with this microphone is the fault of the customer, not any fault with the microphone!  So don't give it a low rating based on your own lack of research when buying a product, please

This camera case is great.  It's very small and fits my coolpix 4600 perfectly.  There is enough room to fit an extra memory card and some batteries (but the batteries make it tight).  I originally purchased the camera case listed for the 4600, but it was a little bulky and the zipper could scratch the camera if you aren't careful.  This camera case does not come with a strap like the other, but that is something I would never use.  I highly recommend this case for those who want a small sleek case to protect their camera.

This camera was a great investment. the photos turn out wonderfully. better than a regular film camera and I have kept an eye out on simular cameras...price wise we got a fantastic deal on this camera and it was well worth the price. the only problem I have found with it is that the batteries wear out soooo fast but I think all digital cameras have that problem. this is a  great camera

I bought this camera just before a trip to CA and then a cruise!  It is very easy to operate (even for a techno-retard like me) and the pictures turned out great!  I have started to use the filming feature recently as my Video Recorder is with my son @ college and I want to film my daughter's Drill Team performances!  I really like the fact that it doesn't turn on while in my purse!!!  My old camera did that a couple of times, and I ended up with quite a few pictures of the contents of my purse - anyone want one? (LOL) All in all, a great buy!  8 months later and the LCD display is gone!  Literally, GONE!  Don't know what happened - took pictures/movies of daughter's drill team performance, and when I got it out again to take pictures before Sadie Hawkins, it would still take pictures (I just downloaded them) but since the display looks like "a piece of plaid fabric with a marijuana leaf coming in from the right side" I don't know what I'm taking a picture of!  Need to replace soon!  I'm (now) bummed

Celestron's tool is easy to carry, easy to use, and (at least in my case!) gives me quick, precision collimation with my Newtonian.  Why pay for a laser collimator (which needs to be calibrated) when you can use this?

Collimation is the most important part of your setup; without good mirror alignment, all you'll see are blobs and blurs even on the best viewing nights.  This combination tool makes aligning both primary and secondary mirrors fairly painless, and also fairly fast.  Highly recommended for any level of observer

Very good camera. This was a present for my wife as she needed a new camera. She picked it out and liked that it came as a complete kit. Directions can be hard to follow at times and could be printed larger. Takes some getting used to. Zoom lense works great and takes good pictures. Where the on-off button is so close to the shutter, you have to be careful that you don't accidentally shut the camera off. She is very satisfied with it.

I'm pleased with the purchase. I bought this camera just under two years ago when I was getting ready for a trip abroad.

I spent six months in England, with five weeks travelling around Europe with this camera in its case on my belt. It's very sturdy if nothing else, between the trains, planes, hostels, and general bustle I'm very pleased with how well it held up. Nothing on it broke.

I probably took at least 400 pictures during my trip, if not more. Sure I've had to swap out batteries on one or two occasions in the two years I've had it, but my general feeling is that the batteries are holding up quite well.

The zoom on this camera is very nice. It's one of the better zooms I've seen on a simple camera of this type, or at least it was back when I bought it.

It also has several features that older film cameras do not, such as a timer that you can set before running to get in your own picture, or settings to take "Portraits" or "Night shots."

I know that this camera cannot compare to professional cameras, I know that it doesn't have all the frills of the new digital cameras, and I am not trying to compare it to those. I'm not a professional photographer, so I don't know how to use a camera with exchangable lenses and whatnot. I don't want a digital for personal and professional reasons. For a traditional film camera, this one is the best I've ever used.

BOTTOM LINE: Good quality photos, a sturdy build, excellent zoom lens, useful and easy to use features, and long battery life make this camera an excellent choice if you want a traditional film camera with a few perks

I bought this camera more than half a year ago. My intention was to get a decent camera for images, but then also be able to use it for filming short movies.

I'm very pleased with its performance. In good lighting conditions, colors come out to be amazing. I really really did not expect them to be so vivid and sparkling! In darker conditions, well, it still works fine, not nearly as bad as I expected from some other reviews. Photos might be grainy or not as vivid anymore, but the stuff is still perfectly suitable to show the photos to people.

As about filming, it's terrific. I mean, resolution is great (sth like 848 by 640 or so), better than what one could possibly expect from a regular camera. And the quality is super awesome, looks very neat on computer screen. Respect.

It has to be pointed out that you cannot zoom while filming, but not many cameras out there can do that.

Oh, it's also very small with a gigantic screen and great battery life. A great buy

After setting booby traps for Zombies, I like to whip out my Bushnell Waterproof scope and wait for the oncoming herds to trample on in.  This scope is just great because it cuts down on glare and is also waterproof.  It is good to have some foreward advancement of options when dealing with the zombies so when you are set up this scope can give you good range in spotting them on your trail!!

You can even view the craters on the moon.

Plus it's waterproof and comes with two cases and a tripod.

Proving that there's life in the old dog yet, Bushnell have come up with this, the successor to the out-dated, poor-performing Trophy Splashproof Spotting Scope, and I have to say, it's a fantastic improvement. As soon as I took it out of the box I was impressed with its styling, shape, colour, and of course, waterproofness. I set it up in my front room and spent a happy couple of hours watching my neighbours coming and going, and they were oblivious to my surveillance. It's not the most subtle 'scope out there but stick a blanket over your head and you're laughing. Any one who has been caught out in the rain will appreciate this little beauties moulded plastic housing, as water really does roll off it like, erm, water off a duck's back. Stunning

This adapter is the only one available for the HD1 and while it does a good job of protecting the 1st lense with whichever 49 mm one you attach, there is a problem when you use the flash for pictures of things within 10 feet. There will be a dark semicircle on the bottom of your pictures where the flash was blocked by the adapter. I've gotten around this by using the adapter with attached lens and lens cap and having that attached to the string on the camera. whenever I need to take a picture with the flash of something up close (within 10 feet) I pop off the whole setup and take the picture as if the entire piece was a giant lens cap for the regular camera. Hope that helps

I liked this lens. I used it, for the first time, while traveling through Peru. It was light-weight and easy to use. At 200mm, most of my pictures turned out great, especially when I was on steady ground (taking pictures from a rocking boat with no tripod is a bit of a challenge!). I've printed some 8x10's of close-ups I took using this lens and I was quite impressed with the quality. It was also in my price range. Overall, I'd say it was a "good bang for the buck.

I enjoy all the features of this item.

The main compartment that hold the camera is soft and secure. You can open it without worrying about your camera falling off.

The back compartment is roomy enough for all the basic gear. The slot for memory cards 1-4 (depends on the card type), batteries (roomy for four AA), and cables can fit in it.

The shoulder strap is basic and looks flimsy. It's not long enough to hold comfortable diagonally but on the side is good. The belt loop is very secure and can fit on belt three inch in width.

It can even handle the worst environment ever. Hot, dry climate with sandstorms and occasional accidental drops. It has protected my dig. camera very well

After springing for the Cybershot in August so I could have a compact camera I would actually TAKE places, I've been very, very pleased. 

The last camera I had was an older Sony DSC that was quite bulky, ran on batteries, and had shutter problems--but it took great quality pictures and the interface and features were perfect, so I thought I would go for the DSCT5, since it avoids ALL of those problems. Only a tiny battery to charge, no sticky shutter... and it's sexy as hell. The screen is huge and very bright. 

I hate taking pictures with flash in general, and I find that the flash makes nasty redeye more often than not with this camera. (And the camera gives you the impression you cant change shutter speed or anything) However! You can easily change this by going into the over/under exposure options and under exposing your photos when you are in dark environments. They come out surprisingly well and blur-free

I deal in major brand cameras and Panasonic cameras are my personal favorite! I've seen people whine about the "noise" they make many times but have never found it to be a problem. I own the FZ10 and the FX01 for my personal cameras. The FX01 is a very fast camera and takes great pics! I love the 28mm wide lens. Compared to most cameras I've used the FX01 does a real good job of metering the light and exposing the images. 

I love Panasonic's solid build and reliability. They may not be as popular as Canon or Sony but in my opinion are every bit as good.

I bought this for my wife so she could pull out the camera, turn it on, and take a nice photo.  Flash works well, unlike some reviews I've read.  Battery life appears to be fine also.  This is a small, light camera, measuring 3 1/2" wide, 2 1/4 " tall, and 3/4" deep when turned off. Not exactly a credit card, but likely as close to one as you're gonna get.    Camera opens up instantly, takes a nice photo whether with or without flash, battery life appears OK, and controls are easy to use--either in figuring them out or using your fingers on them.  Nice big screen 2 1/4 by 1 1/2, so you can easily see what's going on--a nice plus.  This camera also has a nice "reminder" listing on the right of the display, so you can see flash setting (on, off, etc.), ISO setting for those of you that use that, and VERY NICE way to access the other controls shown for the auto focus, self-timer, antishake, ISO sensitivity, white background (am I losing you yet?), and so on.  One point to remember is that this listing is arranged from most-likely-to-use to least-likely, so the user interface has been a strong consideration in the design of this camera.  

I've gotten some nice pictures with this, with and without flash.  A nice pick.  

Why not 5 stars?  cuz I've also bought a more expensive digital camera that gives me more choices, although for the price this camera is fine and it'd be one I'd buy again, but it isn't the equal of dig cams with 6x optical zooms, separate ISO settings, and all those other techie things that, frankly, aren't that important to a lot of users but which do need to be considered in a rating.

Do buy a carrying case, as I have done, so the camera doesn't get scratched or lost cuz it'z so small. I don't have any "special fear" about this but it's also easy to buy a small carrying case to stash this into, so why not do it?  

As in all my reviews, I have no financial interest one way or the other in what I review.  

Also, don't forget you are likely to want a bigger memory card to store pix, and maybe a second battery to swap out when needed.  Consider these additional costs, but also consider these additional costs apply to any camera you buy.

I have own this camcorder for 6 month
it's a good camcorder, esay to use, easy to bring
As it's design purpose, PC-55 is enough for home use
Only one thing I want to mention here, before I buy this camcorder, I thought that I can record video on MS duo in mepg format, and it's easy for post-edit on PC, you know, tansfer a MiniDV tape to computer may need a huge space to save.
However, when I replay the video which stored on MS, the sreen was full of mosaic
fortunately, when use DV type to record, this situation never happens. good quality.
The one press photo button also becomes useless because the bad quality

I've had this camcorder for a week now and I think it works great .. except for the touch screen feature. That takes a little getting used to .. especially when accessing the special features (such as fader effects) while filming.

The digital still quality is poor when recording directly to the memory stick .. but the same images taken as a still from prerecorded tape is much clearer.

All in all it is a good product .. just takes some getting used to

Great camera . . . one of the few lower priced cams to keep the mic jack and the headphone jack,  but beware . .. . this camera does NOT come with a lens cap, and NO remote control.  other sources state that this camera does NOT have a Leica lens.  This camera does NOT have A/V input.  No flash, no hot accessory shoe (though it has one which has no power).  No widescreen LCD.  It does record in widescreen but no image stabilization in widescreen.

This is my first camcorder, so I don't have much to compare it to, but I've enjoyed it so far. It's easy to use. The picture quality seems high.  The only minor problem I've found is with the headphone input.  Had to try three different sets of headphones before I could find one that would fit into the narrow slot where the headphone jack is

This is one of the best camcorders in the market today and I would definitely recommend it to anyone planning to buy a Mini-DV camcorder 

Positive factors: 
- Very small and easy to hold with one hand. Can be easily attached even to a mini-tripod with ease. 
- Excellent widescreen video and hi-fi audio. Your videos finally get that "Hollywood" feel when you shoot movies in 16:9 ratio (widescreen format). Even if you don't have a widescreen TV currently, you will very soon have one as more and more people are buying them. So its better to buy this camcorder and shoot in 16:9 format to enjoy your movies later in widescreen format. 
- Includes widescreen rotatable LCD so what you see is what you get when you shoot in 16:9 ratio (widescreen format) 
- Good battery life. One extra battery is enough. You can easily manage a day's worth of shooting with two batteries before recharging them again 
- Includes docking station making it easier to connect to computer or TV. If you have a good computer with a firewire port, please buy a firewire cable to connect the camcorder to your computer. You can download your movie in excellent clarity in .avi format and edit it as required 
- Make sure to change the audio setting to 16 bit (instead of the default 12 bit) for very good hi-fi audio 
- Touchscreen menu system is great. You don't have to search for any buttons as they are all available in the touchscreen menu itself. 
- 10X optical zoom is more than sufficient for ordinary home videos. Anything more produces more "shaking" and would necessiate the use of a tripod. When you shoot without a tripod, 10X is the best zoom you can achieve without worrying about shaky videos 
- Widescreen still photo. The photo clarity is OK not too good. So please don't expect great shots. Since the photo is in 16:9 format, you can take panoramic photos and cover more people in group shots 
- Nightshot: Cool feature that records using infrared light. Useful for shooting at night as you can record a video even in 100% darkness 
- Color widescreen viewfinder - Very useful when you are running down on batteries and need to use the viewfinder. The color widescreen viewfinder gives an excellent picture and is as good as the LCD in clarity 

Negative factors: 
- Outdoor videos especially in bright sunlight are overexposed. So please adjust the white balance when shooting outdoors. Add the white-balance menu to your shortcuts so that you can easily access it and return to default once you start shooting indoors 
- Sensitive microphone may pick up button clicks (best to turn off the button click "beep" sound). 

Notes: 
- Use a fresh cassette after recording 2 or 3 times on the same cassette. The head tends to get dirty if you re-record on the same cassette more than 3 times 
- You can edit movies in Windowx XP using Windows Movie Maker, but beware it does not support 16:9 ratio video. Hence your videos look ugly as you shot them in 16:9 but Movie Maker converted it to 4:3. Invest in Pinnacle Software version 9 or 10 for better movie editing capabilities. Pinnacle is the only software, I am aware of, that preserves teh 16:9 ratio. Even Roxio could not allow 16:9 format. 
- You can also invest in wide-angle lens as it gives excellent coverage

I checked the 3CCD from Panasonic and the Canon camcorders. In that price range this is the best I found (if you have the extra money, the new HDV camcorder from Sony might be your best bet!).

IMPORTANT:The CCD issues referred in other user comments are REAL (although I don't know if it will also apply to this new model). It actually happened on my previous Sony. I purchased a 5 years warranty from Sony for my DCR-HC90. 5 years is a good product life so I will take the risk of CCD failure after that period and ENJOY this GREAT product until then!

Great features are: small but feels solid, 3 megapixel pictures (impressive quality for camcorder), incredible low light performance, nice touch screen, great features. Battery life is actually not too bad from original battery but you might need an extra.

What I did not like: CANNOT take full size pictures in camera mode (only in memory mode), limited zoom compared to most new camcorders and lots of required extra (SVideo cable, ILink cable, video light, decent size memory stick, extended warranty). I am still giving this a 5-stars overall.

A great add-on for the Xacti HD1, but two minor problems I've found so far. 1. I can't use a circular polarizing filter with the wide angle lens as it cuts off the corners of a picture and; 2. flash photography won't work as the  pop-up flash becomes obscured by the barrel of the add-on lens

The optical x6 zoom on the Canon A710 IS is already better than cameras in it s range (i.e. non SLR). However, the zoom takes the picture up to the natural size; the tele converter lens really does make a difference. 

Firstly, if there are any negatives, they are very minor; the lens and adapter are black - would have been nice to have been silver to match with the camera. Erm, that's it!

The main quality of Canon is the lens, which they always do well. The clarity of this lens is very good, with very little fuzziness at the edge. It also connects simply the adapter and seems fairly solid when connected. The electronics features help in the overall control of adding the attachment. The tele lens does make a difference for just getting that bit closer to get what you want.

I ordered this hoping that it would fit my camera and accessories and it did. I have a Stylus 750 plus a pop up screen shade, an extra battery, and an extra picture card. There are two slots specifically designed to fit two picture cards on the inside cover. In the main compartment, a small slit will fit an extra battery or two plus a creit card and perhaps a bit of paper money. (It won't fit much more than that, though.) It's compact, stylish and functional--I'm glad I bought it

This is Panasonic's entry-level camcorder, but it's packed with useful features, like good image quality, 12 lux sensitivity, and a whopping 30x optical zoom.  I think it's perfect for casual travel videography as well as for shooting entries to the "America's Funniest Video" show.  It's fairly easy to use and the build quality is solid.

A good optional accessory to get is a spare battery.  You never know if the battery might run out at the most inopportune time, so be sure to pick up a backup one.  Given the recent Dell recall of 4.1 million laptops due to battery fire, you should get a genuine Panasonic LiIon battery designd specifically for this model.  Don't put your life or your loved one's at risk.

The reviewer named "Hung" got it totally wrong (or was just plain lying).  The GS29 does come with IEEE1394 Firewire (aka i.Link) so you can download your videos quickly to your PC; if your PC doesn't already have an IEEE1394 port, you can get a PCI IEEE1394 card for $30 or less.  You can use Windows Movie Maker, included with Windows ME and XP, to edit your videos and export them to CDs or DVDs.

After reading the reviews here and at [...] on this baby, I was a little cocerned about its low-light and indoor performance.  Let me be the first to say that my fears were largely unfounded.

Yes, if you film in very low light, it will darken many colors.  But we're talking 60 lux, which is the roughly equivalent to the light put off from the candles of a birthday cake.  Just keep the lights on when your kid blows out the candles, and viola!  Seriously, I have had absolutely no problems with it filming too dark indoors, outdoors, or even when I film local bands playing in dark bars.

The reason I wanted to try this camera was because it is the only flash-based camera that is receiving even mildly positive reviews.  I do not want a tape mechanism that will break, nor a fragile hard drive that cannot be used in many film-worthy conditions (think snow skiing, as the drive mechanism will freeze up on you in very cold weather).  

As I said, I was skeptical when I purchased it, but no more.  The videos are far better than any other camcorder I've owned.  My last was a Canon ZR 50 mini DV, and this camera takes VASTLY superior videos than that one.

The four stars is only because of the mpeg2 format this records to.  I have a mac, so editting requires that I convert to DV with streamclip so that imovie can import the movies.  Mainly, I just don't edit my home videos so that hasn't been a problem.  But if would have been nice for it to be an easier option, and it could have been if they encoded to mpeg4 with h264 and mp3/aac, which appears to be the next standard.  

If that concerns you, or if you want HD, you might wait until the Panasonic SD1 is available because it records in AVHDC which is a form of mpeg4.  Of course, imovie doesn't yet support that either, so you may have to wait until iLife 07 to really use it.  

In parting, I will also mention that the size of this unit is absolutely fabulous.  I no longer dread lugging around even my smallish mini DV camera.  This thing literally fits in my jacket pocket, so I end up filming a lot more than I did with previous cameras.  If you're looking for small, flash-based, and good quality video, get this camera, you'll love it

I was looking specifically for the magic combination of an all-around video and still camera that was compact and built very solid that I can travel with easily.  I have had this camera since Dec 19th, 2006.

I had very bad luck with my previous camera, a Canon Elura that used MiniDVs.  When it worked, the videos were great, but the cassette mechanism kept falling out of adjustment and failing on trips or gatherings, and I lost many unrecoverable moments!  I had an extended warranty and sent it back 3 times, but they were never able to fix it properly. Perhaps this was an unusual lemon, but I did not want to take the chance again! Of the many media types, I've been told the SD cards are the most durable and almost indestructable.  I liked the idea of no moving parts for recording videos.

In addition, I was tired of having a separate digital and video camera, and the technology has finally arrived to combine the two.

For the non-professional camera person looking to catch candid home and travel shots and videos, I've found this is to be a great little camera.  It is amazingly small, and really will fit in a coat pocket. Extremely solid, it is also a snap to use, yet still provides powerful manual override abilities.  The camera turns on within a few seconds.  The video colors are extremely natural and not oversaturated in any way, and the resolution very fine.  The microphone works well, and of course there is no "tape hiss" since there is no tape.  The still photos are of fair quality. I printed some at 8 x 10 and they looked decent: However, if very-high quality photos are what you are after this is NOT the camera for you. Again, this is definitely for the snap-and-shoot-for-memories crowd, not for people who want to win photography awards. The miniscule pop-up flash is amazingly powerful.

I also looked at the Sanyo which has a competing SD model with a higher still photo resolution ability, but it does not have any motion compensation ability. Given how small these cameras are, it is not possible to hand-hold without jiggling it a lot, so I ruled the Sanyo out.

Okay, now the negatives.  There are quite a few, but for what it does I still found this to be the best camera for my purposes:

(1) The camera does not record well in low-light conditions, I'm sure due to the light required for 3CCD color processing and the small size of the lens (cost of being compact!). Filming indoors requires pretty good light to ensure decent videos.  My christmas tree light pictures were disappointing, and my backlit scenes came out looking like shadow-puppet plays.
(2) The cost of buying additional 4GB cards is high, and I am worried about misplacing them because they are so small.
(3) I experienced wide swings in over- and under-exposed still photos using the flash, although I was (usually) able to balance the brightness and contrast with my photo editor.  I'm sure this is partly due to not being used to the camera yet, but the whole idea is not to have to worry about such things.  Flash fill-in on backlit subjects works amazingly well.
(4) The LCD display on the camera is not synchronized to the same level of brightness and contrast as your TV set or your PC, which you will have to adjust upwards during playback. Thankfully, my Sony TV allows custom adjustments for each input source. Ditto when you are creating DVD's...you will need to increase the brightness and contrast to match what you see when playing back a scene through the camera's own LCD viewer.
(5) There is no still photo zoom playback on the camera (at least I have not found it yet). Frequently, I think a snapped photo comes out okay, only to realize when "zooming" the image on the pc to review the details that it is slightly blurry and I need to retake it.
(6) You will need to use the included software to view the MPEG2 videos, as MPEG2 is not an included driver in the editing tools I've reviewed.  
(7) There was no still photo editing software included, only video software. I supposed Panasonic assumes  everyone has their own photo editing software already, but I didn't.  My Canon photo editing software works for these photos, so I am using that.
(8) Finally, the battery fits inside an enclosed compartment, so you are not able to buy an extended battery pack. Since there is no energy required for running a hard drive, DVD burner or tape, admittedly the batteries seem to last longer before recharging, but I still can't see taking a trip with less than 2-3 packs.  I guess I will be spending extra on more batteries!

Even with these drawbacks, there is no doubt that this is an amazing sleek winner with really no competitor in its class that I intend to use heavily at home and on my travels

[Below is my recent review of the JVC Everio GZ-MG40, which has a 20GB hard drive rather than 30GB. Becase GZ-MG50 seems to be identical to GZ-MG40 save the hard drive capacity, I thought this review would be useful to those considering to buy GZ-MG50.]


----------------------------------------

I have been using this camcorder for almost two weeks now. And here are my impressions:

PROS:

A) This is a tiny camcorder and I can easily carry it in my pocket everyday.

B) It records directly on a [30GB] harddrive. This is probably the most amazing feature of this camera. It has the following amazing benefits: 
    (1) A huge recording space 
    (2) Random access to recorded videos when browsing 
       (through a thumblist of videos) 
    (3) Super fast transfer onto your computer through USB 2.0. 
    (4) No tapes, no CDs, no DVDs to worry about while recording video.
    (5) Facilitates easy archiving/organizing . For example, all the recorded files on the camera's harddrive have  "creation date"s as a part of their file information. When the camera is connected to your computer, you can sort all files by date and easily separate all recordings by date to different folders by simply selecting and dragging. (This is extra, but if you want to index and be able to search your video files, say with google desktop, simply enter a list of keywords in the file name about the contents of the file.) 
    (6) The harddrive on your camera can double as additional portable storage media- this is unlikely but If you wanted you could even install linux on it and  carry with you an operating system on your camera.

C) Video quality is good for a consumer level video camera. The sound quality recorded through the internal microphone is good: i can hear the lectures I record very clearly and there is no annoying noise generated by the camera.

D) The charger that comes with this camera is very small. So you can carry that around as well and worry less about running out of battery.


CONS:

A) No mic jacks.
B) manual focus and light adjustments are done through menus.
C) The editing software that comes with it is  limited.
D) The battery life is a mere hour(but you can buy a 3 hour battery for 70-80 dollars).


As with all camcorders, the still images shot with this camera are not at the level of quality you can get from a good still camera. It produces reasonable snapshots in well lit situations.

The video files recorded by this camera have a ".MOD" extension in their name. I replace ".MOD" with  ".MPG" and most of my standard video viewing software automatically recognize the files

Love my new JVC Everio.  The original model just used compact flash cards, but the new Everio GZ uses an ipod like hard drive that lets you store a year's worth of video on it!  Tape is definitely dead, and DVD camcorder's 30 mintues a disc doesn't hold a candle to the Everio.

The only issue I had was that the software that come with it was pretty basic, but all the other video editing software programs didn't recognize the Everio video files (.mod files which contain MPEG2 Video and Dolby Stereo Audio).  

I did finally find Adobe Premiere Elements 2.0 which supports this new file type natively.  It has made editing a breeze.

I've been waiting for this technology for years.  So when I found out JVC was planning on coming out with their 4 GB microdrive version, I had to have one.  The $1500 price tag was too much though.  Then I found out the GZ-MG50 was coming out, and would be about a $1000.  I thought it was still a little pricey, but I couldn't wait any longer.

So far, the camera has performed great.  It's been easy to use and easy to transfer the files to my computer then to DVD.  However, the video editing software that came with it seems a bit cheap, but it gets the job done.  Maybe the next gen version will be an improvement.

The movie quality is very good.  I won't give it a "Great" because I occasionally see pixel blurring when watching my burned DVDs. 

Don't bother taking pictures with this, unless you only plan on emailing them.  The quality is far too low to use to capture those precious moments.

I recommend getting an additional battery (the three hour model).  The one hour battery just doesn't cut it, especially if you want to review your scenes while you're out shooting. 

If JVC gave the camcorder a larger CCD and included better software, I would have given this a 5 star rating, otherwise I think they are on the right track, and in a few years, the MiniDV may be as forgotten as the eight-track.

I went the (thinking it was cheaper) eBay route- for about $10 more  I got a new one here and it WORKS. eBay is nice, but when it comes to stuff like this I learned my lesson. I've never gone wrong ordering from Amazon, in fact I just ordered an OEM NB-3L battery for my SD500; tried the Radio Slop route and it won't go over 20 pictures. Again, shame on me for trying to go cheap

I have looked everywhere for this charger.  Everywhere in town wants me to buy something else that MIGHT work.  It was great to finally find the actual charger that comes with the camera.  It's just the right size and plugs right into the wall.  The prongs fold down and can fit nicely in a carry-on bag.  THANKS so much for having this item available

Good camera for the $129 I paid. Does everything pretty well, and your picture modes are pretty customizable. Only qualm is it takes a second or two longer than I wish when the camera saves/loads pictures to the memory card. Might be a problem when trying to shoot consecutive pictures-- but probably wouldn't be doing it with this type of camera anyways.

I have several different binoculars from small hand held to a large pair of Nikon's I use for wildlife spotting.    I have never had anything that performs nearly as well as these do.  

I am a serious nature and wildlife photographer that has used high end Canon photography equipment for years.   When I saw a Image Stabilized binocular was available with "L" glass, (This is the symbol that Canon uses to identify their finest optics in camera lenses),  I bought them immediately.    

These binoculars are a little bit heavier than a non stabilized pair,  but the weight is easily compensated by the stabilizer.    Once you press the stabilizer button,  the scene will lock, and the effect is amazing.     I tested them by looking at a sign about 100 yards away.   With my normal hand shake I could not read the sign at that distance.    As soon I engaged the stabilizer,  the image locked into place and never once moved.    It performs as well as my camera lenses.  

As far as the optics,  they are, in my opinion second to none in the world.  The image is significantly brighter than any other set I have,  and the calrity and sharpness is incredible.   The night viewing capabilities are incredible. 

Finally, a huge plus is that these binoculars are completely fog and weather sealed.    Change amibient temps, use them in the rain, and the will not allow condensation to get into the unit.  A wonderful feature for those of us that use our equipment in other than nice weather.


Things to be aware of include:

These are relatively large,  which suit a medium to large hand size.   If you have very small hands, your may not like the feel of the unit in your hands. 

Second, the lens caps do not perform well.   They simple do not stay on the unit.     Although for me this is not a serious issue, it is the one area that Canon could have done a much better job.   You can get around this issue by attaching a good uv filter to the lenses.  (You should probably do this anyway to protect the glass)

Finally,  the strap the the carry case comes with is poor.    It is too thin to be comfortably worn for extended use.   I would recommend you find a really comfortable aftermarket camera strap to use with these.   

SUMMARY: 

Outstanding performance and quality.    A little larger fell in your hands than some people may like,  but once you learn to use them, I do not believe any serious birdwatcher or sports fan would ever let them go!    I give the Canon L binoculars a 5 Star rating.

I waited a long time for Canon to come out with image-stabilized binoculars in a 100% waterproof design.  These were worth the wait.  I bought mine specifically for a cruise up Alaska's Inside Passage.  One of our sight-seeing excursions was on a 45-foot boat in heavy seas.  A fellow on this trip had a massive set of Fujinon 16x40 Gyro-Stabilized binoculars that sell for nearly $6,000.  We spent time comparing my Canon binoculars to his Fujinons.  Optically there is NO comparison.  The Canons, while not as superb optically as the best Leica binoculars, are awfully good.  They are far brighter, much sharper, and more accurate in their color rendition than the Fujinons.  The ONLY reason to spend an extra $4,500+ on the Fujinons is if you require the absolute best image stabilization that money can buy.  If you are using binoculars in very severe conditions (high seas, etc.) you will get better performance with the gyro-stabilization in the Fujinons.  In 99% of applications you will get far better results with the Canons.  Though the Fujinons are higher in their rated magnification the only time you'll see a difference is under conditions where motion is severe.  In calmer seas (not calm, just not severe) you will be better off with the Canons; the Fuji's are so much dimmer and lacking in clarity that the Canons make up the magnification difference fairly quickly.

Finally, the waterproof aspect of these binoculars really is worth having.  On the above-mentioned trip we were buffeted by rain and spray from the waves.  The Canons functioned flawlessly without a hitch, and cleaned up nicely afterwards.  These are one of the best products I've ever used, and lived up to their performance claims in every regard.

One point to note: if you want the maximum battery life it is well worth buying lithium AA batteries to use with these binoculars; this will greatly extend your battery life, particularly in cold weather

i just got my new camcorder and start to operate it. first of all is's very easy to operate with the joystick, the use in the still image function is allways available, even while shooting a video (nice feature but as all camcorders - low quality pitures) the stabalizer (one of the reason why i'd preffered that cam over the other) is great and even in full zoom you can get pretty steady videos. the large zoom (X32) is also very nice. overall i think this is great value for my money....

Loved this! It is awesome because it is BOTH land and sea camera, so you need just one! You can get tons of accessories and flashes for it. It is easy to use and the program it comes with allows you to do all kinds of cool corrections INCLUDING making your photos MORE in focus in case you shot them blurry!

I cannot wait to use it again, well UNDERWATER for diving I mean

I bought these for a trip to Costa Rica and used them every day. They are comfortable, easy to focus, and a great choice for the price. These are perfect for folks like me who are interested in casual use for travel, concerts, sports, etc
