I got this when my daughter was 4 months old.  She would sit in it for about 5 minutes, then want to get out.  But now that she is 6 1/2 months, she loves this and stays in it for about 30+ minutes and just entertains herself.  She has great coordination now and she loves to smack and grab the toys, and she coos at the little sun and loves to pull on everything and put it in her mouth.  When we go to family functions or just to someone's house, we always grab the entertainer.  It is very easy to break down and put right back together (if it doesn't fit in the car).  This by far is the best toy that she enjoys and LEARNS from.  She is quite tall for her age, 27 1/4 inches and we still have 2 more height adjustments on this.  This is the best $$$$ we have spent so far

I purchased this toy for my son when he was 4 months old.  At first, he seemed a little intimidated by the toys, and would cry when I put him in it.  Once he got used to it, he really enjoyed it.  

Now he plays with all the toys, and he likes that it wobbles around.  His favorite toy seems to be the sun and the counting beads.  

I did not experience the problem with the feet that others wrote about.  Just lucky I guess.

The seat is really hard to remove for washing, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of

My son loved this!  I purchased this item because I was not comfortable with the idea of hanging something from a door frame.  I was nervous that the one that hangs from a door might somehow come down.  I felt that my baby was very safe in this and I could put it anywhere in the house that I was.  Once he was walking, he didn't use it again

We finally broke down and spent the money on the Jumperoo and were happy we did.  We have to limit the time our son spends in it because he'd jump for hours on end if we didn't limit him to 5-10 minutes a day.  The Jumperoo has sturdy construction, and the 4 settings are useful.  I was a bit concerned about the coils inside the fabric because I was afraid that our son would get his fingers pinched when he held it, but he's been fine.  He doesn't play with the toy attachment.  I think this is a much safer alternative to the jumpers that hang from the door frame

I (and more importantly, my twin boys) really like this jumper.  It seems safer than the doorway jumper, mainly because their fingers won't get mushed.  I like that it has multiple height settings and that it's on a sturdy frame.  They love to jump in it, and before they were able to crawl, it was one of the few ways for them to get out some of that excess energy and get some exercise.  Plus, it's a nice safe place for times when I'd like to get something done without having to keep a constant eye on one of the babies.  

The cons (that wouldn't keep me from buying it again) are: it takes up more room than a doorway jumper, the rattly bear is pretty loud, and the music is obnoxious.  There is an on-off switch and two volume settings for the music, though

I received this Gerber gift set for my baby shower.  The products lather up really well and they smell great!  They are gentle and they don't make my daughter get a rash.  You get a lot of product for the price too.  My daughter really relaxes with the Lavender scent wash and lotion and we used the Menthol wash when she had a cold.  Now that my daughter is teething, she drools a lot which causes chapped skin on her cheeks and chin.  The moisturizing stick works great for this.  We love this gift set and would recommend it.

If you need a shower gift this is it! I got one and I love it...the Gerber products smell sooo good and are gentle enough for everyday bathing! Mt daughter loves to coo at the seal and loves the music cd that comes along with it.
I keep all of the "out grown small bottles in the container and it works great~!
The lotion is good smelling but you can't beat Johnsons and johnstons pink stuff...also include a bottle of that and you will havev a very happy mom-to be!

I picked this monitor after reading many reviews.  The reviews didn't lie.  This monitor does great on distance.  I have a 2400 sq ft home that has 3 floors.  The bedrooms are on the 3rd floor and most of my housework ended up on the 2nd floor.  I can have this on while vacuuming and still hear my son cry or even move around when he would wake up and not make a sound.  I could hear him grunt even!  I don't know why the one review mentions a 15ft signal loss.  You're given many channels in order to find the right strength.  I could go outside of my home and walk approximately 10 ft away from the garage door and still have signal (he was on opposite end of house upstairs).  I also took the receiver in the shower a couple of times, not getting it soaked.  Also like the voice activated portion but that only works if the room or surrounding area has no sound (no radio or tv or mobile playing).  Great product, strongly recommend.  My son is now 5 months old and the monitor still works great.  This monitor is the right choice for the average household.  Interference may come if you're on the same channel. I have wifi network, cordless digital phones and nextels and do not have any interference with this monitor so others just don't know how to resolve thier issue before blaming the product

This is the first baby monitor we've tried and we are quite happy with it.  We did a good bit of research ahead of time and chose this one because of its features and the reliability.  I like that the receiver unit can plug into the wall.  I don't really like to use the voice-activated mode but my husband does and says it works great.  When in the normal mode, I can hear little birds outside my baby's window and cars passing our house; it's quite sensitive!  I also like the lights on the receiver; you can turn the volume all the way down if you're watching a movie or something

In terms of pre-natal resources, this is the best I have found!  The positive results are proven.  I can not think of a reason not to buy this product.  Every expectant parent wants the most and best for their unborn child.  This system is wonderful for interacting with your child before he or she is born.  You will even notice a response from your baby!  It's very exciting

I purchased this item (not from Amazon) and my child loved it! The puppet provides hours of entertainment and the music is great, not the usual 'kid-drivel' that usually is part of any kid item.  Some HBB's come with contemporary music and I will be picking up one of those soon.  Highly recommended

I bought this 2 years ago when I had my first daughter. I used it in her stroller on cool days and could quickly install it on the jogger when going for a run at the beach (where it's usually windy and cooler during the fall). It's very easy to switch from/to any stroller (less than 1 minute). When we visited relatives in Canada at Xmas, I installed the bundleMe on the infant car seat and it kept her warm during our trek from the airport to the parking spot. In San Diego one fall day, when she went down a slide at the park that was still wet, she ended up wearing only a diaper but the BundleMe kept her warm as we walked back home. Never had to worry about losing a blanket on the road, or having enough blankets to keep baby warm, or whether her feet were sticking out of the blankets, lost a shoe/sock, etc.  I am now using the same bundle me with my second child. I'd recommend it to anyone who spends lots of time outdoor taking walks, etc

The matress comes out so you can put it on the floor with the toys overhead. It is very multi-functional

A recent reviewer noted that she had trouble finding information on skin rashes in this book. I had to post a review responding to her review because this book has tons of information on skin and scalp conditions in the table on pages 404-412, which talks about everything from impetigo to eczema. The information on teething is a bit more meager. I agree that this is something that the author needs to expand upon in the next edition of this book. But I still think this is an outstanding baby book. It provides tons of information and is reassuring and contains just the right amount of humor to keep you reading at a time in your life when it's hard to find the time or energy to read.

This has to be the best investment you can make towards your child before they are born, and the results will effect them for their whole life!  It felt like a big commitment for me to have to run the program 2 times a day, and near the end of my pregnancy I was annoyed with having anything strapped across my belly, but I am so glad I pushed through.  My daughter is AMAZING!  I am in awe at her sweet spirit and her advancement.  Baby Plus did everything it promised and more!  Here are some examples:

At birth: eyes wide open, hands open, instant excellent nurser, slept 4-6 hours at night, very calm and happy, cried only when hungry.
At 1 month: smiling all the time at everyone, sleeping 8-10 hrs. at night., recognized mom and dad's faces.
At 2 months: laughing, holding head up
At 3 months: pressing buttons on toys for 6mos +, rolling both directions, holding own bottle
At 4 months: sitting with support
At 5 months: sitting without support, drinking from sippy cup, singing, saying first words
At 6 months: puts self to sleep, pulled self to standing position, creeping... and now almost crawling.

I am completely amazed at her advancements.  People mistake her for being 3-6 months older than she is, and they say she is the happiest baby they have ever known.

I am totally sold on Baby Plus

I purchased the earlier version of this product two years ago.  I was disappointed that I wasn't able to use it for my second pregnancy, most likely because it had been dropped too many times.  This new version comes with a cloth pouch that makes it MUCH MORE user friendly.  Also, one set of batteries (4 AA) lasted for 4-1/2 weeks.  The batteries in my old one would last 5 days IF I was lucky.  My daughter just turned two in January 06 and is extremely smart, verbally advanced and a joy to be around.  By 16 months she knew all of her colors and could recite the ABC's.  By 18 months she could recognize all of the letters.  I believe we are well on our way to having a reading child by the age of 3.  Do I credit the Baby Plus?  Who really knows but we decided not to chance it and are using it again for baby #2.

A friend of mine introduced me to the BabyPlus system.  I am just now beginning my third trimester and have been using the BabyPlus since week 20.  I enjoy the 2 hours a day I use the system.  I feel like I am 'doing a good thing' for my little boy on the way.  While using BabyPlus, the battery cover clips snapped off.  I emailed customer service and they happily offered to replace the cover, no questions asked.  BabyPlus is a company that seems more concerned with a positive experience for the baby, rather than making sure I had all the required paperwork for replacement parts

I am using the babyplus system for the second time and  am looking forward to the same benefits as it produced with my 5 year old.
Faith was born alert, calm, and hardly cried at all as an infant. She slept through the night right away with only waking to eat.
She is now in her last year of preschool and she enjoys to write, sing and listen to music and loves arts and crafts. Her teachers tell us how she is constantly helping other students in class with writing letters and words when they have had trouble.
Her disposition has always been happy and eager to learn. She has great coordination  with activities and sports.
I am a nurse and I tell all my patients and friends about the BabyPlus system.
I am pregnant with my second child and there was no question at all that I would use the BabyPlus system again.
Do not be afraid to try something new. Just read the studies and reviews, they speak for themselves.
You will not be sorry that you purchased this product for your unborn child.

I bought this swing because our first baby had colic & reflux and I heard someone else say that the side-to-side swinging action really calmed their babies colic.  I thought this baby might be too so we bought this swing.  No colic this time, but she already loves to watch the birds and butterflies turn around the top.  She follows them around with her eyes.  Very stimulating for the young ones

I love this swing - my fussy first child could not live without it.  I had my second child two years later and the swing is now really loud. I called Fisher Price and they said that the motor will wear out with use.  So now mine sounds like a metronome - it clicks back and forth.  If I had to do it all over again - I would still buy this swing b/c of the design.  I just wish that FP would build a motor that was more durable and better yet - that plugs into the wall

Our 21-month old daughter has been using this tub since birth and we love it!  It does hold water and she can splash around and play with her toys.  The sunctions are great since they do stick pretty good to the tub.  Easy to clean and easy to put away when my husband or I need to use our regular tub

I purchased this to put on the changing table.  I was looking for something that would fit on top of the table next to the changing mat and would hold diapers, wipes, lotions,etc.  I purchased and returned two other baskets for various reasons then I found this one.  It fits perfectly and holds the wipes container, several diapers, lotion, hair brush, etc.  I love that it has separate pockets to hold small items so that they dont fall over.  This allows everything to be within easy reach while changing the baby.  The price was also reasonable.  I was looking at buying one from Pottery Barn for twice the amount.  This basket is a great buy

We originally registered for this item because we have a 2-level house, and thought this would help us from trudging up and down the stairs so much.  But, since my 2-month old still "lives" in our room, in her bassinet, that part has not yet been an issue.  However, we keep this basket in our living room, fully stocked, and we don't even have to get up off the couch to change a diaper.  (Sounds lazy, but if you already have kids, you understand!)  The sides of the liner have pockets, which we use to hold hand sanitizer, diaper rash cream, a thermometer, baby brush, aspirator, baby nail clippers, lotion, a couple rattles/toys, and some chapstick and nursing pads for me.  We put the diapers, a changing pad, and a wipe holder in the "main" center part.  I also have two wrist rattles attached to either side of the handle, and my baby loves to look at them while she's getting her diaper changed.  (I put the basket next to her head so she can see one of them.)

The basket itself is well made, and I have no fears of it falling apart any time soon.  (In fact, we plan to put it to other use once baby is out of diapers!)  We have not yet had to wash the liner, but it appears to be well made, and I have no fears of it falling apart, although I am going to throw it in a laundry bag and use the delicate cycle

When my third child was born, we got this tub.  It has been the best yet for us.  From infant stage to now 6 months old, my daughter has fit snugly.  As an infant, the sling is perfect because you can't immerse the baby while the stump is still attached.  We used the tub on the counter by the bathroom sink, which worked very well while she was in the hammock stage.  Once her stump fell off, and she was able to control her head well, we lowered the bottom half of the hammock into the tub and let baby's bottom rest in the nook that is created between the hump and the top part of the tub.  A perfect angle for baby to rest comfortably while getting a bath.  This is the position in which we currently use our tub.  Now, however, we bathe her in the Aquarium tub instide the bathtub so we don't have to worry about where the water lands.  Finally, once baby is old enough to sit without support, we'll remove the sling altogether and let her sit in the wide end of the tub to play during bath time.  No doubt our daughter will enjoy this final transition in the short weeks ahead

My mother-in-law bought these for my daughter.  At first, I was skeptical about how entertaining they would be, but my daughter took to them right away.  In the beginning, she would just chew on them and smile at the quacking duck noise, but now she interacts more and seems to love feeling all the different textures.  She also loves to knock them down when I stack them up.

They won't entertain her for hours, but she's always thrilled to see them when I break them out for the first time that day

Our son got these blocks when he was 2 months old.  My husband enjoyed them more at first, but by the time our son was 5 months old he loved playing with these!  He probably couldn't hold on to them well until he was 5 months old, so that is why he enjoyed them more at this age than earlier.

At 10 months, he still enjoys playing with them.  They have lasted through "both" children.  I would highly recommend these blocks for infants, and so far even into the toddler age, he enjoys playing with them

My 6 month old got these for Christmas.  They were among the first toys she expressed any interest in.  She loved the frog that vibrated when you pull the leg, but it broke.  I emailed Baby Einstein and asked if I could buy a replacement for the green block because it is her all time favorite.  They are sending a free replacement!  We love Baby Einstein and our daughter loves these blocks

I got this when my daughter was 4 months old.  She would sit in it for about 5 minutes, then want to get out.  But now that she is 6 1/2 months, she loves this and stays in it for about 30+ minutes and just entertains herself.  She has great coordination now and she loves to smack and grab the toys, and she coos at the little sun and loves to pull on everything and put it in her mouth.  When we go to family functions or just to someone's house, we always grab the entertainer.  It is very easy to break down and put right back together (if it doesn't fit in the car).  This by far is the best toy that she enjoys and LEARNS from.  She is quite tall for her age, 27 1/4 inches and we still have 2 more height adjustments on this.  This is the best $$$$ we have spent so far

It was a poop-eroo for us too.
</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
We waited until our daughter was [...] to get her this, and it's fantastic!  She's now [...] and it's in storage, but she was using it until she was about [...]  I like that the height is adjustable, the springs are covered, and the seat comes out easily to wash it.  (It was a poop-eroo for us too.)

A few things that I learned using this though is:
The blue spinning toy doesn't come out and yucky stuff can collect underneath it.  It is incredibly hard to clean.
The one that I got was a pain in the tush to get the batteries in, so once the batteries died, we set the kangaroo part aside.
My daughter's feet got rubbed raw when we first got this because she loved jumping in it.  I recommend using a pair of Robeez, or at very least a pair of socks, to protect their feet

My son loved this!  I purchased this item because I was not comfortable with the idea of hanging something from a door frame.  I was nervous that the one that hangs from a door might somehow come down.  I felt that my baby was very safe in this and I could put it anywhere in the house that I was.  Once he was walking, he didn't use it again

We finally broke down and spent the money on the Jumperoo and were happy we did.  We have to limit the time our son spends in it because he'd jump for hours on end if we didn't limit him to 5-10 minutes a day.  The Jumperoo has sturdy construction, and the 4 settings are useful.  I was a bit concerned about the coils inside the fabric because I was afraid that our son would get his fingers pinched when he held it, but he's been fine.  He doesn't play with the toy attachment.  I think this is a much safer alternative to the jumpers that hang from the door frame

If you need a shower gift this is it! I got one and I love it...the Gerber products smell sooo good and are gentle enough for everyday bathing! Mt daughter loves to coo at the seal and loves the music cd that comes along with it.
I keep all of the "out grown small bottles in the container and it works great~!
The lotion is good smelling but you can't beat Johnsons and johnstons pink stuff...also include a bottle of that and you will havev a very happy mom-to be!

I registered for this kit and got two - at first I considered taking one back, but I am glad I didn't.  It is great to have way more of these necessities to start off with, that's months of not having to remember to buy any!

I love the bucket-thing this comes in - one currently holds all our bath stuff for easy toting to the bathroom.  The other one is our bib-holder, since we have a TON of bibs. It keeps them neat, all in one place and closes and can be put away for guests.  

The vapor bath is fantastic.  We just got over my son's first cold and it worked like a charm. He loves baths to begin with and this filled the whole bathroom with that soothing vapor and within minutes I could hear the difference in his breathing! When I caught the cold a few days later, I have to admit, I also took a vapor bath and it was better than a hot shower for clearing my congestion!

I don't know that the Lavendar one necessarily calms or soothes the baby, but it smells nice.  We've gotten shampoo in his eye at least once with no tears or fuss, so it must not burn. 

I definitely recommend getting this for new moms-to-be

THIS MONITOR HAS THE BEST SOUND QUALITY YOU CAN PUT THE RADIO ON THE MONITOR AND LISTEN ON THE RECEVER, IT WILL SOUND LIKE THE RADIO IS NEXT TO YOU. I HAD THE MONITOR FOR 2 YEAR WITH OUT PROBLEMS WITH RANGE OR INTERFERANCE. MY MONITOR IS BEEN ON AND IN THE SAME CHANNEL ALL THAT TIME. I TRY THREE OTHER MONITORS ONE OF THEM DIGITAL. THE SONY SOUND QUALITY IS UNTOUCHABLE. VERY SENSITIVE, I CAN HEAR MY BABY MOVE AT NIGHT. I HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH RANGE (I WORK OUT ON THE BASEMENT DURING HER NAP). IT HAS THE BEST VOLUME (I CAN HEAR HER OVER A LOUD TREADMILL AND MUSIC). I WAS HAPPY TO RETURN THE OTHER MONITORS TO GET THIS ONE. THE ONE PROBLEN I FOUND IS THE MONITOR AND THE RECEVER CAN NOT BE CLOSE TO EACH OTHER BECAUSE IT WILL MAKE A HORRIBLE LOUD NOISE. TO AVOID THIS I TURN OFF THE MONITOR BEFORE GETTING CLOSE TO THE ROOM THE BABY IS SLEEPING IN. THE WATER RESISTANT FEATURE IS GREAT, I CAN PUT THE RECEVER RIGHT IN THE SHOWER AND LISTEN OR WATCH THE LIGHTS. IT IS NOT WATERPROOF!!!!!!!! YOU DON'T WANT TO GET IT WET!!!!!!, BUT THE HUMIDITY OR A LITTLE SPLASHING WON'T HURT IT

I picked this monitor after reading many reviews.  The reviews didn't lie.  This monitor does great on distance.  I have a 2400 sq ft home that has 3 floors.  The bedrooms are on the 3rd floor and most of my housework ended up on the 2nd floor.  I can have this on while vacuuming and still hear my son cry or even move around when he would wake up and not make a sound.  I could hear him grunt even!  I don't know why the one review mentions a 15ft signal loss.  You're given many channels in order to find the right strength.  I could go outside of my home and walk approximately 10 ft away from the garage door and still have signal (he was on opposite end of house upstairs).  I also took the receiver in the shower a couple of times, not getting it soaked.  Also like the voice activated portion but that only works if the room or surrounding area has no sound (no radio or tv or mobile playing).  Great product, strongly recommend.  My son is now 5 months old and the monitor still works great.  This monitor is the right choice for the average household.  Interference may come if you're on the same channel. I have wifi network, cordless digital phones and nextels and do not have any interference with this monitor so others just don't know how to resolve thier issue before blaming the product

I've been very pleased with the performance of this monitor.  We have a two story house with wifi and cordless phones and have never had a problem with interference. I've use the monitor in every room in the house and had no problems with reception.  I think this is a really high quality monitor and would definitely recommend it

My husband and I adore this monitor.  It picks up on every little noise our little one makes which is great.  We occasionally get some interference, but all I have to do is move the monitor and it goes away.  The interference never occurs on the unit in my baby's room, just on the parent unit so you do not have to worry about waking the little one up.  I love the rechargeable battery option and the ability to carry around the unit with me throughout our 2 story house.  I plug it in at night by my bed and it then runs all day long!  You can defintely trust this monitor

We live in the cold, rainy Northwest part of the country.  This product has been essential since our little boy was born in December. It has been in his carseat since the day we took him home from the hospital.  We never need to use blankets or bundle him up in heavy clothes when we take him out in the carseat.  He stays warm and protected in the Bundle Me.  This is definitely the best and most used product we have bought for our baby.  It is a must for Winter babies.  It is well worth the money

Wow!  This is the best thing I received for my baby.  It has saved me sooo much time.  I would normally have to layer my daughter before heading out the door but I just don't need to worry with this.  I feel sorry for all the people who bought my daughter thick sweaters, and the aunt who bought her a snow suit.  We just never use them.  I can zip her into the Bundle Me and head out for a walk in the stroller.  She usually falls asleep because she finds it so cozy.  When she was smaller, we used it in the infant car seat which fit into our stroller.  It meant she was zipped in before we opened the door and unzipped when we reached our destination.  She never felt the cold!

It is really easy to use and fits on our two different strollers and car seats.

This is a great pack'n'play.  It's easy to set-up and take any place.  The bassinet is great - very sturdy and larger than another one that I have.  The colors are bright and the music piece keeps our baby's attention.  My only problem is the piece for the top.  Whenever I try to use it, the arms bow in and it doesn't look very sturdy.  I also have trouble using this piece and the mat on the ground.  It just doesn't seem very sturdy and I have tried everything.

Other than that, I am glad that I bought this!

My little girl loves this play space! The colors and over head bar keep her amused for long enough that I can get dinner on or help with home work. The only thing that might make it better would be if the music in the push button play mat lasted longer than 2 minutes.

I think for your money you get a great value for this playard.  It comes with an interactive musical toy that no other playard comes with anything like this.  It also comes with overhead bars that you can hang toys from and the baby can play with.  The mattress seems very comfortable and I bought this playpen because the bassinet part looked more reinforced than the others.  It has bars that snap in place and also has plastic parts that hang over the tops.  The mat can also be used as a playmat on the floor with the overhead bars

Our daughter is turning 2 years old this week and I felt it time to finally write a review of this amazing product.  From the very beginning, she has been an incredibly alert and interested baby.  She was born c-section at 38 weeks with eyes and hands wide open.  Once they were finished cleaning her up, my husband and I were thrilled to just cuddle her and talk to her while she looked at us both with wide eyes and made little coo coo sounds.  Right away she was great at nursing with a very good latch.  She rarely ever cried, and when she did, it was a quiet little "lay lay lay" sound, not the wild Waa-waa's.  

Throughout infancy she was always capable of adapting to every situation quickly and without emotional outburst.  Where it would seem other children would be over-stimulated in an environment, she would thrive and seem to want more stimulation!  At only three months of age, people thought she was older because of her alertness and interest in people and animals.  She hit every developmental milestone months early, especially in language (sign and speech), music appreciation, and colors/shape/letter/number recognition.  Her pediatrician has been happily surprised by her and suggested that I should have five more just like her! 

When we bought the BabyPlus, we thought, "if it helps only 10% as well as the testimonials say it does, it will be worth it".  We're certain it has contributed positively in helping develop this little miracle of ours.  We're now expecting child #2 (25 weeks along) and although not using the Baby Plus could be an interesting experiment (same gene pool, same parenting, etc.), we're too interested in the possibilities of how much it may contribute to our next child for us to withhold it.

ok so how many people think their baby is exceptional? Well, pretty much everyone i know, and they are all right of course.  Each baby is exceptional, in their own way.  But how many babies are rated as exceptional by pediatricians, nurses and early childhood educators?  Well, I know one - MINE!  I faithfully used the babyplus system when I was pregnant.  One time when using it, he started knocking back. Yeap, i actually felt him knock back at it, in rhythm.  It only happened once, but I told my husband that i think this is going to be one special kid.  I was about 7 months pregnant then.  Well, lo and behold, after he was born people (professionals) don't stop telling us how amazing he is.  He is the most aware newborn you will ever meet.  He is 2 months old now, and has been sleeping through the night (11 hours at a time) since he was 2 weeks.  He cries when he needs something, and never cries for no reason (but i do make sure to respond quickly to his needs so i don't know how much that has to do with it.).  Yesterday he started reaching for objects.  Can't quite grab them yet, but it doesn't stop him from trying. The pediatrician and the nurse remarked how incredibly physically strong he is, how aware he seems and the fact that he vocalizes to music is unheard of at this age.  He's been holding his head up since the day he was born (3 days late) and has been making eye contact since about 2 weeks.  So, i don't really know what if anything the baby plus system had to do with it.  I mean it could be just an accident but... all I can say is that I will definitely use this product with our future children.  I would pay thousands if i had to (and we are not rich people) because its worth every penny

The strap on mine broke and I was very quickly sent a replacement.  I expressed my concerns about the size of the belt( I have a small frame and it is big on me) and I was told a newer design was in the works and they would send it to me once it's done.  Very friendly, amazing customer service, that's hard to find these days!

This has to be the best investment you can make towards your child before they are born, and the results will effect them for their whole life!  It felt like a big commitment for me to have to run the program 2 times a day, and near the end of my pregnancy I was annoyed with having anything strapped across my belly, but I am so glad I pushed through.  My daughter is AMAZING!  I am in awe at her sweet spirit and her advancement.  Baby Plus did everything it promised and more!  Here are some examples:

At birth: eyes wide open, hands open, instant excellent nurser, slept 4-6 hours at night, very calm and happy, cried only when hungry.
At 1 month: smiling all the time at everyone, sleeping 8-10 hrs. at night., recognized mom and dad's faces.
At 2 months: laughing, holding head up
At 3 months: pressing buttons on toys for 6mos +, rolling both directions, holding own bottle
At 4 months: sitting with support
At 5 months: sitting without support, drinking from sippy cup, singing, saying first words
At 6 months: puts self to sleep, pulled self to standing position, creeping... and now almost crawling.

I am completely amazed at her advancements.  People mistake her for being 3-6 months older than she is, and they say she is the happiest baby they have ever known.

I am totally sold on Baby Plus

I bought this swing because our first baby had colic & reflux and I heard someone else say that the side-to-side swinging action really calmed their babies colic.  I thought this baby might be too so we bought this swing.  No colic this time, but she already loves to watch the birds and butterflies turn around the top.  She follows them around with her eyes.  Very stimulating for the young ones

I love this swing - my fussy first child could not live without it.  I had my second child two years later and the swing is now really loud. I called Fisher Price and they said that the motor will wear out with use.  So now mine sounds like a metronome - it clicks back and forth.  If I had to do it all over again - I would still buy this swing b/c of the design.  I just wish that FP would build a motor that was more durable and better yet - that plugs into the wall

We originally registered for this item because we have a 2-level house, and thought this would help us from trudging up and down the stairs so much.  But, since my 2-month old still "lives" in our room, in her bassinet, that part has not yet been an issue.  However, we keep this basket in our living room, fully stocked, and we don't even have to get up off the couch to change a diaper.  (Sounds lazy, but if you already have kids, you understand!)  The sides of the liner have pockets, which we use to hold hand sanitizer, diaper rash cream, a thermometer, baby brush, aspirator, baby nail clippers, lotion, a couple rattles/toys, and some chapstick and nursing pads for me.  We put the diapers, a changing pad, and a wipe holder in the "main" center part.  I also have two wrist rattles attached to either side of the handle, and my baby loves to look at them while she's getting her diaper changed.  (I put the basket next to her head so she can see one of them.)

The basket itself is well made, and I have no fears of it falling apart any time soon.  (In fact, we plan to put it to other use once baby is out of diapers!)  We have not yet had to wash the liner, but it appears to be well made, and I have no fears of it falling apart, although I am going to throw it in a laundry bag and use the delicate cycle

I got this for my baby girl and both she and I love it!!!  She doesn't slip and it is really comfortable for her.  She really enjoys bathtime.  And, if you follow the way the hammock should be used for the size of your baby...  you will really enjoy it.  I wanted this prior to my baby being born, but I read some of the reviews and I didn't buy it for her.  After the first month of her using another tub, and having trouble with the product, I decided to buy this Aquarium tub that I wanted in the first place.  Caution:  Please use the hammock as directed for your baby's size.  This tub is perfect if you do that!  The reviews that I read about the hammock being too small or the bump in the middle of the tub were laughable when I actually read the directions before use.  Please read the directions.  Both you and your child will appreciate that you did

Our son got these blocks when he was 2 months old.  My husband enjoyed them more at first, but by the time our son was 5 months old he loved playing with these!  He probably couldn't hold on to them well until he was 5 months old, so that is why he enjoyed them more at this age than earlier.

At 10 months, he still enjoys playing with them.  They have lasted through "both" children.  I would highly recommend these blocks for infants, and so far even into the toddler age, he enjoys playing with them

My 6 month old got these for Christmas.  They were among the first toys she expressed any interest in.  She loved the frog that vibrated when you pull the leg, but it broke.  I emailed Baby Einstein and asked if I could buy a replacement for the green block because it is her all time favorite.  They are sending a free replacement!  We love Baby Einstein and our daughter loves these blocks

These blocks contain everything you could want in a toy.  Each has different textures, images, and something unique about it.
-The yellow block has a duck on the one side that "quacks" when pressed.  On the other side is a sun whose face flips up to reveal a tiny mirror.  Another side has a picture of some bananas with a clear plastic over them to make for an interesting texture and yet another side contains a circle motif.
-The red block rattles, has a picture of a robin (?) on the one side, a square pattern motif on another side, and a picture of strawberries on another.
-The green block has a frog with 3D legs and the one leg is a pull toy that will cause the block to shake.  It also has a picture of a green apple (mine does, at least, although this picture shows a leaf), a silky fabric with leaf prints, and a triangle motif.
-The blue block is another rattle.  It has a picture of the BE turtle on one side, some jeans made from real denim on another, and a star motif on another.
-All blocks have a side with the color's name (I bought mine at Target, and they have the name in english, spanish, and french although these pictured only show it in English).  The rest of the sides are filled with textured fabrics such as a soft, fluffly fur or a bumpy texture (like the material found on the bottom of some slippers to prevent skidding).
My three month old loves to look at these blocks and I rub the different sides against her skin while saying "soft", "smooth", or "bumpy" and she loves the feelings.  My friend's daughter, who is five months, loves to pick up and throw down the blocks.  It's one of her favorite games.  I'd reccomend these blocks as a must have for any infant

I have recently had my FIFTH child and so I have experienced many baby items, including swings, and this one is the BEST!  It has a cushiony, comfy seat for baby with different recline options; soothing lights and mobile for baby to have something to look at; several musical tunes with adjustable volume control.  There is also a dial to set the swing motion -- to go slowly or faster -- and the best feature of all is that this cradle swing can be changed to swing side to side, or front to back.  Sometimes we put our baby in swinging front to back, and she'll cry -- we then change the swing position to go side to side, and she immediately stops crying and starts to fall asleep.  And vice versa, sometimes we put her in side to side, and she wants to swing front to back -- how great to have that option so she can swing whatever way she's in the mood for!  As my husband says, "this is the best money we've ever spent!

I received this stroller today and was pleasantly surprised. I put it together, all you have to do is attach the wheels and the canopy which took all of 5 mins, and my 3yr old jumped on the back seat and loves it.  I have the Chicco Key-Fit infant car seat and it fits just fine with the infant carrier bar in place, my baby slept in the car seat in the stroller all afternoon.  There is a nice seatbelt that goes over the infant car seat to hold it firmly in the stroller.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it's a bit heavy/bulky, I hope I don't have any problems getting it in and out of my van.  I can't wait to try it out at the mall

The first time I used this excersaucer I was at my sister-in-laws house and she advised to put my six month old in it. At first I was hesitant because I thought it looked too high and kind of unsturdy, compared to my excersaucer deluxe and my excersaucer 3in1. I did end up putting Daireeann in it and she loved it so much that I bought one two days later to take to my after baptism party at a restaurant where I might add was so compact that she did not get bumped into at all.  The only thing is mine did not come with a musical pad at the bottom.  Just a little tip, if you bend the bar back a little bit it will not bump the babies head and the mirror can be flipped facing a way from the baby. I do recommend this one and trust me I am very picky when it comes to my kids so this is a good choice

We had a very fussy baby, and we used these, and blankets and just about anything to keep him propped up or positioned. I was forever reaching for these because of their reliable size and shape. I considered it money well spent and carefully packed it away with my newborn clothing so I could use it over with child number two

This item is invaluable in preventing Plagiocephaly (flattening of the head)...I wish we had known about it for our twins.  Newborns especially need a very soft surface for their very soft and malleable skulls.  We used it for our third baby and as a result, he has a perfectly round head and proportioned features.  The incline greatly reduced spit up as the 'flap' between their esophagus and stomach is not developed yet.  Gravity prevents the milk/formula from traveling back up and causing gas and or spit up.  I've noticed the biggest complaint about this item is that infants seem to slip down in it during the night.  This is true, however, rolling up a receiving blanket real tight and placing it in a "U" shape under our son's bottom prevented this from happening ever again.  As a result, he slept soundly, never spit up once, never woke us up with gas pain and has a perfectly round head.  I strongly recommend the Boppy Noggin Nest as well to keep the pressure off the head when your baby is not in his crib.  Also, if your baby is old enough to roll over, this item is not for you.  One other note: the foam wedges on either side do trap some body heat, so don't over-swaddle or put too many layers on...adjust the thickness of your blanket to the ambient temperature.  I would say this is a good item for newborns to about 5 months. It made an enourmous difference in the well being of our third child compared to his older twin siblings

This monitor is pretty good.  It pick up my little one's little noises so I can get to her before she awakens.  It does have a clicking sound with it if the reception in less then 4 bars (which it is less then 4 bars most of the time as my house is long).  I do have high praise for the Fisher Price exchange service.  I had bought a monitor before my little one was born and so therefor didn't use it until after the 30 day return allowance from Amazon was up.  Then after about 6 hours of use the monitor stopped working.  I was able to send it to Fisher-Price and they exchanged it in less then ten days! (no questions asked

I just bought this one for the top of the stairs and a pressure mounted gate for the bottom of the stairs.  My first impressions is that a pressure mounted gate is fine for the bottom of stairs.  However, gates which attach to walls with screws are way more sturdy than even the best pressure mounted alternative.  

We considered this model and the Evenflo "Top of Stair Gate".  After inspecting both gates in the store we opted for this one because the wood spindles on the Evenflo seemeed less sturdy and potentially prone to breaking.  If one of the spindles breaks you have to replace the entire unit.  Also, why take the chance with safety?  
 
Anyway, here are a few things to consider when installing this item: 
1. I took the advice of others and only used the template for the swing side hardware only.  This is a must do.  It would be a wall-damaging crapshoot to try to get both sides lined up exactly right using templates on both sides of the wall.  
2. Unless you are screwing the hardward into a banister and don't want to damage them by having screws go all the way through, use longer screws than the dinky 1/4" to 1/2" screws that are provided in the kit.  I went with 2" screws for additional strength.  
3) Installation isn't that big of a deal.  Just take your time to avoid silly mistakes that result in extra holes in your walls.  I found the picture-based instructions at the back of the booklet far more useful than the word-based instructions at the front of the booklet.  It wasn't a five minute job but it was not hard at all.  

I'll be back in a few months to post my thoughts on the gate after it has had some wear and tear from our 11 months old son and our 100lb dog.

I love this bra!  It is very comfortable, I hardly notice I have it on.  The soft stretchy material is perfect.  The closure hooks are easy to use once you use them a few times and get familiar with how to open and close them.  I am glad I bought this nursing bra and I highly recommend it

This nursing bra is extremely comfortable, ONCE you get it on. It is difficult to get over the chest and back. You practically need 5 hands because it tends to roll under as you're pulling it down your back. I've been wearing it during my pregnancy, I can't imagine how much more difficult it may be to put on when my breasts have grown after the delivery. 

I give it 4 stars though for it's comfort. Once it's on you hardly know you're wearing a bra, and the snaps have been easy to undo and resnap with one hand. Because they are plastic snaps though, I'm wondering how long they will last with 7-8 feedings a day. I will write more on this once the baby arrives (5 more weeks!)

I love this bra! I have 2, so that one is always in the wash.  It is the most comfrotable thing I have ever put on.  I bought it a week after my son was born and my milk came in. It was so much more comfortable then my other nursing bra.  I felt so much better after I put it on for the first time.  I felt like I could breathe again

I bought several different kinds of nursing bras before my baby was born including this one.  This is the only one I still wear.  Traditional nursing bras are uncomfortable and obvious under clothes.  I bought larger sizes of my favorite bra and wear those when I go out.  I sleep in the Medela bra and wear it around the house.  I am quite large breasted, and I find they have plenty of support.  I even do low-impact aerobics in it.  It is worth every penny

My Mom always said that the Rectal thermometer was the best but when she used the speed one on me I found out my temperature right away and that was so cool and I like how it even does it quicker rectally than orally so I dont mind a rectal temp now and you know what? My brothers are even doing it that way and one of them is 16 yrs old.

We registered for this product since it includes so many items necessary for a baby. Upon receiving it as a shower gift, I knew this was going to be great. I love the convenient pouch that all the tools and accessories come in. It's small enough to carry around in a diaper bag. This is a must have for every new parent

I had wished that I had bought this potty chair from the very begining.  I bought my son the royal potty throne from fisher price it ended up leaking.  I never could find the place that is was leaking.  So I purchased Babybjorn Green potty chair.  My son loved it the moment that I took it out of the box.  He wanted to use it in the family room.  I love it because it is only 2 pieces.  It's so super easy to clean. And it is green my sons favorite color.  Great price and great size.  I recommend this item

we got an inexpensive potty first and it was not comfortable for our baby to sit on. he wouldn't use that potty, but he went on the bjorn the first time he sat on it. the bjorn is shaped perfectly, with a comfy back support and an oval shaped bowl so there is enough space for a boy to sit and pee. it's so comfy that he will sit and read a book! looks great too. simple and easy to clean

I purchased this carrier when my son was just a week old and used it for nearly one year.  It was on clearance at Babies R Us for only fifteen dollars.  It was well worth the price.  The only problem I ever encountered with it was the back support was minimal.  I do have frequent back problems and it does not take much to aggravate it.  The weight of my son did get a little daunting at about the six month mark.  

My brother would also use the carrier and he claims the support was fine for him.  I would say if you have back problems think hard about this purchase, if you don't go ahead.  I personally would still make this purchase.  Another plus is that is does not look as silly as those women carrying around their child in a Sling.  People never gave me those looks with this!

This was a great addition to the Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem--I can pretty much empty the essentials out of my purse, have everything discreetly on hand, and not have to lug around yet another bag. Organizer is easy to slip onto the handle and doesn't shift around at all. Have found this product to be really helpful

I do like this organizer, since the stroller I have doesn't have any holders on itself (for the "pusher").   There is a nice zippered area for keys to go into and stay secure and one drink holder.   I don't have any problem with this organizer at all but I put it at 4 stars because I would like to say that the majority of time that I'm out using the stroller, I'm with another adult who could also use a drink holder.  We're used to the Graco-designed strollers that DO come with 2 drink holders.  It's not the end of the world that someone holds their drink...but it would be nice if they could include another pocket for a drink.  :-

The wedge, along with a vaporizer, helps my three-month-old sleep better at night. sometimes she slides down, but she used to slide around before the wedge, too. Most nights she stays on the wedge just as I positioned her and i think it helps with winter's stuffy noses. It's easy to use and not that expensive.

I liked this positioner because it came with an adjustable head piece. My baby kept wiggling up to the top of the headboard and this piece kept him from doing so.  I also liked the fact that as my baby grew wider I could adjust the wedges.  One more thing this comes with a mat.  This saved me from changing the sheet because he puked up so much.  I bought two and would flipp flopp them when he would get sick

This is a great toy for my baby to play with in his high chair while he's waiting for breakfast. There are lots of things to shake, spin and rattle. The suction actually works and they stay on his tray unless he pulls really hard. Also,it's very durable because he's dropped it about a hundred times on a tile floor and it hasn't broken yet! At first I wasn't crazy about the fact that the 'cow over the moon' toy doesn't play but one verse at a time with each press of the button because he was only hearing the first verse but in no time at all my baby learned that if he wanted to hear the rest of the song he needed to push the button. Now he does it on his own and hears the whole song. I think that's great. I would recommend this set to anyone.

I found one of these at a yard sale ... and it didn't have the suction cup portion.  So, I have no idea if it's a good high chair toy.

However, the toy part gets 5 stars from my daughter!  She has been fascinated by this toy since she was 3 months old.  Now, she is 5 months, and she chooses this toy over all others.  It is her favorite to chew on, bang around, grab, and study.

The black and white handle (that goes into the suction cup) is very easy for her to hold.  She can grasp it with both hands and bring it to her mouth. The mirror/smiley face ball is fun to watch.  The rattle and noises it makes are fun, but not annoying

I used one of these 24 inch extensions to cover a 90 inch space.  The Kidco configure gate contains three 24 inch pieces (i.e. 72 inches total), so if you need extra length, you can purchase 8 or 24 inch extensions to customize your gate to any length.  The extension was easy to use and is very sturdy.  The gate looks uniformed and you cannot tell it is several separate pieces.  The only 'issue' is you have to connect the extensions to either the section w/the door (i.e. 24 inch section with the open/close swing door) or use it as an end piece.  I was not able to continously connect extensions to one another (not sure if I did this incorrectly or not.)  But nonetheless, the extension worked fine and I love my new gate

Bought this gate to keep a small dog in a room.  The entry area is not symmetrical and the gate was configurable to fit perfectly.  Works well, looks good and feels solid.  Highly recommend for this use

We bought two different kinds of Gates for our living room area.  We bought the Kidco Configure gate and the Kidco Elongate. 
     The elongate was to cover an area of 84".  The elongate can only go straight across and opening.  It's extension are screwed together and have an overlap. So the gate is not actually straight across.  We are very disappointed in this purchase and wished we had bought two Configure gates.  Took us some time to screw the extension in and then to screw the supports in and then to mark it on the wall.  Took us over an hour.
     The Configure gate is on the pricey side.  We almost did not buy it.  But it has two different size extension pieces and you can bend and configure it to the space you need.  We use it at the bottom of our stairs and it bows out to give you an area so that the gate is not up against the stairs.
     It was so easy to add the extension piece on.  You just snap out the pole and add the extension piece.  You can bend the gate different ways to fit in the opening.
     To Mount on the wall you just mark the screw holes and screw in the plate then snap the gate on.  It was mounted on the wall in less then 20 minutes.  It was very sturdy.
     I highly recommend this gate.

There is NO way my daughter will be able to get through this gate. She is the most rambunctious little girl too. And she is only 10 months old. She is already running around and able to walk really well on her own. And she loves the stairs. This gate is perfect in front of our stairs and they're not even with the wall either. The banaster and the very top stair are totally uneven and our opening is about 7 feet wide. And with the Configure Gate and one extension, there is no way I will ever have to worry about my daughter falling down the staris or breaking our gates, which she has done due to the way the top of our stairs are. This is the only gate that I have found that works perfect for our home. Plus the door in the gate is easy to use. You don't have to squeeze hard on the handle to open it, but it's not easy enough for a 4 year old to squeeze the handle. I love that this is a heavy-duty metal gate, it won't break or fall apart on me and it was easy to install. I'm so happy that my husband and I bought this gate. It is an all around Great Investment. If you are considering buying a baby gate, you should really invest in a great baby gate. And I HIGHLY recommend this gate. And with the extensions it can fit ANYWHERE in your home or you can make it into a circle for a play yard. If you want a gate for your home, and you want one that will last and protect your child no matter how hard they are on it, get this gate

This gate us a lifesaver.  Not only do I pets, I have a very adventurus toddler.  This gate is sturdy and very durable.  It is very convienent because it is designed to fit in an area that isnt straight.  My living room has a curve to it so it fits great.  A wonderful item.  Thank you

My 14-month old daughter loves these snack cups. She can monitor her snack time, eating as much or as little as she needs. She loves carrying around a snack cup in one hand and a sippy cup in the other. 

The only reason I give it 4 stars, is because she has a tendency of keeping her hand in the flaps while walking around. This makes single Cheerios fall out here and there. But, nothing compared to giving her snacks in an open bowl. I've only used them on Cheerios so I can't comment on other snacks (she tends to choke on Goldfish so she only gets those while sitting in the high chair).

She hasn't tried taking off the lid like other reviewers, so that's not a problem for us (at least not yet). We use them all the time and I definitely recommend them

I love this product! I works graet as a barrier between your little one and whatever surface he or she is on (e.g. a car seat, high chair, stroller etc.).  It really saves you from having to wash your furniture when the little one has bathroom accidents that leak out of their diapers.  It is great for any aged baby/infant/toddler.  It will really make your life easier. I highly recommend it

These slings have been an essential part of being parents. Both my husband and I use New Native slings on a daily basis. We've been 'wearing' our daughter since day one and continue to now that she is three months. This helped me tremendously in getting to 'know' my baby. It allows me to be responsive immediately to her needs because I can read her cues before she gets to a full blown cry. It helps me accomplish tasks around the house and makes shopping/running errands easy. We do not even own the detachable infant carseats. I cannot imagine having to lug one of those things around! I feel like this had helped her transition from her womb environment to the outside world. It gives her a sense of security even in new situations. Unlike front facing carriers, she can turn her head into our chests if she feels insecure or overstimulated. There are endless benefits to 'wearing' your baby and I feel like this sling has made it incredibly easy for me and my husband to do so. There are no buckles or rings or fasteners, just slide it on. 
If at first you don't succeed, try again later. It may be more comfortable for you and baby at a different stage. Another tip, get moving! The motion is what soothes babies and brings them comfort. 
Again, baby wearing is such a wonderful thing. I suggest you read up on the benefits and find a sling/carrier that works well for you. 
We recommend this one to all new parents and have never had anyone complain

I love my New Native sling! I have used it so many times and find it very easy to use and very versatile.  My baby is a very chubby guy and at 9 months he is 24 pounds and still fits in the sling.  He loves it too, whenever we are out shopping or even at home and he is a little fussy I put him in the sling and he calms right down and snuggles in.  I've even nursed while walking around..in many places: Costco, Disneyland, Walmart! Very discreet.  I also love the fact that it is small enough to fold up and put in my diaper bag, so I always have it.  No bulky rings or padding.  I'm buying them for all my family with babies! I love it, and I've gotten lots of compliments on it.  A must have item!

I used the older type bed rails with my now 6 year old son (that doesn't overlap the mattress) and he had fallen inbetween the mattress and the bed rail quite a few times. I remember one particular instance when he was so wedged in there that I was panicked and thought he had suffocated. I was extremely happy when I discovered this one for my 1 year old daughter that transitioned to a big bed. She is now two and I haven't had one problem with it. I at one point had three on her bed. I went down to two as I pushed her bed up against the wall which only left 2 sides open. I have not had one problem with them. I take them off her bed and use them when we travel. I can sleep at night not worrying that she is going to fall inbetween. I wish they had these when my son was younger :

My 3 1/2 year old son finally graduated into his "big boy bed" with our move into our first house.  That meant we needed to make sure he continued to be as safe in this bed as he was in his crib.  We opted for the Sure Position N Lock Bedrail.  I gave it 4 out of 5 stars mostly because it really does Lock into its Position and stay there.  The weird thing about it, however, is that the pressure bars "POP!".  You'll get the rail in place on the bed, push down on the pressure bars so that they show 'green' to indicate they're locked... then after a while they'll go "POP!" and begin to inch their way UP into the 'red zone', meaning "unlocked".  It's weird!  It doesn't seem to get to the point where the rail is loose on his bed, but it's a loud noise that, until he was used to it, would wake him out of a dead sleep.  All in all, I DO recommend this bedrail for toddlers moving into big beds.  It's been a great source of safety and roll-out-of-bed prevention and it's given my husband and me much peace of mind at night

We have several of these in both the cotton and the fleece.  They are by far better than other baby sleep bags on the market.  They are made well, stand up to a lot of washing, and are soft and comfortable for baby.  The dual direction zipper makes changing a drowsy baby a cinch.  Note that the small is size 1 month up to 6 months, not for a newborn.  We started using these every night once our son outgrew his swaddling blankets.   Two fabric options for keeping baby warm and safe at night- all you need over pj's to make baby feel more secure and comfortable.  A great night's sleep for all!

What a lifesaver this pillow has been for my 2 month old daughter.  When my son wants me to play a game, puzzle or play on the floor.  I just lay her on the pillow so she can watch us and feel apart of our play time.  I have also found it helpful when I fold laundry.  I can lay her down right beside me and she can watch what I am doing.  It props the baby's head up just enough--better than just laying flat on the floor. The lounger also cradles the baby.  I wish that I had found this when my son was a baby.  I recomend this lounger to every new mommy.

This is really a great product. I ordered it for my 6 month old who has only been sitting up a few weeks. It took me a couple of minutes to get it attached to the shopping cart the first time, but once I got the hang of it it's very easy to use. It comes in two pieces; one to use a seat with the harness and a second to secure over the shopping cart handle. I haven't used the handle portion yet as my baby is so interested in looking around she hasn't tried to mouth the handle. She is quite squirmy so the harness keeps her safe and she doesn't mind it a bit. She is very comfortable and can look around and I'm not as concerned about her squirming or climbing out of the cart. I'm very happy with this product and highly recommend it.

I got this tray for my son's daily rides in the car, and it has been terrific! He can eat on it, put his sippy cup into the cup holder, and be totally independent. He can also play on it - cars, crayons, etc., and it holds his books too.

After approximately 9 months of constant use, it cracked. (It is very stiff, of course, but I don't recall anything significant happening to it when it cracked). Worth the money as far as I am concerned.

We purchased this gate for an odd sized opening, because it is expandable.  It attaches to both sides of the opening so you open it on either side.  We have the gate in a very high traffic opening, and it is not only easy to open and close, but has stood up to the bigger kids going in out.  In the evening when the kids go to sleep, we simply unlatch both sides and set it off to the side.  I love it so much, I'm buying 2 more to replace those pitiful pressure mounted gates we have. Works well to keep the dog contained from the baby area also. Quality, durable product.  I definitely recommend it. Target is the only place I have found this gate

This is an awfully cute bedding set and I'm very pleased with it.  It arrived quickly, and is good quality, though the fitted sheet is a little thin, it will still be a good backup.

After checking out all of the boppys, I decided to get the bare naked one and purchase slipcovers.  I have received so many compliments on the pink slipcover -- even the nurses at the hospital loved it!  It is so soft, and I have washed it a few times with no problems (I haven't put it in the dryer, though).  It does not protect the boppy itself from spit-up, etc., of course, since it is not a waterproof cover.  However, I was not expecting it to be waterproof, and the regular boppys without slipcovers are not waterproof, so it's not a big deal to me.  Since I have the plain white boppy, nothing shows through, but this might be an issue for decorated boppys

very efficiently drains about as much milk as I can get with the Pump in Style Advanced for me, and very portable and easy to clean. I use it when I have a little more time or when I don't expect to pump more than a couple ounces (between feedings). Despite Medela's warnings, I would say you could use this to pump daily, aslong as you  are careful to fully drain the breast (massage), but maybe not okay for maintaining supply for multiple pumping in a row

I bought this upon the recommendation of my lactation consultant, and so far I've been very pleased. I wanted to have a few bottles of breastmilk available so my husband could feed our baby when I'm out running errands. There are just a few parts, so assembly, disassembly and cleaning is very easy. But the best part about the pump, is that you can buy different-sized breastshields to use with it. I needed a larger one than what came standard with it. It makes pumping more comfortable. The first few times I used it, I considered switching to an electric pump because I wasn't pumping much milk. But the more I pumped, the more milk I produced. This breastpump is worth every penny. I recommend it to anyone who primarly breastfeeds, but wants the option of being able to have someone else occasionally feed the baby.

I have had the Harmony for seven months and use it about 2-3 times a day.  It it still working great with all the original parts.  I have not had to buy replacement anything.  I do admit I recently tried another pump. It was supposed to more closly mimic a suckling baby.  With in two days I called the company, I got a refund and am back to my Harmony.  This is a great pump and I am so happy that we bought it.  Stop searching and buy this pump

i love this simply designed, sturdy potty. my son loves it which is most important. he has no trouble sitting down on it; no pinching, no crampedness, no tipping over. the well sized arm rests help him up & down & the splash gaurd is high enough to prevent him peeing all over! having only 2 pieces & no crevices or anywhere for stuff to get trapped it is so incredibly easy to clean. the first few days we had it my son thought it was so comfy that he would bring into the living room to sit on & read books! great product, great price. i am now planning on getting another one to leave at my mother's.

I purchased the extention kit for the Superyard XT Play Gate to go with the Play Gate that I purchased. It works great for my new Pomeranian Puppies.  The Play Yard is wonderful for keeping the puppies all in one place and knowing that they are safe.  It will also be nice to pick up and take outside as the weather improves. The fact that is is portable makes it nice to pick up and take it as we travel so I can still provide a safe place for them where ever we happen to be. I love this item and I am very happy I purchased it.  I feel the gate is great for animals, I have not used it with Children as of this time

I bought the whole superyard play yard kit and absolutely loved it. The extra extensions you can buy for it are great. I have it set up in a living room to keep my son from getting near my entertainment center and leaving my living room. I found it to be very durable and sturdy. When my son was younger it worked great as a place for him to play in. As he got a little older and became more mobile I set the play yard up in my living room to keep him from getting close to my television set. You can bend the pieces to form almost any design you choose. I would say that if you child is getting close to 3 years old not to buy this though. It's sturdy but probably not for that age. It can also be used as a place to put your pet in and can be used outside. I'd recommend this highly

My daughter was the most happy when she was in her Halo.  I love these sleep blankets, the cotton ones for use in Florida weather were just perfect and then the colder months the toasty warm fleece.  I wish they would have come in a longer size since she outgrew them in height well before the weight limits.  I recommend them for anyone who wants a good night sleep, your baby will always be just warm enough and not to warm in these fantastic sleepers

Once my daughter grew out of her carters sleeved sleepsacks I was glad I bought these halo sleepsacks.  They are made from awesome fabrics and I like that the zipper ends at their feet (for easy diaper changes).  I highly recommend these to any new mom (or experienced mom).  It left me assured that my daughter didn't wake up in the morning with a blanket over her head.  She is a active baby in her crib. :

This is a great organizer.  I read the other reviews and was a bit skeptical until I received this one.  It is great!  We use the Avent bottles and they, and all of their parts, fit very well.  There are even hooks at the bottom so hang items such a pacifiers.  It did take a little while to figure out how to make it not leak water on the counter, but once we mastered that, all is well

We bought this stroller today in Honolulu at The Bike Factory. Our son is 18 months old, 48 pounds and 40 inches tall (Yes, we know we got a linebacker on our hands) so we had to find something that might last him for the next year or so.  We love that the max weight is 70 pounds, but wonder if the harness system will grow with him being that we have already let out all the slack that is there, I think??!!.  I am going to read the instructions again to see if I might have missed something.  But other than that, the stroller is very sturdy, well-made, and light weight.  It handles like a dream and I wouldn't be afraid to take it to the mall shopping because it is not any wider or more cumbersome than our old Graco.  It folds up to a nice tiny package and fits perfectly in the back our Explorer, where the Graco did not.  I can't wait to take it running down along the beach in the morning.  Oh, and our son loves it too by the way... he watched Elmo in the living room and wouldn't get out until we bribed him with a bath, so it must be pretty comfortable.  Definitely worth every dime, we love it.  I can't say enough good things about BOB either, they are very helpful and their website is pretty informative too, [...

My son is [...] and aside from getting too big for his crib, my sister is having a baby and needs it. I was a bit concerned about making the transition for my son due to his "crib attachment," but this bed made it easy as pie. It's adorable, sturdy and fun. My little boy slept all night in his big boy bed from the very first night and we've never had a problem (we've had it for a month). He loves to drive his match box cars up and down the tracks and stand on the toy box saying "choo choo." It's just been great....I'm so glad we spent the money

My first son had a race car bed which wasn't made very well. We moved him to a big bed when our second child was ready for the toddler bed. Well, we decided to get rid of the old car bed and get him his own Thomas bed for his 2nd birthday since he is OBSESSED with Thomas. BEST DECISION EVER! It is SO much better made that the other plastic beds! And I'm so glad I read the reviews...the springs from the crib fits PERFECTLY in the THomas bed (and it's pretty strong because I can lay in the bed with him at night if I have to). It is really worth the money. If you are looking into a cute toddler bed for a boy, I'd skip the other cute beds and go straight to this one! We all love it

So many convertibles car seat to choose from but the Britax Marathon name kept coming up in every online review as well as every online forum.

I was very pleased that the Marathon can handle a child up to 65lbs in a five point harness. No other seat that I reviewed offered this feature. I also liked the fact that the seat was very easy to use and install with the latch and tether strap.

My son fit nicely at age 7 months and the transition from infant car seat was very pleasant for him as he did not like his Peg Perego Primo Viaggio.

(...)They offered a great selection of colors to choose from and had the color I wanted in stock. 

I believe I made the best choice after very carefull review and hope that this add if published help those whom review my comments

I bought this seat because we have a small eating area in our kitchen, too small for a full-size high chair.  The seat has worked wonderfully from age 5 months to now age 21 months.  I do find the seat hard to recline or sit up but I have only had to do that a handful of times as once you find the right setting for your child it stays there until he/she is ready for the next setting.  The cloth lining is very easy to remove, wash, and put back and the plastic under the seat cover is easy to wipe clean.  The tray is easy to put on, remove and again wipe clean or wash off in the sink.  I have also found the seat easy to take on and off the dining chair when I need the chair for entertaining others.  My daughter has never complained about sitting in the seat and, now that we are no longer using the tray but still using the seat as a booster, enjoys having her own place at the table.  I highly recommend this seat for parents looking to conserve space in their dining areas but not sacrifice convenience or comfort.

Our little 2 year old loves the feeding seat.  We love the fact that she is safely secured while feeding.  I was looking forward to the reclining feature as well, but it is very difficult to adjust and we never use that feature

We have a very small kitchen so I knew I could never have a large highchair. I registered for the Healthy Chair by Fisher Price but after putting my son in it once to try it out I returned it for this one and never regretted it. This one has a higher back, reclines and has a comfortable cushion that is removable and washable (the one I have is better than the one shown. I bought it at babiesrus). It actually comes with 2 cushions and 2 abc/123 plastic mats that go on the tray. My son is very comfortable in it and I love that we can take it anywhere.

I ordered this shade hoping that it would cover all of my baby when we're out strolling in the sun.  It does a pretty good job; only my son's feet and ankles are exposed when he is reclined (my only beef about the product), but I can cover his little piggies and ankles with sunscreen or shoes with no problem.  I like the fact that the shade protects from UV rays and is easily adjustable.  I leave it on my stroller all the time and can still fold up the stroller with it attached.  I think the side pouches are an excellent plus.  I am very pleased with this product and will recommend it to my friends and family

I tried to use my other kiddopotamus shade with my 16 mt old the other day while taking a stroll on the beach. He would not hear of it! He wanted to see out!! I searched the web trying to find another shade to cover him - This was the answer!! I did not want to pay more than 20.00 for the shade and at 15.00 this is a bagin!! I have found it extemely easy to use on my baby jogger. One windy day it did blow in but that was OK with me because I knew it was also blocking the wind from my son's face. If you are looking to extend your stroller's shade area this is the product for you!! I  only wish I had found it before I got rid of my Inglesina stroller because I could not move the shade forward to block the son from my fair skinned child

I've had the Hippo faucet cover for over six months and I think it's great! My son is always sitting near the faucet and this definitely prevents him from getting hurt. It is a little bit of a pain to take off if you need to use the shower but otherwise I think it's worth it!  The only problem I found with the Hippo cover is that it doesn't really dispense bubble bath well.

This thing cracks us up!  We ordered the elephant and our one year old absolutely loves it.  He can play with it, but its secure enough that he can't pull it off.  It was also an absolute necessity for us - now that he crawls around the tub during bathtime, it was only a matter of time before he knocked his head on the faucet.  It puts our minds at ease while entertaining him at the same time.

We had just started to potty train my 2 year old little girl when a trip to Disney World came. To be honest I didn't know what to do because she wouldn't go potty on the big potty.  I felt like we were going to have to take a whole week off from potty training her.  A full week at Disney World was not going to be fun carrying a potty seat around. Then I found this at babies r us!!! What a little blessing to little ones.  It fits perfect on any potty and she can go without being afraid of the potty. Plus it fit perfect in my Wendy Bellissimo diaper bag.  I carry it everywhere!! I don't leave home without it.  Thanks for such a wonderful product that helped make our first trip to Disney World so much better!!

i doubt i could have made it through the first three months without this product.  my daughter had undiagnosed acid reflux and this was recommended as a help.  (after she was diagnosed, we were given zantac... but still used this as well!)  it's a true godsend.  we'd add a dropperful to her formula and presto - she was content!!!  this works far better than mylicon.  it is expensive - but it is completely worth the price.  we called it 'liquid gold' in our house

This is amazing I tell ya, Seriously I've doubted it since my first child, and then my twins ( never got it ) with them, just assumed it was some Hype. Well with my last baby, and finally a girl, I caved. Its hard to hold a baby all day long when you hve 3 other children and a home to keep in order ( or try )

anyway her screams were out of no where, she wasn't happy being put anywhere to sleep other than on you. and sometimes that wasn't good enough.  she cried and cried and waled. it really drove us all bonkers. she isn't a pacifyer baby either, so we were at loss.


she was obviously really gassy, she got hiccups ALOT. She's breastfed and we couldn't figure out what it was, that maybe I was eating? 

Sure enough today we tried it, and she's peacefully sleeping without stirring. I recomend it 110%. My husband got it at his work with a 20% discount, I'm so relieved

I recently received this swing as a gift for my 2 month old preemie.  She LOVES the lights, the rotating stuffed animals, and the sounds.  And she seems comfortable in the seat too.  The seat snaps into two positions, a reclined position and a sitting position.  Additionally, you can set the swing up to go from side to side or forward and backward.

I did have an incident last week where we had some power surges here in the neighborhood WHILE we were using this swing.   When the power came back on, I tried all the different switches to turn it on and it didn't work, then later on, it finally did work.  This swing has so many switches on it and I admit to being too lazy to read the instructions for all of the functions that each of the switches perform.  That said, I don't know if the failure was user error or a quality issue.  It appears to be functioning just fine as of this writing so I think it was me.

Another user cites instability of the stand on this swing.  I have had no problem with this as I tested it carefully before putting baby in.  Also, we leave the swing set up in one place in our house all the time, so we haven't had have to worry about not opening the stand up all the way beyond the initial setup.  This might be more of a concern for someone who needs to put it away and take it back out a lot.

I personally like the fact that the mobile, the rocking, and the sounds are independent of each other, so you have a lot of variety to entertain baby with.  I LOVE the fact that you can use batteries OR the wall outlet to power this thing.  Thank GOODNESS for not being held hostage to battery manufacturers anymore, but having that option if we wanted to use it where electricity isn't available.

I would recommend this swing, but I would check for a reasonable return policy first before buying and keep the packaging for a couple of weeks after you receive it just to be sure you and your baby are happy with it

We also used this netting last spring/summer/fall on our double stroller (limosine style) and our pack-n-play.  In addition to bugs, it keeps leaves, etc. from falling into the play pen.  My in-laws loaned us a second play-pen that was older and larger than the one's sold these days.  The netting also fit that but not as snugly

I actually bought this netting to use as a cover for our baby's cradle (we have two cats and didn't want them to nap in it while the baby wasn't in it).  I've used it once for my Pak n' Play while outside but found it especially useful when my daughter fell asleep in her jogging stroller after a walk in our neighborhood.  Since it was such a nice day I let her nap in in the stroller(it fully reclines) with netting covering the entire stroller.  I feel, that for such a low price, this netting is worth it for whatever reason you chose to use it for

Diaper Genie Stage 2 Refills have helped us eliminate odors in our twins room.  Easy to install and discard.  Our one year old twins use a lot of diapers and they have been eating solid foods for 6 months.  But you have to install them tightly on the Diaper Genie.  If the refill wabbles on its place, then you need to see what's wrong before starting using it.  Otherwise the odors will come out.  The real fact is that it works!!.  And you know, its great to be at home with my twins in their room and have everything tidy.  We used to throw the diapers in the bathroom garbage can, but after a few hours we couldn't stand going in there.  Note: I am the father, and just spend a couple of hours a day with them... My wife could tell you more on how she loves this diaper genie

We received the original co-sleeper as a gift.  We also considered getting a mini co-sleeper and a pack'n'play or similar playard.

The main advantage of the co-sleeper is that you can attach it to your bed so you can reach your baby without getting up.  The original co-sleeper can also be used as a playard.  The playard capacity is up to 50 pounds, most brands are only rated to 30 lb.  Similarly the bassinet level rating is 30 lb. and most brands go to 15.  The co-sleeper itself is about 2 or 3 pounds heavier than a typical playard.  The width is 28" so the co-sleeper can go through our 29" doorways without collapsing, unlike several playards that are around 31".

There is a trick to collapsing the top bars - you have to pull the bar upwards when you press the buttons, then it's easy.  (otherwise you can push until your thumbs are purple and nothing happens)  This is explained on their website and SHOULD have been included in the manual.

I had a lot of reservations after reading other reviews here but am glad I chose to keep the co-sleeper and expect it to use it constantly.  Also, the Arm's Reach canopy is really strong and beautiful and I'm confident it'll keep the cats out

Not sure what all the fuss is regarding assembly.  I just unpacked and assembled it a few minutes ago with no trouble.  Assemble is probably too strong a word, there is no actual assembly or tools involved.  As for the weight, maybe 15 pounds, certainly nowhere near 50.  

The instructions seemed sufficient although I didn't really need to use them.   

Basically, if the fear of difficult assembly reported here is your only concern, don't let that stand in the way of choosing this item.

I've been co-bedding with my 5 month old son since he's been with us, but we recently decided to move to a co-sleeper to give my husband and I a bit more space.  I have friends who used it and read all the amazing reviews so it was a no brainer.  We've run into a few problems:  First we have a modern platform bed that is low to the ground and even at it's lowest the co-sleeper is several inches to high so we've had to switch bed frames for now.  Second the co-sleeper mattress is rock hard and actually sits down about 4 inches from the divider- since I'm used to having him in my arms for night nursing I didn't want to have to reach in and pick him up.  We solved both of these issues by purchasing 2 portable crib mattresses.  Now he has a softer surface to snooze on and I can simply slide him over to nurse or roll myself right up to him... we'll have to remove one of the mattresses once he's a bit bigger so he doesn't fall out, but for now it works!  Hope this helps!

*** I'm adding this a few months after use- I like the idea of the extra space offered by having the co-sleeper attached to the bed, but our son is now 9 months old and has actually slept in it only a handful of times... still prefer to have him in the bed with us!

I think this is a great quality product, and I love the idea of it. However, I find that my son whose 7 weeks old is just not comfortable in it. It's not very soft and it's just so big for him right now. I can get him to sleep in it only if he's completely zonked out beforehand. 
I think the mini co-sleeper might have worked better for us in the beginning. The original might be better as he gets older and can use the play pen part of it.
I do have to add that directions were somewhat difficult to understand without going over them many, many times

I bought this product because it has two most important things I am looking for: portable and the splash guard.  My son feels very comfortable with it that he has been using this since last August when we got it.  The parts are all plastic for easy cleaning. The cushion part of the seat and the the splash guard are all one piece, unlike some other potty seat where the splash guard is an attachment.  So that's very easy to clean.  The entire potty can be disembled to be cleaned and sanitized from inside out, no hard to reach spots.  The seat is soft and contoured with oval opening which is best, unlike a lot of potty I found with a circular small opening.  The seat can be put on adult toilet seat which I started training my son after several use to avoid cleaning the bowl.  The only thing I wish is that this product comes in just the seat without the bowl, then that would be even better!

I ordered this potty chair after seeing the others all had some negative aspects.  This seat is perfect!  My almost 2.5 year old daughter took to it immediately.  It's not too small (she's very tall) but not too big (she has a petite bottom).  It cleans up easily, and is not so lightweight or small that it becomes a toy for her.  The seat part itself comes off to use on a regular toilet, and has handles for the child to steady him/herself.  The bowl insert is large and removes easily for cleaning.  There are also handles on the base that overlap with the handles on the seat so you can easily pick it up and move it.  The lid closes "just like mommy's potty" and becomes a wide flat step stool.  Perfect product

Very easy to use, and comfortable, it didn't bother my daughter when she was asleep. Stayed put pretty well considering how restless my daughter can be. Easy to change off the bed when wet without having to change sheets in the middle of the night. Washed about 30 times and still together and ready to use for my son next year

I replaced our old Ocean Wonders Aquarium soother with this Rainforest Waterfall version about a month and a half ago.  The Aquarium was still working and our baby liked the lights and music, but I was looking for something that would play for a longer period of time.  With the Aquarium, I had to go in her room and press the button a couple of times before she would fall back asleep.  Not fun at 3 or 4 in the morning when all I want to do is fall back asleep.  I had read that the Waterfall soother plays for up to 18 minutes, so I thought I'd check it out.

The soother has 3 different length settings: lights, music/sounds, and movement for 6 minutes; lights and music/sounds for 12 minutes; music/sounds only for 18 minutes.  There are 3 settings for the sounds: rainforest sounds without music; rainforest sounds and lullabies; rainforest sounds and classical music.  There are 3 volume settings as well.

I have ours set for 12 minutes of sounds and lullabies and I rarely have to go back in her room and press the button a second time.  She almost instantly settles down once the music starts.  If I happen to put her down for a nap or for bed while she's still awake, she'll quietly watch the lights and fall asleep on her own.  And I'll admit that hearing the songs and rainforest noises over the baby monitor is soothing and relaxing as I try to fall back asleep.

My only complaint is that the lights seem REALLY bright for something that is supposed to lull a baby to sleep.  I ended up covering ours with a light flannel blanket to dull the light a bit.  The baby can't see the critters, but since I don't have them set to move, it's not really a big deal.

Despite the bright lights, we're happy with this soother

I ordered this changing pad because it has the ends curved up, and not just the sides.  This is also sometimes refered to as a "4-sided changing pad" since all 4 edges are raised.

It seems very sturdy and fits very well on top of my dresser, effectively converting the dresser to a changing table.  The only reason I didn't rate this higher was that it didn't include a non-skid pad on the bottom of the pad.  Also, it would have been nice if it included a sheet or cover.

Next, I need to order some covers for it, since the baby doesn't like being directly against the smooth plastic surface.  I am not sure which covers to order

My son is tiny- born at 5lbs 6oz and very much a preemie. I simply cannot imagine putting him in the infant seat without this. It keeps his entire body in place- not just his head. It provides great support and the soft white fuzzy side is very warm (we havnt used the other side yet.) 

My only complaint is its a bit akward to get the shoulder straps in the correct place around baby- but thats mostly because our baby is still very tiny. once he;s bigger and we can move the headpiece up it shouldnt be a problem

This carseat is a good value.  The pad in the bottom of the seat secures my 4 month old quite well and is removable as well as the head pillow.  I did have to add the infant head support for her neck but that's expected in a 4 month old.  It reclines far enough that her head doesn't fall forward and it's so simple to adjust the straps.  Overall very nice carseat for the money I spent.

I got one of these for my baby shower I loved it so much I went back and bought another one.  Very easy to use. I just put my baby in it before she's going to sleep for the night. There is no need for blankets when using the sleepsack. Puts your mind at ease, no loose blankets in the crib!! Also, reccomend getting the thinner cotton one for the warmer nights

We purchased the Fisher-Price Open Top Take-Along Swing a few months ago for our daughter, and have been very pleased with its quality and performance. We haven't had any problems with the operation of the swing, even as our little one has grown to her present weight of 18+ lbs. It runs on C batteries, which for us seem to last almost a month with moderate use.

This swing has several great features. It folds up very easily and really is as portable as claimed. It pops right in the trunk for trips to Grandma's house, and I've also used it quite a bit in the backyard when I want to do yard work. Having a 5 year-old in the house, I also appreciate being able to quickly carry it from room to room. Being only a flat 5 foot tall with short (and admittedly weak) arms, I have a lot of difficulty carrying the swing with the baby in it, but the swing is lightweight enough to carry one-handed while the baby's in the other arm.

Though I'm pleased with this swing, I'd really recommend it in *addition* to a traditional baby swing rather than instead of one. The compact nature of this swing means that the rocking motion is very fast-moving, unlike the slow, soothing motion of taller swings. My daughter seems to like the Take-Along Swing just fine when she's in an alert, awake mood. When she's tired, however, it just goes too quickly, even on the lowest setting, and seems to overstimulate her rather than calm her down. I'd originally purchased this with the idea of replacing our full-sized Graco swing, but we've ended up keeping both around as they seem to fill different needs. Overall, I'd certainly recommend this swing - but if you're only going to have one swing in your house, you might consider whether you'd be more grateful for a big swing that rocks your baby to sleep, or this little one that entertains during those fussy, bouncy times

These placemats are perfect for a toddler who loves to dump food out and spread it out on the table, especially for when you're out in public places.  They stick onto anything and have fun things for kids to look at (my son is obsessed with anything Sesame Street - esp Elmo - so he loves staring at the placemat).  They're easy to fit into any purse, diaper bag, pocket so they're always accessible.

I wouldn't eat out with my 14 month old and 4 year old without taking along a Table Topper for each of them.  The self-sticking tabs on the top and bottom hold them securely in place, creating a clean surface for toddlers and pre-schoolers to munch on finger foods and place their utensils without worry of restaurant-table germs.   I wish I had thought of these!!  They're a great invention for families on the go

I recently purchased the Zooper Tango Sidy by Side Double Stroller.  I had done some looking at stores & extensive research online.  Suddenly, I found this on Amazon of all places.  The reviews were great & the price was right.  I bought it, a little hesitant that I hadn't gotten to test drive it.  

This stroller is great!  It fits through doorways, it's a little tight in an aisle, but we're talking about a double stroller here, it's going to be a little wide!  I have a 2 year old & 1 year old, so I do find that it veers to the side that my 2 year old sits on, just slightly.  It is heavier than the Peg Perego Aria is, but it feels much more solid.  Folds easily & somewhat compactly (again, it's a double stroller!).  It fits into the back of my Honda Odyssey with room for bags & whatnot.

I would recommend this stroller to anyone with twins or 2 little ones.  My 2 year old likes to "nap" (recline the seat) while we are walking.  The back zips off, she likes to look out the back.  A 5 point harness keeps everyone safe, but I find that I usually just use it as a waist seat belt.  

Storage is limited, my husband wants to customize the basket area - it sounded like his plans involved a hack saw...There is a spot for a bottle of water or misc items (a hanging net type basket - just big enough for a bottle of water) & a zip pocket on the back of the stroller.  However, if you unzip the back & remove it, you have lost this pocket.  I did read that McClaren has a stroller organizer for about [...] - we were planning on buying this to carry more stuff.

Overall, I do love our new stroller & would highly recommend it!

We really enjoy this travel system.  Having a car seat that fits into both the base and the stroller allowed us to leave our sleeping daughter undisturbed when moving her in/out of the car.  Being off of work for 3 months, I didn't have to feel cooped at home when I could easily take my daughter to the store or the park.  As big as the stroller is compared to umbrella strollers, we still prefer to take it, because the diaper bag and other items fit easily underneath, the seat-back folds down (allowing sleep or diaper changes), and it has THREE cupholders, 2 side pockets that can hold other items (burp cloth, bottled water, toys), and a little compartment for sunglasses or cell phone.  The basket underneath is accessible hands-free by pressing up or down on the basket with your foot.  The stroller fits in the trunk of our compact Saturn 4-door, or if necessary, in the front passenger seat (upside-down to fit in the wide wheels, which are anyway relatively easy to remove).  The loaded stroller is easy to guide with one hand, so I can push it if I happen to be carrying my daughter.  The stroller is sturdy and smooth enough to take down the street, on paved park paths, and we always use it on the packed sand at the beach (it even works over the brief path over the unpacked sand, if you go backwards).  In her car seat in the stroller, she could get complete protection from the sun and light rain with the two canopies, although I found that a draped blanket allowed for more air flow.  We took the whole system on a 10-day trip, which included a flight out of town, and I felt like our load was lighter than those we took before our daughter was born.  At 6 months, she has just outgrown the car seat (but she's basically off-the-charts in her height/weight), but we still use the stroller now that she can sit up.

Drawbacks, all fairly minor:  Not easy to close stroller one-handed.  Wheels are wider than the carriage appears from the top, so I'm always banging the wheels on something.  It takes a few minutes to remove/replace washable carseat cover, but this is probably necessary due to the straps.  As with any carseat, we would suggest getting help by certified people with proper installation of the carseeat in your car; we had many questions on installation, particularly since our car lacked the LATCH system.  We purchased a second base so we didn't have to remove the one in our car for our trip or for our babysitter's car

I received this as a baby shower gift from my Mom and love it! It is so easy to manuever, you can do it with one hand. The stroller has ample space for bags, purse, etc. below and side pockets for cell phone or smaller items. The drink cup holders for mom and baby are a plus. The material is so pretty and the colors are great. The best feature is how the system allows you to completely protect the baby, should you get stuck in the rain or other bad weather. I would highly recommend this item.

My wife bought this one when my daughter was 2 months old. We feed our daughter with bottles (mix formula with breast milk), and since each time we need to take the bottled breast milk from ref (my wife did breast bumping), and mix with formula, we use this warmer all the time. Also, when we travel out, this one is quite useful. Generally with only a little small amount of water, the bottle is warm enough to feed my baby. Also it is quite compact to put in the diaper bag (well, not compact bag though)

I think that this is a great stroller for traveling.  I have a 4 year old and she loved riding in it.  We used it on our Vacation to disney World and it was wonderful for all of the walking we had to do.  It fit in tight spaces and was very easy to manuever.  It was light weight and easy to use. Overall I am glad that I had this great strolle

This seems like a really sturdy, lightweight stroller. I just wanted something simple and strong that can get us out of the house quickly--we live in a very hilly, sort of rustic area, so I needed something I could take my son to the park in without hauling out the big buggy. This is really light, and it folds and has a carrying strap in case the boy wants to walk a bit. (There is also a storage bag for travel.)
 
The tires have treads on them, so they can handle steep terrain, and they give a pretty smooth ride over bumps. The fabric is sort of a thick canvas-sy polyester--not removable, but it seems like it could easily be scrubbed/hosed clean if necessary. The seat also has some padding and back support (although, on the con side, it's probably not the coolest compared to mesh). The weight limit is given as 37 lbs, so my 19-month old still has plenty of room to grow--his shoulders are comfortable and his feet don't reach the footrest yet (he is 27 pounds and about 33 inches tall). On the plus side, it seems bigger than the Wrangler All-Weather umbrella stroller, plus it reclines a bit (you unzip/unbutton the sides to allow the fabric to unfold), unlike the Volo. 

The square canopy is maybe not the greatest (it only covers the face, and could actually sit a little higher I think)--but as for everyone complaining that it falls off, I have found that when you flip the canopy to the back, if you then detach the back flap from the seat, you can  attach the side flaps to that velcro on the back to keep it from sliding off. 

Some people have also mentioned kicking the wheels, but I'm 5'6" and haven't had any problems--I think it's a matter of not standing right on top of the thing since it's an umbrella stroller and doesn't have a superwide wheelbase. 

I would give it 4.5 stars I think, but am giving 5 because of the great price! I'm pretty happy with this--and my son is constantly trying to climb in, so he must like it too... I figure that with the money we saved, we can buy a nice Kettrike or some other form of transportation the boy can grow into.

We've used this since my daughter was about 7 1/2 months old; she's now 2 1/2 and we've never had any problems with it.  This is the best stroller for quick trips to the mall, park, etc.    The sunshade is great and the built in carrying strap is a good idea too.  We've never used the rain cover, so I can't comment on that.  It doesn't have a storage basket, but I don't know many umbrella strollers that do.  For longer trips, we just take our full size Combi stroller if we need the storage or full recline option.  I would definitely recommend this stroller for a light "quick outing" stroller to keep in the car.

I love this bath tub!  We were not happy with my son's infant bath tub, so we were anxious to move into this one!  It fits so nicely in the big tub and offers my son the added protection he needs.  When you're done with it, it just suctions to the bathroom wall to dry.  The best part is that we'll be able to deflate it and store it easily.  It's also great for traveling

I actually got the Snug Tub Deluxe.  This version comes with inflatable rings that baby can stack on the inflatable post.  It also has an attached inflatable fish that wheezes when you squeeze it.  I used it for the first time tonight and my 6 month old baby enjoyed the freedom to splash and play.  My only caution is to use something to keep baby from slipping.  I put her baby sponge underneath her to elevate her and propr her up.  This was also good to lean her back to wash her hair and to keep her from slipping.  I'm glad I bought this instead of the EuroBath

We bought this tub because our son struggled with the bath seats.  He was too big for the infant bath tubs but certainly couldn't handle the full size version.  This tub is a perfect in between option.  The only thing that could make this product better is a slip resistant bottom to the tub

My son has now 'graduated' to the regular tub but we used this tub for a year. It is perfect for when they are too big for the 'seats' and your tub doesn't accomdate the rings. In fact this is much better than a ring the babies sit in because there is pleanty to cusion them when they tumble over or slip trying to stand. Ours has withstood a year of use so far and we'll be using it with the next baby too

I have used this system for 9 weeks now.  The bottle will leak if you do not tighten the ring enough or correctly - I test shake before I feed and if its wrong I unscrew and reseat the nipple.  My daughter has less gas with these bottles than with the Playtex bottles I tried.  If your child gags as one reviewer commented you need a slower nipple.  I use the standard nipples and not the adjustable flow nipples.  I have the adapter system that allows me to pump into the bottle and I like the convenience of being able to cap that bottle when done and refrigerator it until feeding time.  These bottles do well in the dishwasher and clean up easily

This is the best bed rail if you DO NOT have a box spring. My 2 year old recently moved into his toddler bed and I purchased this rail because he has a "bunkie" board instead of a box spring. The length is satisfactory, and the fold-down mechanism is perfect because of the raised hinges. It is easy to make the bed as well. We also purchased it for the grandparent's house because they have a platform bed. It works equally as well. My only complaint is that maybe the rail isn't high enough but my son hasn't been tempted to climb over it. I would recommend this bed rail for a good transition to a "big boy" bed that doesn't have a box spring (although the manufacturer recommends it)

I am a pretty picky shopper, but I have fallen in love with this product.  My now 6 1/2 month old daughter has terrible reflux and this is the only place I could ever get her to sleep comfortably.  She still sleeps in it (at 18 pounds, it is still safe up to 25 or when they can crawl out).  There is a cushion for newborns and it is removable for use for older babies.  

Save the money you'd spend on a co-sleeper, swing or a bassinet and try this instead.  I buy it for every baby shower I attend.

We love this glider as does our 6 week old!  She has reflux so this has been a life saver!  She sleeps in it and enjoys the gentle gliding back and forth as she falls alsleep.  We swaddle her and tuck her, turn on the side to side glide and set her womb bear on the edge of the glider....off to slumber land she goes...We highly recommend this

Ok so I purchased this when my son was 4 months old.  I always thought it was pretty neat, but figured he wouldn't sleep in it, because it seems to glide too slow.  My son wouldn't sleep in anything, but his swing. I wanted to get him something bigger that may slightly imitate the swing that I know he'll sleep in. So based on reviews I got this product.  At first I was a little disappointed, because at night as soon as I laid him in it he would start too fuss like he did everything else, except his swing.  I just figured maybe I should have bought it a couple of months ago.  But, what I did was put one of his big blankets in it and laid him on top of it and whadduya know? He sleeps in it more than his swing now!  I guess it wasn't as cushiony as he wanted it to be.  I kind of noticed that too, when I got it that it appeared not to be as cushiony.  Another disappointing thing is that the music volume is a little loud even on the lowest setting, so I don't even use it.  Aside from that it's great.  The motor noise doesn't seem to bother me or my son.  It isn't very loud to me.  But anyway he sleeps in it, which allows me to get more me time and sleep time at night.  I would say my money is well spent

This product helps my colicky baby sleep through the night, especially since she can't kick off the blankets. I highly recommend it.  Sizing is different than baby r us. I'm probably going to have to do some exchanges so thought I'd provide info.

X-Small (Newborn) 5 to 10 lbs
Small (up to 6 months) 10 to 18 lbs
Medium (6-12 months) 16 to 24 lbs
Large (12-18 months) 22 to 28 lbs
X-Large (18-24 months) 26 to 36 lb

I haven't been able to find the sizing info. for the sleepsacks on this site, so I called the Right Start (they also carry them but for $24.99) and they said that the large size is for 22-28 pounds.    Just thought I'd put this info. out there for everyone - hope it helps

As we all know, you're supposed to put your baby to sleep on his back to help prevent SIDS. The SleepSack is a great product! It keeps baby nice and warm, yet you don't have to worry about a blanket. And there's space down in the bottom for his feet so he's not too restricted. Also, the great thing is that it zips from top to bottom, so you don't have a big zipper poking baby in the face

I bought this same mattress in 2004 for my first son, and we never had any problems.  Easy to clean and firm; yet soft enough for my son to sleep through the night starting at 3 months.  When we were surprised at the news of a second, I bought this from Amazon on sale--the fabric design is different (blue and white checks), but otherwise it seems the same to me.  But one comment: if you don't get it on sale here you might try to buy it in store because the shipping is around $20.  It depends on what you're willing to pay for convenience

I would like to ditto (and thank!) the reviewer who suggested the CVS brand covers.  After reading her review, I purchased the covers from cvs.com . Then I thought about checking at Walgreen's, and sure enough, they carry them (same price as CVS, 40 for $5.99).  I just picked up a box today.  So I will soon have a bunch of covers, but I don't care.  I just love this thermometer.  I actually have the one with the light on it.  Outstanding product

     this stroller is the BEST 250.00 that i have spent in a long time!!  we live in texas and were using a regular double stroller to walk the dog with our 2 daughters (aged 16 mo's and 3) around a one mile loop in our neighborhood.  depending on weather and moods sometimes we'd do 3 laps.  it was such a CHORE pushing that old stroller up and down our neighborhood hills.  plus, i can actually JOG or even RUN!!!  i can't tell who loves it more, me, the dog, or my girls.  it's light, easy to steer, worth EVERY penny.  plus, i love the fold out visors for shade for the girls.  oh, and it was incredibly easy to put together

We had the forerunner (Diaper Genie 1).  No matter what I did, it still stunk.  I would add baking soda after poopy diapers, line it with an odor protecting garbage bag as well as the normal liners.  It always smelled like poop!!  One day it broke, so we looked for a replacement.  I was a little hesitant to purchase this product because of our previous one, but we thought we would give it a try.  It's amazing.  My daughter had diareha and a day later still no stench!!!  Also, it's so easy.  No twisting.  Just put the diaper thru the trap door.  It's easy to load and change cartridges.  This is definately a great buy!!!

I love the plug-in feature, there's been many times I've left the swing on (have to rush to change a diaper and left it on). True, it will stop if lightly touched or a blanket falls. 

The swing isn't incredibly fast, but for my 2 month old, it's worked well. There are two volume levels for the music, but I've only used the lowest setting.

This high chair is so easy to put together and use.  My grand-daughter loves this chair, the music and toys on top occupy her.  I like how it changes height and reclines.  My grand-daughter was using this chair when she was 3 months.  The recline position came in handy!  I would buy this chair again and highly recommend it to friends and family

I bought this chair for my third child and wish I would've had it for the first two as well. It is easy to assemble, easy to use and easy to clean. I like the recline feature and 5 point strap because my baby could sit/lay in it at a fairly young age. I love the wheels because I could rock him with my foot and talk to him while doing dishes or making dinner.  The one hand release on the tray is a dream for Moms who could use eight hands! My son seems to enjoy the toys, too. I only wish it came with extra trays

We love this tub & still use it with our daughter that is now almost 9 months old.  The incline position is great when they aren't quite ready to sit on their own.  We used to just place this over our kitchen sink & give her baths there. Now, we place it inside our regular bathtub because she isn't quite ready to be in the big tub yet.

I like this sheet so much better than the thin ones.  It offers more padding and seems so much more comfy!  It is a tight fit, but I had no problem fitting the sheet onto my Eddie Bauer pack n play.  So, I would assume it should fit any pack n play.  Just make sure to wash in cold water, and hang dry.  I never put this in the dryer.  The only thing I don't like is the color.  It happens to match my navy blue playard, but I wish it came in some lighter colors

I have two children now, and I wish this item had been available when my older daughter was born.  I have tried everything to keep my babies' heads from slumping over in the car, and nothing worked 100% of the time.  This however does.  It is one of the best things I have ever purchased for my child and it's very inexpensive

Finally! A big, spacious, nice looking toy box!!  I looked for a long time for a toy box that could set out in our family room and still blend in to the rest of the decor, but was bigger than the little wooden toy boxes that are out there!  The lid has finally improved from the old ones where the lid never stayed up.  The drawers on the bottom are small, but hold a few things, and don't take anything away from the big interior of the box.  It makes the box look more sofisticated!!  Love the new colors and design.  Thanks Little Tikes!

This toy is a favorite of my 10 month old. He likes the crinckle fin and the mirror. He also loves the music, which calms him down when he is crying. The music is soothing and doesn't grate on our nerves even though we've heard it many times. 

My only complaints are that there are just two short tunes that play alternatively and you have to press his belly fairly hard each time you want one to play. It would be nice if there was a setting to have them play a few or more times. There are pictures with words on one fin that are useless and there to fit the Einstein theme.

All in all, a good product that I would buy again.

By the way, the thing he is wearing on his head is a diving mask and a snorkle

All rubbery squirt toys have the issue of the black stuff, there's no avoiding it.  We squirt them til empty at the end of every bath.  My kids love the net and little fish, as well as the other toys.  No problem with paint loss on the net as of yet and we've had it over 2 years.

Used an infantino front carrier for several hours a day until my back started to hurt.

Purchased the ultimate baby wrap based on the reviews here. I liked the idea of even weight distribution and being able to put baby in different positions. 

While using the wrap isn't intuitive (ie watch the dvd) it's easy to learn.

My back problems are gone and baby is more snug in the wrap (tummy to tummy) than in traditional front carriers. I wanted to use the sling position but baby is too big length and width wise.

Only gripe is that there is no neck support in the tummy to tummy position so I have to hold baby's head while I rock her to sleep. 

Would recommend this product, great price too

Based upon reviews, I decided to go with Dr. Brown's from the start. We've been very happy with them! A friend had given me some Avent bottles she had never used so I decided to try them & compare. My baby had a terrible tummy ache & had never before burped so much. Those Avents now sit in the back of the cabinet gathering dust.

For folks who complain about leakage....the rare times that has happened to me was when I accidentally added milk past the top marker. Otherwise, I've never had a single problem with any sort of leakage.

Another plus is that they're very easy to clean; I just pop all the pieces into the top rack of the dishwasher (I use a toddler basket to hold some of the smaller pieces). 

If you're comparing the wide mouth to the standard, forget the standard! They're a pain to get liquid into (but still good bottles).

I absolutely love this product & would never consider another bottle

I was very cautious with my first child concerning the crib.  Nothing was inside except the sheets and baby.  As you can imagine, this led to many sleepless nights of baby waking due to legs and arms getting tangled in the rails.  So, number two baby reaped the benefit of me not being such an over-cautious parent and utalizing this wonderful bumper!  I still worry about SIDS but I feel this bumper has allowed for many restful nights for baby and mommy.  Highly recommend

This is great for young babies..once my son became more active (which is when it's safe to use a regular crib bumper anyway) he would put his legs on it and it would scrunch down since it's very thin - unlike the big padded more sturdy bumpers that come w/ a crib set.  I think that is the only flaw but I will definitely use it again for my next infant/baby

I bought this after fidning my 2nd child who is 4 months old caught under the headboard bumper that came with his bedding.  This is my 2nd child & I have never been told of this danger.  I highly recommend this bumper.  It comes in 2 pieces, the shorter one goes across the front railing that you move up & down, the longer piece goes from the last slat on the headboard to the last slat on the footboard.  There are only 2 gaps which are where the handles for the railing are.  I was also able to weave a few places along the sides to make sure he couldnt get underneath.  I love that it's wide so that it reaches down to the mattress, it velcros at each end across both the top & bottom for a tight fit, it will collapse if an older baby tries to step on it but is still very tight & that it's very breathable but still has a little cushion to it.
I just wish that I had known of the danger of traditional crib bumpers.  Thankfully I heard my son screaming when I did.  HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT, or one like it to avoid suffocation hazard from stuffed bumpers

I replaced my baby's old bumper with this one when she became mobile.  It works fairly well in keeping her from getting her arms or legs caught in between the crib slats.  The only complaint I have is that the "short" section of the bumper can be pushed down quite easily by the baby, thus defeating the purpose of keeping arms/legs inside the crib

This protects our leather seats well but is much wider than the infant carrier base which crowds the other passengers sitting next to the baby.  Otherwise a good product.

This seatsaver is one of the few wide enough and tall enough for SUVs.  In contrast to one of the other reviews (and I am NOT affiliated with the seat manufacturer), this seat does the job adequately, and one should not post a poor rating without researching the specs, measurements, fit, etc., IMHO.  There is no &quot;universal&quot; seat saver or, for that matter, car seat, that will fit every car.  This one manages to catch most of the itty-bitty things that kids manage to somehow accumulate and is sturdy enough for the car seat not to make indentations on the actual seat, and hence, serves its purpose well

I like this because it is a nice construction.  I bought the white and it blends in nicely.  I just wish it was a little higher.  We have a newer construction home and the bathroom counters are high so it is still too low for her to wash hands by herself for now.

My 3 yr. old son use it everyday to brush his teeth and comb his hair.  He doesn't tip over and fall anymore like he did on the other step chair.  The babybjorn is a bit expensive.  I found a similar chair at Ikea for a fraction of the cost.

If you're going to get the Baby Bjorn potty chair, you've got to get a matching stool!  I love how the stool has a rubbery-grip top to prevent slipping.  My son also uses the stool to read his books on while sitting in his matching potty chair.  You've gotta get one now

I really like how this step was designed to stay in place.  We have a cheaper plastic stool in another bathroom that tends to scoot too easily as our son climbs up on it.  This one stays put!  The only reason this stool didn't get 5 stars from me is because of the textured top.  It is a little difficult to clean.  Since this is a potty step stool, it has gotten some messes on it that I wish would have been easier to get rid of

I bought this thinking it was a gimic. Worse case was my daughter would get a night light on her bed. Turns out this actually works. Her bedroom is filled with stars. She uses it every night and I use it to check on her. It is still using the original batteries, 30+ days. The amber color does not work so good but her walls are pink. On white it might work better. Get it for something diffrent that works

I've had this seat for some time and I saw all of the negative reviews. It took a bit to figure out the quirks, but once I did, it was fine. The seat has to go on the very front of the public toilet, not the back or in the middle like mine at home. You have to make sure that it is on securely with the lip in the front against the front of the seat. Otherwise it will fold, which is probably what happened to the other reviewer. It will slid off as you come off if you're not careful. My five year old uses it by herself and I use it with my 2 year old. It is so compact that I can stick it in my purse (I carry in in a zippy bag) and very easy to clean. There aren't too many of this type of product out there, but for me, it works just fine

After using a smaller plastic tub and a blow up tub, this one is the best!  I only wish I would've just bought this one to begin with.  My little guy is 6 months old, 24 pounds but can't sit up yet.  He still uses the side that lays him down in the water, and he loves it!  Don't waste your money on other tubs, this one is the best.  This one will grow with your child while saving water too

I ordered this pack after my friend's baby shower, she received this as a gift and I was amazed at how nice it was.  It fit both her and her husband very well, so I ordered one to carry our 7 month old daughter in.  WE love it.  It is easily adjustable and fits my husband and myself great.  Our daughter squeals in delight whenever she is in it, it has made our walks more enjoyable, I have free hands to hold our dogs' leashes and she likes being up to see everything.  I only have one complaint and that is the pocket on the belt is almost impossible to access when wearing the pack, but it is so minute of a complaint I still give it 5 stars.  Oh yeah the price is amazing for the pack you get, I cannot wait to go on a day hike.  I had been pricing other packs and they were close to $200, this was$90 w/ free shipping, a huge price break, plus I got it in about 3 days, thanks Amazon

I bought this backpack after reading several of the other reviews and I am glad I did! I did some shopping around at local stores and all of the other backpacks I found were either MUCH more expensive or were the same price but had fewer features.  
My 7 month old daughter loves this backpack.  In addition, we don't need the diaper bag because it has so many pockets. I did not have any trouble putting on the sun visor and the backpack is very easy to store and use.  I originally bought this backpack to take abroad in place of a stroller but I can see that it is going to be handy in places like the zoo and grocery shopping as well. I don't know how it would do for serious campers, but for every day use it has been GREAT.

I bought this carrier for a recent trip my family took and I am so glad I had it!  I used it for my 8 month old to carry her around instead of using a stroller.  There are many pockets which have plenty of room to store all your needed items and the stand works well to set down on the ground when not wearing it.  My daughter seemed to be quite comfortable in it and at one point even fell asleep.  She loved being able to see everything around her at our level.  I am 5'3" and my husband is 6'1" and we both wore it comfortably.  I would recommend this item to anyone needing something smaller than a stroller

I bought these sheets online since I couldn't find any in the local Babies R' Us store and did so with hesitation.  But when I received them I couldn't be happier with them.  The best thing about these sheets, besides that they fit perfectly, is the velcro strips on the bottom of the sheets to insure they stay snug

These are wonderful! My baby was getting uncomfortable being swaddled at about three months, so we decided to make the switch to sleep sacks. We were worried that with her arms free that she might have a hard time falling and/or staying asleep. This was true at first so we started by only putting her in these during the daytime - in a light cotton one. After about a week she was not waking early from her naps anymore and after two weeks we tried her in it at night - and she slept straight through the night (as she did when she was swaddled). So the transition was painless and she seemed a much happier baby to be able to reach her hands and move her arms.

While I didn't notice shrinkage I did notice that the zipper does bunch up a bit, but this hasn't been a problem. Sometimes my daughter sucks on it if it gets close to her mouth, but she has to reach for it - it doesn't cover her face at all or trap air that she could rebreathe. 

I didn't like that these don't have sleeves so I tried Carter's sleep sacks and found the sleeves to be too short and hard to get on my daughter. Those sacks only come in one size which my daughter has already outgrown at four months (14 lbs, 24 inches). She has also outgrown the small size sleep sack, but the medium size fits her perfectly with some room to grow.

I didn't want to use fleece at first since it is polyester. I wanted to use cotton. But we've found that she sleeps longer and seems to prefer he heavier fabric of the fleece one.

Also, we only bought these in blue even though we have a girl because the color is calming to our easily overstimulated baby. 

We've washed these many times and they look just as good and hold together just as well as they did originally. 

We've also found you can put your baby into the next larger size without it being so big that they can get their arms out or that it bunches up around their face. So after everything we've tried we've loved these sleep sacks from day one

my baby is now 5 months old, and we've been using the Halo sleep sac since she started moving around more.  I was always worried with the regular blanket because more than a few times she would wake up crying because she had kicked her regular blanket onto her face!  Now, I never worry that she will soffocate or that she will be cold in the middle of the night.  This product really gives me peace of mind and I'll be sure to give this to any new parent friends

This particular pillow is wonderful because it is not cumbersome or too large to manage yet does everything my wife needs it to do.  I hardly know this pillow is in bed with us, and when I do notice it I can't help but to think of how nice and soft it is.  A great thing about the main squeeze is it is so versatile.  The pillow can be twisted and bent into any desired position.  This is a great product and I highly recommend it to all who are looking for something that will support all legs, pregnant belly, and face and hands.  One nice thing I forgot to mention is because it is sleek my wife has no problem turning with it when she feels the need to be on her other side.

My daughter recently had her second child, and spends alot of time breastfeeding. This product allows her to pump at her convenience. She can have others hold and feed the baby while she spends some time with her other child. The product works very well. She said it takes a little bit of experimenting and adjusting to get it set to work best for her, but it is an excellent product. She previously had a less expensive product by another manufacturer, and heard how good the Medela brand was from a friend. This brand is a pleasure to work with after using the less productive, noisier pump she had before. We would highly recommend this product, and the product is well worth the price paid

It's expensive but worth it. It's nice to take to work because it looks professional (many people didn't even know what it was) and it comes with a cooler so I didn't have to put my milk in the fridge next to everyone's lunch. A friend also bought one around the same time and says she got it much cheaper on eBay for a brand new one.

I LOVE this pump!

If you're going to breastfeed, you NEED this pump.  It's expensive, but worth the investment.  I pump at least 10 times a week and it's just so much easier than the manual pump I tried.

I got this pump as a hand-me-down from my friend. It worked great even after many years... I eventually purchased the Pump In Style Advanced Limited Edition where the pump can be separated from the bag. It takes up less desk space (no extra space required for the bag). Also, it's more portable if all you need is the pump. I pump all over the house (study, bedroom, living room while watching TV with my husband).

Just a note to some people having problems getting milk out with the Medelas... It may not be the pump itself but the size of the flanges. Every woman's breast and nipples are different sizes. Initially, I was using the standard 24mm flanges (suction cup things that go over your breasts). It was painful to pump and my milk would not come out even though I was engorged with plenty of milk. It would take me 2 hours just to get 2 oz of milk! I went to see a lactation consultant who suggested I try the next size up flanges (27mm). She got me one to try and it made a world of difference. I could immediately pump 2oz in under 5 mins. Now, I pump daily to stock up and can get 4 oz from both breasts in under 10 mins (estimate since I don't really time it cause it's so fast).

I am now planning to pump to donate my milk to a milk bank. This pump made a world of difference.  I think Medela makes flanges in 3 different sizes. The standard 24mm that comes with all their pumps, the 27mm and a 30mm.

This potty seat is the only toilet training item I have bought. I highly recomend it! My daughter thinks she is a big girl on the big potty. You need a step stool for them to get up on their own. I like that the seat is sturdy enough to withstand a 30 lb. 3 ft. 2 yro. climbing up & situating her self with out my help because ultimatly that is the goal & this product I feel helps get to that goal.

This sleepsack keeps our little bundle warm & toasty on those cold san francisco nights.  it is really easy to use & to move from the carset to the stroller.  i do wish it zipped up just a little higher on the sides, but it's the best thing around we've seen.

This fit very easily into my daughter's Graco infant car seat.  As the other reviewers said, it is very convenient and keeps my daughter nice and warm.  Wind has not seemed to be a problem, but then I only carry her between the car and my destination in it.  I would recommend this to a friend

Our baby was born in early October and we put the Bundleme on her carrier immediately.  We live in Chicago and have had warm weather (75 degrees) and cold weather (10 below) since then.  We love this cover.  The top easily zips off for those rare warm days or if we are strolling though the mall. It also has kept her very warm and toasty on cold windy days. The day when it was 10 below freezing, she was zipped up in the cover with only a winter hat on and your typical outfit.  I was concerned for her warmth, but when we unzipped her she was as toasty warm as could be.  We have not had to buy a winter jacket.  It has also kept her dry through a couple of rain storms. 
I have gotten numerous compliments on this cover (almost every time we take her out) and it still looks like new, even though many things have gotten spilled on it.  I would highly recommend this product

I love how wide they are.  This makes them much easier to clean and to handle.  Since they are shorter I can fit them on short shelves in my fridge when I use the stopper caps on them.  I can also fit them in my milk cooler in my breast pump because they are short.  My baby is able to hold them with ease since they are wider than other bottles.  Her arms don't have to stretch as far.  

I haven't had any real problems with these bottles.  I was weary to use them after a friend complained about the leaking problem.  I went ahead with them because my sisters said they didn't have any problems with them.  They have leaked twice but only because I didn't screw the lid on all the way because my hands were wet.  Any bottle will leak if you don't screw the lid on sufficiently.  I have used plenty of other brands that has worse leaking issues when I watched my twin cousins.  We tried three different brands and weren't ever really happy with any of them

I wouldn't call this a "rocker seat" The kick-stand on it makes it look like a rocker, if you put the stand down..the legs almost touch the floor. You can make it move a little if you have wood floors, but not enough to call it a rocker. If you have a very mellow baby, this chair is perfect. My baby likes to sit and stare at the toys. But if you need any type of movement for your baby to stay calm, I wouldn't recommend this chair.

The music/sounds on it is very nice, not annoying at all. I don't use the vibration on it yet, until my baby can itch his cheeks if needed. The only reason I say 4 stars and not 5 is because it is falsely advertised as a "rocker", other than that, it is very cute, and my baby enjoys it alot!

I wish I would have bought this bouncer when I first found it.  My son was heavier and quickly outgrew his other bouncer. This one holds up to 40 pounds.  I didn't buy it right away as it was a bit pricey for me.  So I tried to get it on ebay but was always outbid at the last minute. Then I realized that if those people could get $35+; then I could too when I was done with it. So I finally ordered it when my son was 6 months old and 19 pounds.  He loves it. I love it.  It's made very well. If I had bought it when I first found it I would have gotten 4 more months of use out of it. So don't hesitate. You won't be sorry.

I have had two kids use my Evenflo carseat.  I HATED it. It was like they never even tried it out to see how well its features worked.  I finally got so sick of it when my 2nd child was 4 months old that I ordered a Babytrend Flexloc.  At first I was seduced by the high safety ratings, but even after that Consumer Reports article was rescinded, I still liked a lot of the features.

Pros:
-very comfy seat, good padding 
-the canopy is twice as long as my Evenflo so it can cover baby almost completely
- the canopy stays in place; it doesn't fall forward or backward behind the seat
- the tightening mechanism under the baby's feet is easy to reach and VERY easy to adjust to make the straps tighter or looser depending on what baby is wearing
- the harness mechanism is very easy to adjust (the shoulder strap height). My Evenflo had to be rethreaded every few months and even my mechanically inclined husband said it was horrible.  The Flexloc is just a dial on the back that you turn--it's a breeze.
- The seat can be transfered between cars without the base.  It can be strapped directly to the car by using a seat belt on the car seat or by using the LATCH system if your car has it.
- the triangular handle has a nice grip and is easy to hold in any position
- this carseat is lighter than my Evenflo
- The cloth is very wipeable, not as absorbant of spills and stains as my Evenflo


Cons:
I found a few minor cons that definitely would not deter me from buying this carseat, and one that might (depending on how I can resolve it once I contact Babytrend).
- The release button to take the seat off its base is at the toes under the seat.  It's a little harder to reach than the ones behind the head if the carseat is backward facing.
- As others have said, the buttons to move the handle are a bit stiff, but not horribly so.  I was prepared for them to be way worse.
- The handle is thinner and doesn't FEEL as sturdy as my Evenflo when carrying baby around, but it hasn't had any problems
-This is the one BIG one that I have to check with Babytrend on:  Twice when I have turned a corner sharply, the carseat has tipped to a 45 degree angle!  I have tightened down the seatbelt as much as I could, putting my full weight on it and using the seatbelt retracting mechanism.  But maybe I'm still not doing it right.  The base is narrower than my Evenflo's was, so maybe that's why?  So I need to contact Babytrend and see if they have any suggestions.  Until then, I guess I'll take the corners slower!

Overall, I have felt like this seat was a MAJOR improvement over my Evenflo and even over the Graco Snugrides I checked out at the store.  It was intelligently designed to be easy to use and adjust as baby grows. I would recommend it for sure.  Just make sure you strap it in tightly or use the LATCH system if you have it

I don't generally write reviews but wanted to praise Baby Trend on the design of this car seat.  We were directed to it after the January 07 Consumer Reports review showing this as one of only two infant car seats to pass their more stringent crash tests (TV news showed alarming video of various car seats flying around the passenger compartment after being struck by a vehicle).

Compared to our still-new Safety 1st seat, this one is so much better engineered in a number of ways:

1) The base is super easy to install.  Click twice into each of the car's two anchor points, then tug on each of the two straps to tighten the base.  That's it.  Our old seat had paragraphs of confusing directions that didn't leave me as confident as this one.
    
2) The base has an easily adjustable tilting mechanism and leveling indicator to insure you get the right angle for the baby's head (no flopping).  Our old seat had no such system - we used rolled-up towels.
    
3) The seat has a dial to quickly adjust the seat height as the baby grows.  No such system on our old seat.
    
4) The handle has an ergonomic triangle shape on top for more secure grasp when reaching into the car from the left or right.
    
5) If the base is not available, the seat can be strapped directly into a car using the car's lap belt.
    
6) The seat is overall more narrow than our old seat, allowing our two other kids to fit in the back seat with a little more breathing room.  Every inch helps.
    
7) The seat is lighter than our old seat, although it feels just as secure  and solid as the old one.
    
All this, and the seat is the same price as our old one.  Unfortunately Amazon/Target was sold out when the Consumer Reports issue came out, but I found them in stock online at Wally World, if you are looking to get one quickly.  The one for sale here is a better color combo than Wally's, unless you like lime green - but the seats themselves are all the same superb design.

Summary: super easy to install and adjust, well thought-out features, fair price!  Makes me want to have more kids just to buy more of these :

I think that this crib toy is awesome! Since my son was 3 months old we've turned it on every night at bedtime for him. He just watches the fishies swim around while the lights dance and the music plays. My son is now 7 months old and he still seems to like it.  And the cool thing is that now he is old enough to be able to interact with it.  If I switch it to manual MODE, he can turn on the music himself!  He can also play with the crackling feet and feel the silky material. Plus, he has another friend to keep him company in his crib (a big happy turtle with fish in his belly :-). Thus far, the straps haven't broken or cracked and I have removed it from the crib a couple of times. Also, the fish do swim around and the music does last for 15 minutes.  Its just a matter of which MODE you switch it to. (Reading the instructions really helps.) I strongly recommend this

I read some other reviews that were poor, but I disagree.  My son loves this toy.  He smiles when he sees the turtle from across his room.  It plays music continually for 12 minutes. So, in the middle of the night when he wakes up, I turn it on and he's asleep by the time it runs out.  We have moved it twice and the straps seemed sturdy.  However, it is recommended that this toy be removed when the child is 5 months old or is able to get on hands and knees. This completely contradicts the interactive play mode, since the baby needs to be both physically and mentally developed to a stage beyond 5 months to reach all the buttons.

I tried several different bottles with my daughter and these have worked wonderfully for us.  We actually came across them when Walmart stopped carrying the Parent's Choice Anti Colic bottles we had been using which are similar in design.

These bottles really seem to decrease the amount of air my daughter takes in while she's feeding.  This is a blessing as she has had problems with gas since birth.  She also has reflux.  I can't tell you if the bottles are a major factor in her improvement in that area because she is now on meds.  However, I have to think they've helped a bit.  They are also comfy to hold for me.

I've read a lot of reviews that talk about leaking.  I had this problem once and that was because I heated the bottle with the valve system in it.  So, I learned to not do so and have not had a problem since.

They are a bit pricy, but I believe that you get what you pay for.  

Lastly, I don't think that the small parts are difficult to wash.  Yes, it's a bit more time consuming if you don't have a dish washer, but for us, it's been well worth the extra time

We started with Dr. Brown's when my daughter was just three weeks old - she's now 10 months - and have loved them from the very beginning.  We've used them both for breastmilk and for formula, and they've been great for both.  We've never had trouble with gas and have had very few spitting-up episodes, and I give all the credit to the bottles.  They're comfortable for me to hold, light enough that even a young-ish baby can hold them on their own, and easy to fill.  The cleaning is a bit of a pain - more parts than in other brands of bottles - but it's worth it.  And we haven't found that Dr. Brown's leaks any more than any other brand.  Definitely give these a try - they're great

I purchased this despite the reviews I read, out of desperation!  But have been very happy with the fit on my Eddie Bauer Morgan Gingham playard bassinet.  It is a little thin, however, I use a Carter's mattress pad underneath anyway, so I am not concerned with absorbancy.  It does the job as a nice surface to lay my son's head on, and I purchased one more in Navy to switch out when it is laundry time

I have never seen any inflatable tubs quite like this and we are so pleased!  Our 8 month old daughter loves in the independence she can have in her own tub and we feel that she is much safer than in the big tub at this age.  We love how you can hang it up on the shower wall to dry.  Just make sure the suction cup is wet and it won't fall off the wall.  Sizewize, it's basically a perfect fit in our tub, which is slightly tapered from head to toe, but I could see how it would be snug if you have a small rectangular tub.

When I saw the pictures, I thought I could fit both kids. They fit, but with little room for two. No room for play.  I will purchase another one. Still a good product, safe and sturdy and easy to clean.

I've been searching for the perfect tub for my baby and I think I've found it!  We've been using a plastic reclined tub since he was born, but he has clearly outgrown it.  I tried one of those seat tubs(?), but he hated it and it seemed to scratch his legs ... TERRIBLE tub.  Thankfully I was able to return that one.  I found this one here on Amazon and reluctantly purchased it.  Glad I did!!  It allows a lot more freedom for him to explore and play (now that he can sit up unsupported).  Bath time has become much more fun ... for both mom & baby!

UPDATE : i first reviewed this after we purchased the item.  I've been using it for just over 1 month now and one of the seams has already torn.  I don't think i've used this item improperly to cause it to happen sooner than "expected".  Unfortunately, the patch-kit piece that came with the tub is significantly too small to patch it up completely.  Very unfortunate because we loved the tub.

New rating : 3 stars because of how quickly the seam tore

I was a bit nervous about buying these covers after reading the negative reviews, but I did it anyway, and I'm glad.  The covers are durable--the color hasn't faded, and it still fits perfectly over the changing pad.  I think they're soft enough for diaper changing--I wouldn't put my baby to sleep on it, but then, who would

This has been such a huge help with warming breastmilk, formula and now baby food jars. It heats the jars evenly and we have never had an issue with it. I wish this was around 12 years ago when we had our first child. I think that this is a very good investment, especially when you yourself have used a microwave and found that it doesn't heat ANYTHING evenly!!

After reading some of the reviews I felt compelled to share my experience with this product.  I love it!  I'm not sure if they made a different model before, but mine has an on/off switch that works just fine (its on the back).  Its not rocket science if you follow the directions.  I never have problems with the bottle floating.  If you put the bottle in first and then fill the warmer with water like the directions tell you to, then the bottle won't float.  The warmer itself has a chart on it that tells you how long to leave the bottle in the warmer and at what setting.  It also has a light that flashes on and off when the warmer has reached a constant temperature.  There are no "dings" or timers, but that hasn't presented any problems for me.  Overall this product does what it is supposed to do and it does it well.  As a first time mom, I highly recommend it.

I thought a fold-up tub was a great idea, but we've used this only maybe 10 times before my daughter turned 6 months, the maximum age of use.  I paid only $10, so not much loss.  She objected the first time we tried it, at about 2 weeks, and so we went back to sponge baths for a while.  I would suggest gradually introducing your baby to the tub.  Toys helped distract her when she was a little older.  My daughter seemed too big for it even at 3 months, though she was always 97%+ in height & weight.  To wash her backside, you of course have to take her out of the tub.  I usually forgot to plug it before filling it, and so usually had water all over the floor.  Instructions say tub is supposed to be supported by a sink; it certainly doesn't fit in our oval bath sink.  Maybe it would fit a 2-part kitchen sink.  The folding feature did make it easy to store on our closet shelf.  For a little tub bath, I liked it.  It was good for a quick bath or to really soak her, but in the end I prefered a unhurried sponge bath on a waterproof pad on the bed, which I think got my daughter cleaner

I have used many infant tubs and I love this one!  It folds so nicely I keep it in the kitchen pantry.  It fits in the sink, and I keep the faucet running like a little shower, and I can rinse her with fresh water.  I actually think the angle is great for an infant, but with a newborn I use one of those "yellow bear sponges" in the tub for extra support (but I use one with all the infant tubs I have used).

you don't need the whole kit. only the loop and latch is needed. if you use the plastic, it gets really heavy and you end up holding it anyway.  you just loop the rubber bands to the connector and then attach the tubing.  this way, you can use the softfit breastshield too

Well, I felt a little silly paying about $20 (with shipping) for 2 pieces of plastic, 2 bra hooks, and some rubber bands.  However, the kit does work, and does allow you to pump hands free.  One word of caution - if you use Medela's Quick Clean steam bags to clean your pump parts, TAKE THE HANDS FREE PLASTIC SLEEVES OFF before throwing the bag in the microwave!  Otherwise, they warp and don't fit right

This baby gate is great!!! the top of my stairs both walls going in 2 different angles and i am so glad that i found this gate! it works great and i havn't had any problams with it at all. I installed it as soon as i got it. and i didnt seem to have any problams installing it. I have a 2 yr old and all moms and dads out there know how 2 yr olds can be at trying out new things! it is a tall gate so he cant lean over it and fall. all the bars on it are vertical so he cant climb it. and the lock on it is easy to use but he cant unlock it. The gate is made out of metal and is welded together so you dont have to worry about the bars coming out like you do with the wooden gates. I highly recomend this gate for any room any doorway and its great at the top of the stairs

So far I haven't used much in this kit just because my son is only a month old and most the products are for older babies (also we haven't run into issues to need it) but I have used the nose aspirator and it's great.  It's soft and I don't fear hurting his nose!  I'm very excited to use the rest of the products

I bought the same brand, but maybe an newer/older version of this? It didn't have the book or the decogestant that is only for the older children that others have mentioned.  However, it DID have an Infant Tylenol equivelent, which we have been lucky enough to not have had to try yet.

The gas drops are fantastic - thank goodness we had these, especially when we had to change his formula!!  Anytime our son was "fussy for no reason" we tried these drops first and it stopped the fussiness almost every time.  The saline drops are great and the nose drops have really helped during his colds. The aspirator works fine, I've never tried a different one, so can't compare.  He didn't care about the teething toy, and doesn't care for the taste of the teething gel, but it seems to work.  It also has two cooling wipes which we haven't had to use (no fevers yet!).

Overall I was really glad to have this, and to have all these things together in a nice case I slid right under his changing table - no need to hunt for things in the middle of the night.  I'd recommend this to all new moms

I have bought this set for a gift, but also received it as a gift myself (from my registry).  Although my daughter is two and a half now, I would recommend the Playtex nursers to everyone!  They are sanitary and do cause less gas than conventional bottles.  I definitely like the Drop-Ins liners better than the traditional ones...  from a convenience standpoint, paired with the fact that they work so well with the breast milk storage system.

I'm not planning on any more children, but I don't dare part with these bottles yet.  They are stored in my basement for future use, either my myself or family members.  They also helped make the transition from breast to bottle to sippy cup a breeze

This is absolutely the best bottle on the market. After working in daycare and as a nanny, I had a preference for these.  Then after my sister had my nephew and used them I knew the minute I found out I was expecting that I would be using them too.  

The reason that I love these bottles so much is that they are very easy for baby to latch onto.  Most other bottles use very small nipples whereas these use a nipple that is quite large, more like a breast.  If you think about how a woman's body is made and really look at the nipples you will see what I mean.  Being able to latch on better allows them to eat better and have much less gas and spit up.

I also love how easy they are to warm up in a bottle warmer or crock pot.  Because they use the liner, the milk can heat up much quicker than a standard bottle with thick plastic - a very important thought at 3AM!!!

Some people think having to always by liners is costly an annoying.  But not really.  100 eight ounce liners will cost about $8 and will last about 2 to 2 1/2 weeks.  So not as bad as you might think.  (If this is truly an issue for you, consider the Advent bottles.  They also have relatively large nipples.  But because they do not use a liner, you cannot eliminate the air from the bottle and they take much longer to warm up.)

I'm the mother of a 3 1/2 month old baby girl. I had intended to only breastfeed for the first year, but it turned out that my daughter had a very difficult time at first with latching on. So much so that she ended up taking in very little milk and her weight dropped nearly a whole pound from her birth weight in the first week. The pediatrician told us we would have to supplement with formula to bring her weight up. I chose the Premium Nurser bottles because they said they were good for switching between breast and bottle feeding. My daughter took well to the bottles, and even started latching on better when I did breast feed. I'm continuing to use formula along with breastfeeding with no nipple confusion problems whatsoever. When people ask me if I breastfeed or bottlefeed my baby, I say "both", and they tell me how lucky I am! These bottles are a life-saver! They're easy to clean (I use the top rack of the dishwasher), and my baby hasn't had any problems with colic. I like the convenience of the disposable bags, too. And my daughter is now starting to "help" hold on to the bottle while I feed her. These are the best

This product was recently purchased for my 5 1/2 month old son's stroller by my mother-in-law & I love it. I had an older hand-me-down version for his infant carrier but the new ones are better. I love the fact that the new version has velcro so you can easily move it from car seat to stroller or from one stroller to another.I only wish it came in more colors & color combinations

I have been using the Graco Snugride since my son was about 2 months old - he's now five months old.  The seat and the base are both easy to install and the seat is easy to adjust and to carry.  As the product name suggests, my son fits snugly and comfortably into the seat.

The only problem that I have is with the process for adjusting the harness.  The buckles to do so are at the back of the seat and do not allow the harness straps to move easily.  I have found that I have to get behind the seat and really work at the straps and the buckles to adjust the seat properly, which is difficult to do if the seat and baby are already in the car.  Apart from that, the seat provides good value for the price

We got this seat in a different color for our first baby.  We feel very secure with it. Easy to install and a little hint, they try to get you to buy the second base for the snugride if you have two cars... you don't need it, you can fasten the seat without the base. the directions for it are on the seat. 
   I like that we can move the canopy to wherever the sun is to directly block it, and that it's transportable to our stroller. (bough seperatly) It comes with a head "brace" whatever those things are called to cradle the head. Those never do anything, and are pretty useless, but the seat itself is great.

My wife and I (yep a guy reviewing a kids toy!) bought this as a present for our 7 month old niece. She is absolutely hooked on it. Having a relatively short attention span with most toys, it was rewarding to see how much she likes it and how long it entertains her. Just squeezing the musical tentacles for her keeps her happy! The big doe eyes have her mesmerized as well. When she gets bored, learning to play tunes keeps the adults happy!! 

Playing is easy, you get two color coded tunes on the label and with the help of a musical friend we know a lot more now.

With my wife 4 months pregnant, we have ordered another already.

Only reason for 4 stars is the one we bought had trouble playing the lowest note (red tentacle!)

I did a lot of online and store researching before I bought this seat for my 3 1/2 year old son. My one concern was that my son is very slim and all the reviews talked about how the seat worked well for larger children. Well now I can say it works well for slim ones as well. He loves the arm rests and the cup holder. It is light weight and so easy to move and fold when necessary. We liked it so much we are going to buy  another one for when our 2 year son son is ready for that transition

My husband and I bought a second one after having had the first one for a little while for my 6 year old son.  He liked it so much that we bought another one for my almost 4 year old.  The seat is incredibly easy to clean (which is wonderful as the boys snack in the car a lot) and it's also so easy to fold and throw in the back of the car when we aren't using it.  Both boys feel very comfortable in it and seem to not mind riding in it for long periods of time.

I was told to get the diaper genie from many people but liked the looks and reviews of the diaper dekor so decided to put it on my registry. I am so glad I did. I have only had to empty it about every 6-7days and it is simple and odor free. Even when full there is no odor! I didnt need to put in a refill for 3months. the refills look pricey till you realize how long each one lasts. in comparison, its cheaper! I would recommend this to anyone

The Diaper Dekor is the best diaper pail on the market!  It's easy to operate and stays odor-free!  To get rid of a dirty diaper, just step on the foot pedal and drop the diaper in the pail.  Completely hands-free!  You don't have to worry about twisting anything like you do with the Diaper Genie.  When the pail is full, just pull out the bag, cut it loose on the door-mounted blade, and tie a knot in the top.  Then, just tie a knot in the liner that remains in the pail and you're all set for the next batch of dirty diapers!  The "continuous liner" concept is genius!  I've been using the Diaper Dekor since my daughter's birth ... and I'm still on the same refill that came with the pail.  I did, however, stock up on refills for the future by adding them to my baby registry! :-

I did plenty of research for a car seat for my firstborn, and the Snugfit got the best safety reviews.  And we just loved the pring- perfect for a boy or a girl.  I had heard how hard car seats were to install in the car, but it was a BREEZE.  I had it installed in the backseat within five minutes.  My car has the LATCH system, and it has worked great.  My daughter loves being in her car seat, and I have always felt perfectly safe with her in it.  I was surprised to read the other reviews, since I have never experienced a single one of those issues with my car seat.  I would highly recommend this seat to any parent

I got this toy when my baby was 7 months old, and he's now 8 1/2 months old.  We've used it for lots of local driving and a roundtrip from Los Angeles to Phoenix (7+ hours each way).  It doesn't work miracles, but it does definitely help calm and distract my baby when he starts to fuss, about 70%-80% of the time.  And I think it's more effective now than it was when we first got it, maybe because the baby has started to look forward to it. It might help that I *only* use it when he starts to fuss. 

I haven't had any problems with the toy working, and the volume dial is a nice feature. It does have its shortcomings, though, like some of the other reviewers pointed out: It only stays on for about 15 minutes (presumably to save batteries) so pretty much every time I put the baby in his carseat, I push the button to turn it on, just in case we need it during the drive.  It sometimes moves out of place which can affect being able to see the baby in the mirror, but it still works to distract him.  It plays 5 or 6 songs in random order, but they are all extremely short, so it ends up being very repetitive.  

Overall, I think it's a useful tool for calming the baby during car trips, and when it doesn't work it's generally because my baby is so tired or hungry that I don't think anything would really help except getting him out of the car.  And even though the repetitive songs can get annoying, it's far better than hearing a baby screaming while everyone is trapped in the car together

I bought this set for use with my second child. It helps to have more bottles around when she needed to go to daycare and I needed to pump. I use the bottles and different nipples to feed her and then use the bottles from this set to pump with. She did not take to the nipples that came with this set--but they are very nice and if she had it would have been perfect. The bottle hold 6 oz so once your baby is taking more than 6 oz you would not be able to use them to feed with. Overall---I am so happy with the Medela bottles and pump!!

A good choice for 2 sided protection after a comparison with 3 other bed rails

Due to the room layout, I needed a double bed rail that would protect both sides of the bed.  We don't live near a store that has a lot of choices and after reading many online product descriptions decided that we were going to need to look at several of these "in person" and then decide which one best fit our needs.  So we purchased 4 brands of bed rails.

After looking at the more detailed information on the box and trying two of them out, we decided to keep the Safe and Secure Double Bedrail by the First Years.

To help others, I have attached two customer's photos to this product description.  These photos are sketches and photos from the side of the box that better describe the bed rail.  Why amazon/Target can't get a least as much information on their website than is on the side of the box is frustrating to me.  But that seems to happen many times.  

This bedrail took about 30 minutes to assemble the side panels and another 45 minutes to fully assemble the unit to the bed.  This is in line with the time that the other model we tried out took.  

The reasons why we liked this bed rail the best are as follows:
(1)	It is a double bed rail and is designed to protect both sides of the bed.
(2)	This was the only model we looked at where both sides folded down making mattress pad and sheet changes feasible.  
(3)	The quality of the construction (especially of the spring loaded Locking Pins) was much better than that of the Sleeptite bed rail we looked at from Regalo and One Step Ahead (which is also made by Regalo.)
(4)	The design made more sense than the Regalo.   The installation was more straightforward.  

Possible issues with this bed rail are as follows:
(1)	It is only 17" high, so measure your mattress and make sure that it will fit.  In our case, our mattress was not a pillowtop and is about 10-11" high, depending on where you measure it.  So we were still satisfied with the height of the rail above our mattress.   But I could see where if you had a tall mattress this would be an issue.
(2)	This was the easiest rail to pull up to unlock and fold down.   Others had more substantial locking mechanisms.   I could see where a toddler who watched you do this, could then do it himself.  So we are planning on not doing this in front of our toddler, only during sheet changes.   Only you know how inquisitive your own child is about these things and how much of a problem this would be.  

Despite these two issues, we decided that the good points outweighed the bad and that this bedrail was the best choice for us.  However, if we are later disappointed with this bed rail, I will go and update our review.

I just bought these and my daughter looks adorable.  The first time I put them on she got a little fussy until she realized she could see through them.

The shades come with two straps, one small and one large.  My daughter is four months old and the smaller strap barely fits but the larger one is still a little big.  The velcro on either side of the smaller strap is just barely attached and fits comfortably only if around the bottom of her head.  In this position, her ears are a little pushed down but as the strap is soft it's not a big deal.  If straight around her head, the shades are too tight and squish the area around her eyes.  Even if adjusted as small as possible, the large strap is still a little too big.  It should fit in another month I think.

I own this blanket and just bought another! I brought this blanket to my playgroup at the park. It was perfect on the damp grass and big enough for me, my daughter, and all of our stuff. A few of the other moms liked it so much they bought it too. My baby spits up quite a bit, especially during tummy time, so I decided to buy another one to use in the house. It cleans so easily with a baby wipe or a damp cloth. Great investment

I purchased this wonderful blanket for my baby.  My plan was to carry it along with me whenever I would visit family and friends at their homes.  I could then lay my baby down or interact with my child on a clean surface.  The blanket is 16.0 x 4.0 x 11.0 inches, which will accommodate adults well.  I was pleased when I received the blanket to have discovered the excellent craftsmanship that was put into the creation of the piece.  The quality is absolutely top notch!  The surface material also seems like it could be easily cleaned if a spill should occur.  The only slight con I have of the Essentials blanket is that it is a bit on the heavy side.  This is only a negative if one is expecting to carry it for a long period of time.  Otherwise I adore this blanket and highly recommend it

This is our third baby monitor.  The first two had static if you would plug anything into the same outlet or get them near other electronic devices.  This one has worked flawlessly in our home w/ zero static.  The talkback feature is also wonderful for a three year old ("Go back to sleep," "I'll get you juice in the morning," etc.)  Not having to get up and go to the child's room is a real feature.

The only reason I gave it four stars is because it only has two channels and because the signals aren't encrypted.  Anyone else with an FM receiver can pick up your conversations, but most monitors are this way.   We took the monitor to a friend's house and it picked up a lot of static/interference from something in the house (Video monitor, TV, I don't know.)  Since it only had two channels, we were not able to find a clear channel. 

Overall thoughts: Best monitor I've had (Stay away from the Fisherprice models).  I would buy again unless I was in an apartment complex (I wouldn't want other people listening in), and I would be prepared to take it back if I needed more channels

I was debating between this analog model and digital models. I have never heard the digital models to be honest. But this analog model has been great. I can hear minor changes in my daughters breathing and talk to her over it to "buy time" when I am busy and can't get to her immediately. I have had none of the problems with noise and interference some have complained about. If your family is on a tight budget like mine, this is in the best bang for the buck out there today

I have used several monitors in the past 7 years and chose this one due to the walkie-talkie feature.  It works well and has a great range.  The vibration is a nice feature so that you can turn down the sound when you have company and are having a conversation; no one else has to hear your little ones settling down for their sleep

My baby and I just LOVE IT!!!! It is so easy to bath her now and SO MUCH FUN! I started bathing her everyday in this bathtub and it is just awesome. She plays with her toys and has tons of fun. The side where her head rests is lifted so she can safely lay down and relax. After her bath, I just empty the tub and hang it in a knob in our bathroom until the next day. I really recommend it, it is super practical.(Please never leave your baby unattended

I love this product. I have 5 month old twins that were born 6 weeks early. I swaddled them in receiving blankets when they came home from the NICU and they loved sleeping that way. I stopped swaddling them at 2 months because I could see they no longer liked it. My night nurse told me to continue to swaddle them at night for up to a year. She said it would help them sleep through the night. I bought this product and while my girl and boy twins didn't like it at first they do go to sleep faster and stay asleep longer when they are wearing them. Not long after I started using this product my son slept from 7 to 7. What a dream! He is getting better at getting at least one arm out but even when he does he still sleeps better then when he is not swaddled at all. I have found that it works better when I put them in it when they are drowsy because then they don't lay in their crib trying to get out of it before they fall asleep. We don't use them during the day now. I will always give this as a baby gift going forward

As very frequent (often long-distance) travelers, we routinely purchase airline tickets for our daughter so that she can travel safely and comfortably in her car seat on plane trips.  We really pushed the size limits of the car seat that integrated into a stroller (the Graco travel system) for ease of use, but once she had finally made the dreaded transition into a larger seat, we tried practically every method for moving the seat, toddler, diaper bag, collapsible stroller, carry-on, etc., from our home to and through the airport without ending up completely exhausted and frustrated.    Of all of the options that we tried, the Pac Back was the most consistently comfortable and convenient.  I'm not very tall (5'5"), and find that I can manage to wear the Pac Back, stow loose and light objects (such as coats or stuffed animals) in the car seat itself, sling a diaper bag over one shoulder and a purse on the other, and still have enough mobility/agility to bend down and pick my daughter up or hold her hand.  (Granted, I look like a Pac Animal, but that's a small price to pay for having free hands at key moments.)  The  strap system is intuitive to use and seems well-constructed.  Compared to a car seat bag, the Pac Back is much more easily removed from the car seat once on the plane, and I have never had any trouble replacing the straps in a minute or two -- plenty of time to have the seat on my back by the time people start exiting the plane.  The straps adjust easily enough that my taller husband and I can take turns carrying the seat when we travel together without spending a lot of time situating ourselves.  The only drawbacks: you really have to pay attention while wearing what amounts to a giant rigid backpack that you don't bash someone or something while turning, and the straps may have to be removed to go through security IF the x-ray machine has an extremely small opening (only happened once or twice at regional airports).  Overall, an amazingly simple but incredibly helpful product.

We have had this puzzle toy since my son was one. (He's 3 now.) It has provided hours of entertainment and education.  We started by just showing him a few choices and matching, now he can easily do the whole box himself, and enjoys it.  I like the textures, vibrant colors and nice large sturdy pieces.  The nice sturdy box to hold them is great too.

When my daughter was born, I didn't know about swaddling, and it would take me HOURS to get her to sleep! I would feed or rock her in my arms until she falls asleep, then put her in her crib... and she'd flail her arms, wake up and cry, and I had to start all over! What a nightmare! 

Then I figured out that since her arms wake her, it would make sense to wrap her in something so she couldn't move them as much... so I started wrapping her in regular receiving blankets. It worked! It became much easier to get her to sleep. But then she wiggled out of those receiving blankets and wake up again. 

When she was a little over a month old, somehow I came across SwaddleMe blankets on the Internet and immediately bought it. It worked great! It was so easy to wrap my daughter in it, and it stayed put. My daughter started sleeping so much better! 

I wish I found those blankets sooner - it would've saved me from so many sleepless nights! 

2 years later, my son was born, and thankfully I already knew about those blankets from the start. He goes to sleep great in the SwaddleMe blanket! Out of curiosity, I tried to put him to sleep without this blanket, and his arms wake him right away - exactly the same as my daughter! 

I consider this blanket one of the most important baby items you could buy. It should be a must for a new mother who wants to get some sleep

I love this Item.  It was a life saver.  At around 4-6 weeks, my baby would only sleep if held or laying on his side next to me after breastfeeding.  Since it's impossible to hold a baby all night and laying next to me on his side was a "No, No" for SIDS, I was looking for something that could help me get him to sleep in his bassinet on his back as is suggested to prevent SIDS.  I had tried swaddling my baby in blankets, but after a few weeks he had figured out how to get out of it.  I also didn't like that he could undo the blanket and it was loose around his face, another "no, no" for SIDS. So I bought these swaddle Me blankets that fasten easily with velcro.  And shortly after we started using the Swaddle me's, he started sleeping through the night, occasionally waking up for a 15 minute feeding (which I keep him swaddled for) and then he falls right back to sleep and I carefully pick him up and put him back in the bassinett for the rest of the night.  He's 4 months old now and we're still using them.... Buy a few, because if we wets himself, which boys do a lot, you'll need another one to switch him into

We love the swaddle me blankets.  We have the flannel and the fleece.  This has helped us with getting our daughter to sleep through the night (in just two weeks of using them).   She loves to be swaddled but is very strong and would wiggle out and then wake up and need to be swaddled again.  With the velcro she is less able to get out of the swaddle and feels safe and secure and sleeps longer.

The fleece has a little more stretch to it and is easier to use but the flannel is a little lighter weight for the summer so not to overheat.  Have not tried the cotton ones.

Definitely worth a try

HI this is the 5th gate we have had on the top of our stairs. Some were difficult to open when you are also holding a child. Some were so noisy you could never slip down stairs while baby was sleeping and others simply felt like a strong sneeze would topple them over. This one is great I love the fact that the lock is difficult enough that a 4 year has trouble but not difficult enough that grandma has trouble!

I love this shade! I am the mother of 2 girls, Alice 7 and Samantha 22 months. I never had anything like this for my oldest. It makes such a difference. The little one won't go out without it! Even though I always used Sunblock on Alice, her skin is still so much darker than Samantha's; I really believe it is because of the shade. I looked into a lot of other brands before choosing this one and I think it is the best one on the market. The others are made from Nylon/Lycra and I don't think that would hold up as well as this one does. Thank you Protect a bub

We looked at a lot of different baby gyms and this is by far the best we've found.  I love that the arcs are easy to put up and take down, it stores flat, and that you can add as many toys as you want.  Our baby has really enjoyed it.  There is plenty of room to roll around and we can set baby in at all different angles so it can be like a new toy every time

My little guy loved this from the start.  This is a versatile toy that lasted many months.  The mat is machine washable, so it became our take along for travel.  The hanging toys are on rings that detach so you can rearrange them for variety and take them anywhere, such as on the car seat or stroller as baby grows.  He's now 2 yrs, and the mat is still a wall hanging in his room!  This was a great investment

I love this carrier (I bought it in Feb 2007). My daughter loves it too. She can sleep very well in it. The only problem is it can only hold up to 22lb, while mine is already 17lb (she is only 3 months). I guess I don't have too much time to use it. If this company could develop a one which suits for big baby, I will definitely buy it.

I had no idea that the Bjorn was so expensive, since I got it as a gift at my Baby Shower.  But knowing what I know now, Id definately spend the cash since its been such a blessing to have it.

My baby had reflux really bad when she was born and alot of the times, the only way to help her feel comfortable was to have her in the Bjorn facing me so that she could fall asleep.  (She needed to be upright or inclined to help her not to spit up so much)  Being that it was so used, Im super glad that its easy to put on and take off.  The durability of it is awesome also and I still dont see any wear and tear on it after almost daily use. 

Now that my baby is getting older, I switch her forward and she loves that.  She can see everything and grab at whatever is in front of her.  The ease of the clips is a godsend, so that I can clip her in quickly and without the need for someone to assist me.

I tried some other carriers, but all the straps and clips were so confusing.  Plus alot of the others arent reversible.  You can only have your baby face inwards.  

This is totally worth the money guys!

This is my second superyard. The first one I bought many years ago when the superyard was made with protruding metal hinges which were somewhat hazardous and invited mouthing by little teethers. Aside from being a little stiff to fold (which might be because it is new) this model is a vast improvment over the old. It's a couple of inches taller and seems sturdier. Great for blocking off the Christmas tree or any other part of the house. Cruising babies love to go round and round the inside and you can hang a busy box or other toys on the side to amuse a crawling baby. 
During football season, my friends and I take our superyards to tailgate and join them together to make a super superyard, so all the toddlers can safely play together. It's easy to clean using the pressure nozzle on the hose outdoors. Minor drawback is that it can be scooted across the floor or climbed out of by a determined toddler. Do I really need to say that any play yard should always be used only under adult supervision? Final comment - one of the most useful pieces of child-care equipment I've 
ever owned. The only reason I gave it 4 stars insteat of 5 is because my experiences with North States' customer service has been poor

The Superyard was a fantastic buy for us consider that it has allowed us time to have dinner together in a marginal civilized fashion.  Our 9 months old loves to play in it specially since she can see us through it.  You can hook a bunch of toys to it to keep your child entertained.

This play yard is the greatest thing to happen to new mothers, espicially ones that garden, since the invention of disposable diapers! I bought two and an extension panel, which make for an ample size playpen. Inside, I put a Little Tikes climber, a Step One ladybug sandbox filled with pea gravel, and a Playskool Grow-With-Me picnic table, and he still has plenty of room to romp. I can garden without having to pull him out of the fish pond or retrieve him from a newly planted bed of tulips.

I will say up front that I use the gate at the bottom of the stairs and not at the top as the product suggests.  The gate is built well...simple and functional.  It has the optional ability to restrict the direction of movment and the hinges give a great angle of movment and detach easily.  It went up easy and works as designed.  It is just a tiny bit awkward to reach for the latch to release and pull back the gate but this is a very minor issue.  In a similar vien, you have to line up the bottom rail at the same time you line up the top rail in order to close.  My guess is that it would be less awkward if used at the top of the stairs as recommended.  Overall I would recommend the gate for both locations on the stairs

The gate works perfectly.  However, it doesn't get 5 stars because the installation instructions are not very intuitive.  I am very handy with tools, remodeling, etc. and I found the installation to take longer than I would have expected.  The latch receptacles are different sizes and the smaller one goes at the top.  There was a "U" stamped in it, but no mention of that in the instructions.  Nor did the instructions mention the size difference and that the bigger one goes on the bottom.  How hard would that be?  One sentence?  I went through a dry run and figured it all out, but it doubled the installation time (took +/- 1 hour)

I have been canvasing the internet for some type of guard to cover the hearth in our family room.  I have read countless reviews of the "double faced tape foam pads" that come off right away with little effort.
This product attached exactly as described.  I had the unit installed as well as the pads measured, cut and installed in 10 minutes.  The taupe color is very discrete on our cream, red & black brick fireplace.  I can't see how my three little ones would ever get this off even if they tried.  Great product and gives me the feeling of comfort that if someone falls and hits there head that the chance of sticthes has been greatly reduced.  An absolute must for your hearth.

I love this stroller, and tell all of my friends about it. Our daughter was about 3 months old when I purchased it. 
There was not a better rated stroller available when I researched, and there still is not. You can run, walk or rollerblade behind this stroller and feel confident that your child is safe. Lilyana is now 4 1/2 months and loves going for our daily walks, and occasional rollerblading.
She is a fussy girl, (only) when it comes to being strapped down in the carseat, but loves the comfort and hammock like feel of BOB. 
We live in Florida, and with the sun-guard canopy, she is well covered.
Some other factors which made we chose BOB:
* The braking mechanism, which is hard to find, has a wrist strap which if you should fall, locks the back wheels (unlike most strollers on the market). This feature is great for rollerbladers.
* 5 point safety harness
* 70 pound weight limit (highest that I found)
* Metal frame (others have more plastic that metal)
* Shock absorbers, great of rocking/bouncing her to sleep
* Swivel front wheel, which locks with a simple pin.
* Simple Lily likes it, and we tried several others, all that Babies-R-Us has in stock.

The cost is pretty high, but would you put a price on the safety of your child, if you were to fall while exercising?

Thanks for hearing me out

We bought this swing for our 11 month old daughter, and she loves it!  We attached it to our back porch easily enough, and she swings in it every day!  We've had it for about a month and it is still her favorite toy!  
The only issue that we have had is that it hangs slightly crooked because of the way that they put the hooks on the swing at the factory.  The aren't both facing the same direction, which is something that we cant fix, but it isn't bad enough to not use the swing or to cause any problems.  Its more irritating than anything.  Also, the swing seems secure and safe.  We've not had any issues with safety, or even any close calls

This is a great sterilizer, it's chamber is big enough to holder 4 to 5 bottles wide neck bottles and the tray can hold quite a few nipples and cap rings.  I bought it when my son was born and after a year, I'm still using it.  It works great, saves time, and has an auto shut-off function when the steaming cycle is complete.

My daughter is just learning how to self-feed and these placemats are great.  I've always been weary of those restaurant tables and how clean the cloths they use to wipe them are.  This product solves that problem.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because sometimes the corner does come off.  However, I do NOT find this to be a major problem.  Also, I tried the tip from other moms who fold the bottom half over the edge of the table.  Great tip.  Thanks.  This is a great product for kids learning to eat

Now that I've caved to the power of pink (it only took three girls for me to finally give in), this turns out to be very cute and was the second cheapest I could find.  Quality seems fine (two weeks post purchase) and who doesn't love a tool that keeps the kiddo safe and calm while one does dishes or makes dinner for the rest of the brood...?  For the first babe, we were given a different seat that aimed to be an improvement over the classic and very simple bouncy seat, but had so many functions it was basically useless.  This is a case, though, where the basics are the best.  In looking around for a new one, saw many for $100; if you can stomach the not-as-posh aesthetic, this seems like a great value for a seat that will only used for a few months, anyway

We have gone through a few packages of the Table Toppers and we love them!  Our toddler went from trying to peel them off the table to helping us stick them down....she loves to pull the paper strips off the adhesive....and she doesn't try to pull the mat off the table until she is finished eating.  We finally found the Shopper Toppers at Toys R Us and I was so excited I bought two packages....and they don't work worth anything!  The adhesive on those is down the sides, not across the top where it should be, to stick on the shopping cart handle....In fact we've decided that the Table Toppers will work better on the shopping cart than the ones made for the shopping cart.  Also, with only a Shopper Topper in our bag while out for lunch recently, we used it on the table and it worked just as well at the ones made for the table!  Well done

We have been using these ever since our baby could feed herself and she's almost 2 now.  We keep them in the trunk of the car along with a box of "pocket bibsters."  Whenever we eat out at a restaurant, we stick this down at our toddler's place.  She sits in her chair and eats with us and if any food spills off of her plate, it spills onto this nice clean mat.  The mat also has entertainment value, as she can name the items on it.  After she's made her mess, we just peel the mat off, wad it up, and throw it away

I loved this product.  My baby slept in it until she was able to turn over.  She resisted swaddling, and this was a good way for us to keep her feeling secure in the crib.  I agree with the other reviewer that you must be careful, particularly with tiny babies to position the velcro sides correctly so baby will not wiggle down.

This is a great wipes warmer for use with cloth wipes if you are cloth diapering.  The wipes are nice and warm and don't dry out.  I have seen no rust like one of the other reviews said.  Nightlight is also very nice and gives just enough light to see in the middle of the night.  I change out the wipes every 3-4 days and have had no problems with mildew.

This mobile is amazing. From the time she was 6 weeks old, my daughter was mesmerized by the motion and the music. She loves watching the animals and can be left in her crib for up to 45 minutes simply glued to the mobile. Although it can be noisy, it doesn't seem to bother her and she often falls asleep at night to the sights and sounds. A MUST for any nursery

Play Table is sturdy and colorful and my grandson (18 months) loves it.  It is good for small children - better than just table and chairs which tend to tip over. I wish it were a little bigger but it will fit 4 smalls or 2 larger children nicely

The bundleme is a must for any mom. It works so well! It really does eliminate the need for coats or even jackets. The first time I used it I thought my daughter might get a little chilly on the top half so I put a jacket on her. As soon as I was indoors and took her out of the bundleme I saw that she was too warm. She was actually sweating. Ever since then I use it without anything else and she stays very warm and cozy. We have lots of snow and cold winters where I live and the bundleme original was perfect. No more fussing with a blanket that gets kicked off the moment your baby is in the back seat of the car. The top piece also has the option to zip all the way off so if it's the only part that needs washed you don't have to take the straps out of the bottom piece. You can also unzip both sides to keep from over heating your baby if you'll be indoors for a short period of time. I think that every mom should have one and I would definitely buy one again

Don't bother with bulky snowsuits.  This makes it so easy for us to get out of the house with baby.  We live in the north east, so it is a life saver.  Yummy snuggly

I had this for my daughter when she fit into the baby carrier car seat.  It was awesome.  I never had to worry about blankets falling off or if she was warm enough.  They did tell me at the hospital, however, that if you put anything between your baby and the car seat it voids the warranty on the car seat.  This goes underneath them so it probably does, but I figured it was probably safer than putting a blanket over her anyway

I got this hat because it matched the JJ Cole Bundle Me blanket for my son's car seat. He looks absolutely adorable in it, but he hates wearing it unfortunately. The elastic is a little bit tight and it smooshes his whole forehead down. Overall, if your baby is a hat-wearer and this fits him/her, then it's wonderful. It's warm, soft and is made very well

I am a mom of three kids and this is by far the best Pack-n-Play on the market.  When #3 came along we needed to purchase a new Pack-n-Play.  The Graco Pack N Play with bug toys is absolutely the best we've ever owned.  The bright colors and cute toys make it a fun environment for our 8 month old.  She has loved the bright play mat since about 6 months, but now that she is sitting up she enjoys looking in the mirror and pulling on the rattle butterfly wings.  She actually gets excited about playing in her Pack N Play... and mom can get dinner cooked without interruption!

And, best of all, it is so much bigger than the other Pack N Plays.  There is plenty of room for her to play without rolling over the top of her toys.  The set up and take down is super easy... all four sides break-down very easily and it folds nicely without any hassle.  I am also a fan of the much thicker play mat that fits into the floor of the Pack N Play.  I never worried about her hurting herself if she plopped over when first learning to sit up.

Overall, I can't say enough WONDERFUL things about this product!  I'd put it on the new parent's "must have" list for sure

I had a hard time finding a play pen for my Grand daughter. There are many Pack N Play items but I wanted a larger square playpen like they made years ago. This one was exactly what I wanted. She has room to roll around and play with toys and it's easy to set up and take down

We bought this stroller for my daughters: 4.5 years/38 pounds/42 inches and 2 years/26 pounds.  We were in the market for a new stroller because one of the wheels on our old double stroller had broken off twice and was about to break off again.  I was looking for a stroller that wouldn't make my older daughter feel like "a baby," but gave her the option of sitting during long trips to the mall, zoo, park, etc.  This stroller was the answer!
The front seat is perfect for our little one.  The tray swings open (and comes completely off, if needed) to get her in and out easily.  I was able to unhook some of the belts and stuff them behind the cushion of her seat because I didn't think a 5-point harness was necessary.  The tray is large and sturdy, as is the foot rest.
My older daughter is technically taller than the guidelines, but we have absolutely no problem because of it.  She walks with us and then easily climbs onto her seat when she wants to take a break.
The parent tray is great and something I really missed on our last double stroller.  We can store keys, snacks, cellphone, etc., plus two cups/bottles.  The basket underneath is a good size and very easy to access.  The side of the basket is elastic and pulls down nicely and even unsnaps if need be.
The stroller folds and unfolds extremely easily.  It takes very little room to store.  The steering is fantastic and it requires very little effort to push.
The stroller also comes with a contraption to fit an infant carrier for families with a newborn/infant.
The price is fantastic too.  You can't beat $120 for a double stroller like this!
I wish we had bought this a year ago

This product is great. It is a little hard to turn when both kids are in it.  But I found if you hold it on the outside of the cup holders instead of on the hand grips turning is easier.  Makes my life a lot easier with my 1 and 3 year old

I have no idea how our parents had us with out these!  They are the best invention!  My son likes to play with plates, so I can feed him anything he wants on the table directly with out worrying about what else he may be eating.  I have a toddler and a 9 mo old.  NEITHER of them have been able to remove these things.  And beleive me, they've tried.  So I dont know what that other review was talking about.  They're inexpensive, easy to use, and clean.

I recently purchased this monitor when my old Fisher Price 49 MHz Sounds 'n Lights monitor stopped working in one of my twins room after only a year.  I could hear my next door neighbor but not my baby upstairs.  I figured this one has many channels to choose from so the chances of that happening where slim.  

Well... It works and I enjoy this monitor so much better that I am considering replacing my other Fisher Price one.  With this monitor I do not hear any noise from it unless my child is making noise.  My other one makes a low static sound all the time, it is not bother some but I can still hear it.  I would highly recommend this model. The price is great and I have not tried the rechargeable batteries yet but it is nice to know that I can take it off charge at any time and not have to worry about finding new batteries.  

A great find, a great buy, a great product

My husband and I just had a wonderful baby girl (Apr. 9, 2007) and I simply could NOT live without this item. My daughter loves sleeping in it. 

It is light; therefore, it can be easily moved from one room to another, as needed. You could easily travel with it.... from hotels to the "Grandparents house." It can be folded compactly and easily stored; and, there is also a handle for carrying. The light at the top is excellent for those who wish to co-sleep as well.  ***Obviously, do not leave your child unsupervised in it!**  

It is excellent and I highly recommend it to ALL parents

This is the single best new baby item that I purchased!!  I was a mom who swore that "my baby will never sleep in my bed".  Needless to say that didn't last 3 nights.  I got this co sleeper and it was just perfect.  Felt much more secure with him in there.  Very portable too, I took it everywhere for the first three months

like many new parents, I had lots of plans including my newborn sleeping by himself in a charming bassinet and later a crib... WELL... upon his arrival, my son showed us that he slept better between my husband and I for the first 6 weeks, plus he helped my husband and I sleep better not having to get up at every new and strange sound he made (for a new parent all the sounds are scary).  we just lifted our heads and knew he was fine, and went back to sleep.  Yes, it was a bit tight in a queen size bed, but most importantly, he was safe and we did not have to get up.  We used in bed until 6 weeks old, and then used it to transition him to his crib for the next 2 weeks.  overall, well worth it, plus easy to transport if need to spend the night at someone elses house during the first 2-3 months

My boys spend more time trying to play with this potty then trying to use it. It's fun and it's a miniature size adult potty. They love it. The seat is a little on the smaller side so one of my two year olds is outgrowing it already, but we are making it work. We have had other potties where the seat is a little bigger

This gate is easy to install and simple to operate once you get the hang of how it works.  My son is one and half years old and has a tendency to rush gates (he's broken two already...)  and so far, this one's holding up.  I would not recommend anyone use it at the top of stairs because it doesn't have an installation kit, but for hallways and at the bottom of the stairs it works really well.  It swings closed on its own and is pretty loud if you let it slam shut...  we use ours in the kitchen so it doesn't wake the babies up- however, if you were to use it in a hallway near where your kids are sleeping, it might be loud enough to disturb their sleep.

All in all, it's a really good deal and I would highly recommend this product

I love this gate one because of the height. It is high enough to even keep my three year old out of trouble.  I also like that I can operate the Gate with only one hand.  That is great because like other Mom's my hands are often busy with something else.  I would and have reccommended this product to anyone who is looking for a gate

I purchased this sling from ebay for $8 and expected to use it to carry my newborn with one arm free and then be done with it, we did just that.  It has been sitting in my get rid of pile now for 8 months and then SURPRISE today I found a website that shows you how to get so much more out of this product, and after reading the instructions on the site and SEEING photos of how to do it, I now COMFORTABLY, have my son HANDS FREE in the sling with a hip straddle position and he is totally secure.  I am petite and this is one size fits all, you CAN pull the sling through the rings more than just the tail to make it tighter.  If you have problems with the baby being secure, you just need to pull up the material high on the back (theirs and yours) AND tuck it between their legs too - see the site for photos to better understand.  I am now VERY impressed with this product, a little knowledge goes a long way!  The site is polarbearcreations dot com slash pages slash howtouse dot php  ~ once you see how to use this product correctly, you WILL LOVE IT!  :o)  I do now

I absolutely love this walker. The songs it plays and the lights that flash really keep a baby entertained. I also love the ease of collasping it down so that it can be stored away somewhere. There are also great safety features such as the "grip strips" on the bottom. The wheels are very easily manuevered also. I would definitely recommend this product to other moms

My sister who has 4 kids insisted I buy this and boy was she right!  Those of you who say it takes time to snap it on and off aren't thinking about what you have to do to change the crib sheet.  First of all, the bumper has to be removed just to get to the mattress in any reasonable fashion and that's a pain to tie on and off.  Especially when you get it on there just right.  Then you have to lift up the mattress to get to the sheet bottom and pull it over the corners.  Did I mention that moving the mattress causes that cute little dust ruffle to get out of poistion?  Ugh, I don't think so.

I'd much rather deal with a few straps and snaps then have  my daughter sit on a soaking sheet (this pad wicks away the moisutre) and have to go through so much trouble to change it.

As far as the "imprint" on her face, I haven't noticed any and she hasn't been bothered

We have twins and these mattress pads are much more convenient than trying to wrestle with getting new sheets on the cribs in the middle of the night.  They are holding up well through frequent washings and are easy to attach.  I gave it 4 stars because it's not extremely soft, though it isn't bad.  I also like that the top layer is breathable - gives me peace of mind

I was looking for something for my darling 1 year old daughter to enjoy in the bathtub.  She loves this toy and helps her with developing her gross and fine motor skills.  The only down side is that the crayons get a bit "mushy" after a bit of time in the water.  But it the Baby Einstein crayons are a good replacement...which are inexpensive as well.  I look forward to many "Van Gogh"s from her.

I am not one of those parents who have trouble getting my child in the bath, its getting him out that's the problem.  With the crayons he absolutely loves coloring on the walls in the tub the pallet was useless when he figured out that the tub was just one huge canvas.

Personally I think these are some of the best tub toys!  My suggestion is to just buy the crayons and forget the pallet.  You can also use them in the pool and if you have a vinyl siding house and your children have sprinkler, it also makes a great place to color.  Be careful to wash everything off before it dries.

My two year old thinks this toy is the best thing in the world. It's so easy to get him to take a bath now!  The crayons are great and come off the tub easily...I give him a hand towel in the tub and he wipes the desk and tub off. The compartment to  keep the crayons in is good but a little difficult for my son to open.  Thank you for making this!

But, there are 2 things I don't like. One being that the toys hanging from the bar are too low. My sons knees hit it and he is only 6 weeks old. Second being that the continuous play songs, don't actually continually play. It actually pauses for about 1-2 minutes. My son will fall asleep to the music, then it pauses and starts up again, waking him. i do love the vibration feature, which is the main reason i bought it. All in all, it is worth it

When my son was born in May I tried the Dr Brown's bottles based on a co-worker's recommendation, and I am so glad I did!  My kids are all primarily breastfed, but for times when I need a bottle, Dr. Brown's are now the only ones I will use. My son is almost 4 months old now, and has had very little gas, and has never had any problems with colic! I wish I had had these bottles when my other children were babies.

As for those whining about the extra parts to clean.. Puh-leeze! I hand-wash all my baby's bottles anyway, but did you know these bottles also include an extra thin bottle brush to clean the straws with?? Dr. Brown's makes it as easy on the parents as possible, but who doesn't take the extra time to make sure their baby has the best? With the little brush to use on the straw and vents, it really takes no time at all, so stop the nonsense. Anyone who is even halfway considering trying these bottles really should pick up ONE at least, but I know you will go out and get more if you do

We love it!

Yes, the volume is low, but there's a very simple solution to that -- put it near your head.

The best things about this device are the AC adapter and the fact that it will run all night. I just leave it plugged in and turned on all the time (Our cat must think we live by the ocean now!)

A couple of reviewers said their machines stopped working and would only play for 5 seconds. If this happens to you, turn it over and flip the switch off of DEMO mode -- it has the 5-second setting so you can try it out in the store. 

We're hooked on this thing now. I may have to buy another one someday when my son moves into his own room.

I was worried this looked cheap, and too sterile and hospital-like for my new baby, but it is much more attractive in person. Safetly 1st needs to have a new photo taken of this crib, theirs looks dated. It arrived and took less than five minutes to assemble, by myself at 8 months pregnant! Completely assembled except for sliding the four leg castors into place and lifting the bars to an open position. Click- Done! Has two adjustable height settings, and comes with a nice mattress. I would not order another one. This is very soft and suitable. This rolls easily and the pack and play bedding fits it perfectly. The Eddie Bauer sheets from Target come in a fleece fabric that is extremely soft, love it! My crib skirt from a large crib fits with adjustments and I love the way it turned out. In fact I can't believe this is one of the cheapest alternatives, since I would say it is nicer than the wooden mini-cribs I saw in person at a local store. 

I have a 24 month old and I did not want two cribs, but I also did not want to rush her into a toddler bed. We bought one, but she doesn't want to stay in it at night. She feels safe and sleeps well in her crib. 

This crib is stable and will be fine for our second child until the older baby is out of her crib. This is a great product and very reasonable too!

This product definitely saves space but I've had a hard time cleaning the tray. Yes, it's dishwasher safe but it takes up so much room in our diswasher that I end up hand-washing it. There are so many little nooks on the underside of the tray that I'm always finding places that I misseed washing. Trust me, the baby will manage to get food there too! 

This product would be greatly improved if there were a smaller tray insert that popped out for washing (I've seen this on some highchair models).

Being that we had our baby in December, this was a godsend. Instead of having to bundle her up in heavy clothes thus making it a pain in the neck to strap her into the carseat, my wife or I would just clothe the baby normally and not even have to wory about a bulky jacket. Works great

I bought this for my twin girls and i love it. I had them in September and they fit it in all winter. It was so much easier to get the girls out to the car then using winter suits and trying to get twins to wear them or even put them on without screaming. Using this i was able to just dress them in something less constricting and put them in their car seats before they gave me any hassle. Once you're in the car and warm enough, all you have to do is unzip the sides and there's no fuss

Absolutely LOVE this product!!  Wish I had had one for my other 3 children.  We live in cold and windy North Dakota and this is just so easy to use.  There have been times my little one has gotten too hot when I over bundle him in it.  I recommend this to any one expecting a little one in the winter months.

We got two Bundlemes for our twin infant sons. The product handles, wears and washes well. This product is great for taking your infant for outdoor walks or for very cold climates. The only problem we have come across: on not so cold winter days the boys often become sweaty and uncomfortable in their car seats during my 30 minute commute

This is so much better than the Bjorn carrier.  You can wear it on the hip or in front.  It is very comfortable.  My baby always felt secure and I never thought he would come out.  I could wear my 25 pound baby for 2 hours without a problem.  My back and shoulders were never sore. Easy to put on.  Great way to calm a fussy baby!  Reversible black for men too

I LOVE this pillow. I've had it for about two and a half months now. At first it helped me stay on my side, and was just comfy to snuggle up to. Now that my belly is getting bigger, it gives great support and doesn't let my belly "hang" down. This is great for people who don't always sleep on their sides as once you position it you are unlikely to roll over in your sleep. I've had no problem with the stuffing. If you are looking for super firm support, try a wedge. This is a pillow, and feels as such. Of course, if you are on a budget, you can always just use a regular pillow, but if you want to pamper yourself the unique shape of this pillow makes it extra comfortable.

**UPDATE** I'm now 8 months pregnant and love my pillow! Mine came covered in a zippered cover, so that is what I wash.  Every few nights, I just grab the larger part and shake it HARD until the stuffing falls down, then fluff it and it is as good as new. I also like that, yes, it does take up some room, but no where near as much room as many pregnancy pillows. All in all, whether you like this pillow or not will come down to personal choice

After months of sleeplessness, I received this pillow as a gift from my mom. It is WONDERFUL, but not for the reasons I thought. I thought the big deal would be a nice wedge support for my growing twins (which it is), but the real relief is that I barely wake up as I flip from one side to the other, since it is nicely wedged between my knees

I have used this pillow for the last 2 months, with 2 to go.  I do like the shape of the pillow, I just wished it was a little longer.  I had been trying to use a king size pillow to cuddle with, but it was TOO big and hard to turn with.  This pillow makes it easy to keep next to you and to turn over.  I would just like it to be longer so I can have the little end between my legs, and the rest up higher so I can cuddle with it.  When between my legs (which helps) the rest of the pillow only is around my stomach and I wish it came up to my breast area so my arms could cuddle around it a little easier.  I would still give one to a pregnant friend as it is nice to sleep with.  Beware, my husband calls this the "Sperm Pillow", but if you can get past that, it's a nice pillow.

This is the third potty I've purchased for my son. The first one was made by Parents, and it tipped over the first time my son sat on it. The second was First Years Elmo 3-in-1, and the cup pinched his behind in 3 places leaving cuts. This one is great. Although my son was hesitant to go on it at first (which I attribute to his experience with the Elmo potty), he fits nicely on it. The other potties were too narrow from front to back, and I had to adjust him several times to get him situtated so that he could use the front guard. The seat lifts out as the cup which lends itself to not pinching his bottom; and easy clean up. It's low enough to the ground that his legs fit too. The back and arm supports fit well also. It's a solid construction and good buy.

I bought two potties before I realized that my boy had a big bottom and most other potties have really small opening and no pee guard in the front.  I broke down and bought this.  This doesn't have the bells and whistles like some other potty.  But it's beauty is its simplicity.  he is able to sit and do his business, carry the urine/poop container to the toilet and rinse it all by himself (he was not even 2 yet!).  I would highly recommed the potty training book "Potty training in less than a day".  it's out of print but you might find an used copy on [...]

I have twin boys that are 3 and I love this chair.  It doesn't have a lid or removable splash gurad.  I have two other sets of chairs that the twins only play with.  Putting the lids up and down, taking out the removable seat and catch basin, etc.  

This simply constructed unit has no corners or edges.  It has smooth contours including the splash guard that does not come off and is attached to the catch basin.  The catch basin is a combination seat/emptying pail which enables you to easily remove and empty.  It is easily cleaned and because of the simple design less appealing to play with.  

I think the best feature is the smooth built in splash guard which you need with boys.  

This seat does not convert to a toilet seat for the bathroom toilet, which I think doesn't work anyway - on the other potty chairs I purchased the seats slide and flop when you put it on the real toilet and then becomes unsafe.  I recommend the Babybjorn toilet trainer for that

Very cozy--great for wrapping up after bath to get warm.  But honestly, it's usually in the laundry.  And since swaddling lasts for a short period of time, it's use is pretty limited.  However, when it Is clean, I like having it around.

We have been swaddling our 8 week old since she came home from the hospital.  We tried the Swaddle Me, but I guess she was too small (7 lbs.) We were using the Miracle Blanket which we loved.  However, as she got stronger, she was able to kick and squirm her way out.  I got worried about her safety with a loose blanket in the crib, but she really liked being swaddled.  I took out the Swaddle Me that I received at a shower and decided to try it again.  It worked like a champ, and she is sleeping 7 hours at night now!!  I stretch it so that it's as tight as possible.  I bought another one, and the velcro for the feet is bigger - even better to hold it down.  We LOVE it and highly recommend!

After I had my 2nd son, we bought a Graco double stoller, but it was SO long, heavy and cumbersome that I only used it a few times before we decided to get rid of it.  We bought this tandem stroller a few months ago and I love it!  Great stoller, lightweight, easy to manuvuer and my 4 year old loves to ride in it b/c he can either sit or stand in the back.  It's much smaller when folded up than most of the other double strollers on the market too.  I wish that I had known earlier that it also has an infant carseat attachment.  I highly recommend this stoller, but do wish that the parent tray/cup holder came standard with the stoller

When I first bought this, over a year ago, I was hesitant about the price - it being so low compared to other brands. Rest assured, this is all you will need! My finicky baby had to have his warm Alimentum. This bottle warmer is sooo quick and easy, I could put the water up to the predetermined line of the measurer(that comes with) poor it in and left it alone. It was ready within a minute and after a few shakes, it was the perfect temperature. This is also helpful for warming up baby food jars (Comes with a special attachment just for that purpose) The warmer was dropped twice on the floor so it can defently take a beating! Outside is easy to clean (the water deposits on the warmer - not so much) All in all It did the job for my little boy. And for $16 GET IT! And Get one for the Grandparents! Don't spend $30 on a bigger and bulker item that will do the same thing

This works great with our Chicco Capri stroller. It took a bit of trial and error to get it in the perfect place so the stroller would close. However, once I figured that out, it was great. I could take the accessories off and just put them on when needed. The swivel is a great concept. I actually wish it came with a third clasp so baby could have a cup holder and snack holder (one on each side) and mommy could have her water bottle clip. We just switch them out for baby or they hold their sippy by the handles.

Seemed like a great system.  I came with TWO universal clips so you can use two of the holders at once.  If you want to use more then you have to remove one attachment.
It DOES NOT FIT MY ARIA TWIN STROLLER because the Aria does not have any tubing anywhere available once you close it up (and not much available once it's open.

I will admit that I had absolutely no desire to sterilize bottles the old fashioned way (boiling water in a pot on the stove) so when I saw this product over seven years ago I bought one immediately. I loved that it was so effortless! PAY ATTENTION to the instructions that tell you how much water to use based on your microwaves wattage. No one wants to wonder if the bottles are sterilized or so-so when it comes to their child, so read the instructions. I also purchased another when my second daughter was born because I gave my sister the first one. My only issue is that because of its small size (it has to fit in the microwave after all!!!!), you have to really stack the bottles, nipples, etc. in a way that utilizes all of the available space. Once again, the instructions clearly tell you the best way to stack. So, if in your sleep deprived, hormonal state you actually manage to read that stupid small instruction booklet you will save yourself a lot of heartache

I have used this product with all three of my children and it has been great. Easy to use and quick to sterilise.

With regard to previous comments about not sterlising equipment, I should point out that there is a difference between clean and sterile. All babies are vulnerable to the germs that cause diarrhoea and vomiting, and so it is best to continue sterilising bottles and teats (and breast pump equipment) until your baby is one year old and has built up more resistance to bacteria generally. Cleaning your baby's bottles and teats in a dishwasher will not always heat them to the right temperature to kill off all known bugs, so it's generally still advisable to sterilise after washing. If you do want to rely on your dishwasher alone, it needs to be run on a hot programme at a minimum temperature of 80 degrees centigrade. The bottles then need be filled with feed straight away as the dishwasher will not leave them in a completely sterile condition. 

It may seem pointless to sterilise feeding equipment when your baby is crawling around the floor and putting all sorts of things in his mouth, but the bugs that stick to milk curds can be dangerous. Your baby's immune system will grow stronger into the second year and he'll be able to combat infections more easily. 

It might seem inconvenient to some, but sterilising reduces your baby's chances of ingesting harmful bacteria and it's about the baby's health, not what the mother's feels she doesnt have time for.

Great product!  It makes your life a lot easier, not having to worry about boiling your bottles.  Please keep in mind that it is a "sterilizer", not a dishwasher nor a bottle warmer.  Somehow, a bunch of people misunderstand what this product does

This Boppy slipcover is super soft and wears well. We've washed it in the washing machine several times, and it's very durable. If you're looking for a soft, simple, durable Boppy slipcover, I'd highly recommend this one

Whoever designed this toy really understands the mind of the toddler.  My grandaughter took to this instantly and it became her favorite activity. YES, activity.  At a time when so many toys are designed to keep the child in one place this one gets them up and moving; no moving, no peek-a-boos! It contributed significantly to her becoming steady on her feet and building a healthier baby.  A good value at any price

We got this before our little one was born. She was born a little premature and only 4 lbs. We used it in her bedside bassinet, and later in her crib. Although we had a few false alarms once she started moving around the crib, they were worth it for the peace of mind all the other hours. Baby girl is now two and we continue to use it. She's in a toddler bed now, and we can tell if she gets out of bed when she's not supposed to! This is a great device and everyone should have one. Comparible in price to other nursery monitors, you get so much more. It also has clear sound and little interference in our house

This sensor is all about peace of mind.  We've been using it for a few weeks now and it's gone off twice - scaring us, but making us glad that we have it.  Both times that its gone off, our daughter has been very tightly swaddled, so we think that made her breathing shallow and thus set off the alarm.  You can change the sensitivity on it, but the default setting should be fine.  

There is a bit of background noise or static that you can hear.  My husband solved that issue by placing a piece of regular household tape on the bottom few speaker holes.  It is still loud enough for us to hear her without the extra noise.  

It does take some getting used to - you have to turn off the sensor and put it in sound only mode whenever you remove the baby from the crib, otherwise the sensor will go off.  But this `inconvenience' is totally worth the peace of mind this sensor gives you.  

I believe they sell this with only one parent unit - but you really want to get two.  Leave one in the bedroom and keep the other mobile - we constantly move the second from the kitchen to the bonus room, to the living room, etc.  

This sensor is an amazing product and worth every penny.

I am not an expert in anything. I am an emergency room nurse though, and I hear stories of babies dying from SIDS.  We thought we'd try this product as the reviews are great. We love it. The sensor pad is so sensitive that it picks up his every respiration! I would highly recommend this for every baby, as SIDS is a risk up until 12 months of age. I feel so much better, knowing that the alarm will sound if he stops breathing. We plan to take this with us when we travel. It is easy to use and it really works. If you buy the one with the two parent units, you can use the unit as a regular baby monitor instead, or as well

I shopped around for a cabana to take to the beach, for my sons first visit. I found this one, and let me tell you, it was perfect! It was so easy to set up and take down, and it was sturdy enough to stand up to the high beach winds. I saw a lot of other tents/cabanas on the beach and this one by far was the best; both price and durability wise. Excellent find and buy

These bags work fine in the Dekor diaper pail.   It would probably be easier if you could just buy trash bags from the store instead of special ordering them.   But I am borrowing this diaper pail, so these are the bags that it uses.   They do work great; keep the smell inside, etc.  If you order be sure if you need regular or Dekor Plus diaper bags.   There is a difference in the size of the bags

We love the Diaper Dekor and have referred it to many of our friends and family!  It is SUPER simple to use and the refills which seem expensive at first are actually cheaper than other brands because they last for 2-3 months vs. a week (i.e. Diaper Genie)!

From reading the other reviews, I think I can clear a few things up - it seems these people have been misled hence their problems with this product.  First, there are 2 versions of this pail - a larger called DIAPER DEKOR PLUS and regular size called simply DIAPER DEKOR. Thus, there are 2 different sizes of refills, PLUS and REGULAR.  You can find out which model you have by simply opening the door on the pail - there is a sticker that will have the model on there - if you do not see PLUS anywhere, you will need to buy REGULAR refills - the PLUS will not fit, and vice versa.

Secondly, the refills are VERY easy to insert, you simply follow the directions which come with the unit.  Basically, you remove the plastic insert, wrap the opened refills from the inside of the insert and around the top - the excess refill wraps around the outside of the plastic and then you sit it in the pail - knot tied in the bottom of the new refill.  If you have a unit, this will make sense - if you haven't bought one yet, I probably just confused you - but you will see once you get it that it is very easy to do!

Last but not least, the refills that have been on the market for the past year have absolutely no scent at all - I personally would not mind having a baby powder scent but these have no scent.  It's not like I will be sniffing inside the pail or anything, so it doesn't matter - afterall, once the refill is in the pail, NO SCENT will come out - not even dirty diapers!

Unfortunately, it seems these few reviewers who gave this product a poor rating were misinformed by store workers and their poor review actually had nothing to do with the product but rather frustration stemming from unknowledgable employees at baby stores.  I hope this has helped!  We've had this unit for nearly a year and absolutely swear by it!  It is a GODSEND!  No smells and how much easier can you get than just dropping a diaper into the pail and not having to do another thing!  Not many other units will allow you to store up to 3 weeks of diapers without a single scent

Diaper Dekor is the small, plus is the larger. There are TWO sizes--+ won't fit the smaller unit. We have the smaller and our Babies R Us (which is where we bought it) says "oh sorry, we only carry the big ones now." Nice! Now we have to buy liners online. I don't mind buying online but I don't appreciate that I can't go buy them where I bought the unit. If I'd had any idea they would quit carrying the smaller one we'd have bought +. It's excellent

When I purchased mine, there was no Diaper Dekor+ which is the larger size.  However, I feel that we have no need for a larger one.  My child just turned two and it holds a weeks worth of diapers...no problem!  I bought the Diaper Genie because I was told so many things about it and I hate it, it goes through bags quickly and the bags have a weird odor to them.  I am currently pregnant and am sensitive to odors and the Diaper Dekor holds them all in until garbage day comes

I bought the smaller version &quot;Diaper Decor&quot; (as opposed to the larger &quot;Diaper Decor Plus&quot;) about 18 months ago.  Although I believe the smaller version has been discontinued about a year ago, I have not yet had a problem finding the refill liners at my local Babies R Us or on-line here at Amazon.  I highly recommend the Diaper Decor. I do not have any experience with the Diaper Genie, so I cannot compare. I have not had any odor problems with the Diaper Decor.  It is very easy to change the liners and there is no mess. My foot-operated lid opener also broke like some other reviewers, but this has not been a problem with me.  I just open the lid manually and leave it open while I am changing the diaper. I would recommend the Diaper Decor in the Plus size

Our daughter started fighting the diapers when she was only 6-7 months old, so in a fit of desperation, I bought this potty, put her on it and never looked back. It helped that the potty was really comfortable, with a wide, flat bottom that left no marks on her tush, and stable enough so there were no accidents. 

I only give it 4 stars because I really could not snap the seat to the toilet and because the whole construction is so darn plasticky. Ah, and the music never worked (no loss in my opinion, I was there to do the encouraging) and the training book seemed a bit cheesy. A toddler may also entertain thoughts of removing the easily accessible container while sitting, which may lead to a whole new set of problems. But overall, this potty has made our lives so easy during potty training, that I cannot but lavish praise over this little piece of plastic

This little seat is very secure - no slipping or moving around on the toilet, yet it is easy to take on and off. It also sits tight enough that nothing leaks between the trainer seat and the toilet seat. Very easy to clean as well. I will warn you that little boys can still "shoot" over the small guard. I am careful to position my little boy so that he is slightly leaning forward so that the "projection path" is downward. I have tried other seats with larger guards but these seem to sit too close and/or he easily removes them. This seat is a molded plastic and the guard is not removable. Because this guard is not so large it would not get in the way of a little girl using this seat,too.

I purchased this video monitor based on the reviews to help me care for my elderly mother who is under hospice care.  It has been wonderful to be able to check on her without staying constantly at her bedside or running back and forth from one end of the house to the other.  The picture quality is great and the sound is amazing - I can detect changes in her breathing from the other end of the house!
I would highly recommend one to anyone in a caregiver situation or for parents to watch over their children.  It will definitely be put to use when grandchildren come along

  we purchased this monitor based on other great reviews.  I would have to say that it does work well.  The only issue we had was that it only worked on one channel for it to have clear reception from my daughters room to our master bedroom.  Also on that channel if it was on and the cordless phone rang it had a large amount of static and you would have to turn off the monitor.  It has given me peace of mind that I don't have to run in every sound she makes. I can look in on the monitor and see if she really does need me.  I would recommend this product

I am a disposable diaper mom, however, for night time or extra protection I throw the bummis wrap over the diaper and have never had a leak.  They wash up very nice and the velcro stays very strong.  It is by far the best wrap I've used

When registering for baby needs I laughed at the idea of wipes warmer - I thought what a waste! After my newborn startled and screamed during diaper changes I rethought this. This product has been a life changer! Baby is much more comfortable now and the warmer works great. Easy to use, the wipes stay moist and are easy to get out. Remember to purchase the pop-up wipes however. Great product. I would give as a gift.

I was that parent who said "I'll never spoil my child with a wipe warmer--it will only encourage her to wear diapers longer." And then I woke up and realized that warm wipes at night mean a baby who doesn't cry during changings and goes back to bed more easily--this could mean an extra half hour of sleep for me. I am now a big fan of the warmer. It works very quickly and doesn't dry them out, and the light is just bright enough to change the baby at night without waking her up. Definately a nice product.

We got this when our baby was about 6 months old, he is now 9 months.  At first, he wasn't sure what to do, but once he figured out how to jump in it, it was all he wanted to do.  The adults all get such a kick watching him go crazy in it.  It's a little awkward to move around, but the enjoyment well out-weighs that.

This jumper is worth it's weight in gold. My son is 3 1/2 months old and beginning to hold his head up so I decided this would be a great upright toy to start him out on since he loves to be in motion. At first he was a little wobbly, but after placing a pillow under him he is moving all around. I have never heard him coo and giggle as much as he does while in this jumper. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for a jumper. I am so grateful to have found such a wonderful product that brings my son so much joy

These can definitely be a life saver during the first 1-2 weeks when you don't want compression on the nipple and you want them to air dry.  I have small breasts so I could wear them in any bra, and I didn't have a huge leakage problem, so I changed the foam twice a day.
The only problem I had was that my skin broke out where the rubber rested against it.  I think it got damp and wasn't allowed to breathe because it cleared up within 48 hours after I stopped using them.  Bottom line: the relief was worth any minor inconvenience

I highly recommend purchasing these shells even before the baby is born...if you plan on breastfeeding. I was very sore in the first few weeks. The shells allowed me to apply lanolin cream on my nipples and let them air out and heal in between feedings. I did only use them until my nipples were no longer sore which mentioned before was only a few weeks. But they got me through those weeks when I don't know if I'd have made it otherwise! They were a wonderful product for me

You will need this extra base!! I ordered it thinking it would probably be a good idea to have. The day after it arrived my mother-in-law was sick and couldn't come over and watch the baby so my husband placed an emergency call to a relative and they were able to come over and pick him up. I had the original base with me at work 40 minutes away before this all happened

We have 3 of them and have no complaints. I keep one in my car, one in my husbands, and have another for travel.  It's super easy to snap the carrier onto it, and very easy to install in any car.  I just travelled for 2 weeks with my 3 month old, and had no problem installing the base into rental cars and other family members cars. I could use the latch, or just use the seatbelt for older cars.  I was worried that I would need my husband's help with the installation, but I was fine on my own just reading the directions. I recommend this for everyone

My husband and I have been trying to reduce our years of accumulated clutter, and to our dismay that includes FOUR infant car seats including our brand-new DuoGlider SnugRide infant seat. We were planning on giving one to my mother-in-law, one to my sister-in-law, and keep the third for my husband's car, but then we realized that more than likely, if we brought the baby over to their homes, chances are the baby would already be in his car seat.  We were thrilled to find out that Graco sells a SnugRide car seat base separately! This way, we can bring our son to Grandma's and she can take him for a drive without having to wak him to move him from one seat to another. The extra car seat bases simplify our lives and help us get a little closer to getting rid of all the clutter in the garage, too. Plus, the car seat base works with both the Latch system and with a regular seat belt. A must-have for parents who have more than one car and who have nearby relatives eager to help watch baby

I had a fabric seat saver for my leather seats before. Needless to say fabric doesn't protect leather very well. I ended up with deep depressions in the leather. Hopefully the leather will go back (fingers crossed). The firm bottom piece seems to work well to prevent any more indentations from showing up. And both of the carseats are as secure as ever. I have the rear and forward facing models.

The car seat protectors have worked well over the past several months I have owned them. They are a little too big and interfere with my kids trying to buckle their seatbelt. I own a minivan, so if your seats are fairly narrow compared to the seats of a minivan, I would consider a different brand. Good luck.

This seat took us from complete refusal to use a regular plastic potty to be almost completely trained.  For starters, kids like using the same seat as mom and dad..this seat allows them to do that comfortably. It is not too big and not too small, fits any toilet and travels like a dream. As the mom of a boy, I don't use the plastic guard because it sticks up too much over the seat, but even for boys this seat is mess free. And with boys, there is usually a little mess, but because it is plastic you can wipe it easily.  I love it, and my son loves it. I wish I hadn't bought the potty because my son refuses to use it..only this seat

Even though it looks like it will not fit at the beginning , it fits perfecly. Evenflo also gives you an extention piece with it. We needed this piece for our size opening , we really had to squeeze it in , but it is a great fit. The gate is sturdy and pleasing to the eye. It took about 2 days for us to get used to the locking mechanism , using 2 hands at first. After some practice it was easy to use. We liked it so much that we bought another .

I need a gate to keep my dogs out of my guest room.  It's used for an office and playroom, and it's the coldest room in the house so I like to keep the door open.  My daughter's friend broke her arm climbing over a wooden pressure gate that we had when it fell, so I bought this one.  It took 7 minutes to install, it's not going anywhere, and it's very easy to open and close.  My dogs can't climb over it because the bars are vertical.  I love it, am very pleased and plan to buy another one for my 8-year-old daughter's bedroom

We used this every single night with our son and even bought the next size up when he outgrew the small size. He was sleeping through the night almost immediately. Part of that was because he was so comfy when swaddled. We used this for four months until he learned to flip to his belly and needed his arms free. A def must have for every baby

My daughter had to stay in the hospital for 3 weeks.  She got very used to being swaddled, but after 4 kids I still can not do it right. This blanket makes her so comfortable she sleeps 5 to 6 hours at night at 3 weeks old. When both the blankets were in the wash she wouldn't sleep that long. She was up about every 90 minutes just wanting to be held. Thank god for this blanket it lets me get some sleep

This product was great in the first few weeks after we brought the baby home.  While others have said that the velcro is very loud for late night diaper changes, I found that I could keep it velcro'd on the top and just slip her legs out through the bottom.  My daughter really liked this, but quickly outgrew it.  At just one month old she didn't want her arms tied down, so the usefullness of the product is limited.  For a baby who loves being swaddled, this is an indispensible item.  I'll pass mine on with our hand-me-downs.  You never can tell which baby will want to be swaddled

I loved having this easy-swaddleme wrap!  It was so much easier than getting a blanket and swaddling where it might come apart.  The velcro worked really well as it gave "room to grow."  Swaddling our daughter only lasted for about a month or two, she just totally outgrew this.  It was great while it lasted and it's a fantastic shower gift

I love this sling!  But I'd like to stress as other people have done that you have to practice with it to find what works for you.  It may be too big for your newborn.  I started using it when my son was 4 weeks, but he was a large baby.  

I've found the key is wear it high!  The instructions say the you and your baby will be more comfortable with baby at chest height.  It's true!  If you try to wear it with the baby hanging a little lower near your stomach it's going to hurt your back and shoulder and wear you out and he/she's going to squirm and be uncomfortable.  

I used it every day of my sons 3rd month when we were in hotels between moving.  Now I used it every time I grocery shop because as soon as he's in it he falls asleep, no matter the time of day.  If I try to push him through the whole store sitting in the cart in his carseat he'll start screaming but if I put him in my sling I won't hear a peep out of him the whole trip.

And you have to admit it's so cute and stylish!  Several people have stopped to ask me where I got it and I love directing them to Amazon!

First, I must say that this sling was an absolute LIFESAVER when my (somewhat colicky) son was a newborn.  No matter how fretful his mewling, when we swaddled him and placed him in this sling, he would fall asleep. Because he otherwise rarely slept in those early weeks, he spent a good deal of time in it.  Three aspects of the design are great: 1. The bottom is padded so you can lay baby on a hard surface and use sling as a changing pad; 2. The sides are high and have drawstrings that allow the sling to be opened up almost flat; 3. It grows with your baby--my tiny baby hated the front-type Bjorn carriers, but loved this and still likes it.  One aspect of the design is, to me, dreadful--the shoulder strap! It should be wider and padded.  I tried repositioning it every which way and no matter what I did, the strap dug into my shoulder.  In the end I just put a thick mitten under the strap on my shoulder.  Good use for a mitten that's lost it's mate, but I would rather have a better strap

I am 5'5 with a large bust size and had a 7lbs 7 oz baby.  It took a couple times to find the most comfortable way for me to wear it but after that I have had no problems with it.  My son will get in there and go straight to sleep and I have never felt he was going to suffocate.  The pockets are a major plus and now since it is cold and flu time of the year I like it because all the touchy and coughing people can not touch him with any germs they may have since he is completly covered up.  He is still laying down in it so I don't know how it will work with him sitting up.

We have a very irregular iron banister with different sized spaces and bars.  This was the perfect solution because you can place the tie-down holes wherever you need to and the ties it comes with are really long, so they will fit around large or small bars.  We had to use a drill to make some holes further from the edge of the plastic because the hole punch it comes with wouldn't reach, but it was very easy to do.  I also like this product because it doesn't take away from the look of the banister or obscure vision

We were very pleased with how easy this was to install, despite the fact that we have rather unusual banisters.  Ours is actually a half wall and half banister, but the plastic was just flexible enough to bend over the ledge.  The directions weren't great, but it was fairly self explanatory.  We feel much more comfortable letting our one-year old play upstairs in the loft now

This product has really worked well for me!  My daughter used to love pushing her Barbie dolls in between the posts on our loft to see them crash onto the table below!  Now we don't have to worry about this anymore.  She can't reach her arm through these posts anymore either.  I use window cleaner to clean the smudge

I had checked out booster seats on the Internet and in stores and this was by far the least expensive.  It's a bargain -- well made and easy to use.  My grandkids seem to like it better than a high chair.  The seat arrived minus the safety straps used to attach it to a chair.  When I wrote customer service about the problem, they sent a whole new booster seat

Excellent value for money. Our 8-month old enthusiastically used this seat as a travelling feeding chair as well as a floor chair and we wouldn't have managed the holidays without it!  This seat is strong and stable, yet easily assembled/dis-assembled.  It folded flat to fit in our suitcase and has become a valuable travel companion with our young family.  We purchased this on 19 Dec and it was delivered prior to Christmas - well done Amazon

Seeing a 1 year old little girl playing these instruments is hysterical!  My niece absolutely loved them.  She had such an easy time handling them because they are her size, which is unusual.  All other instrument toys are so much larger and it's hard for them to hold on to them while trying to play them! The smiles and giggles are worth everything

My eight-month-old daughter really loves these instruments! We bought them when she was about four months old, but when she picked them up she'd often clunk her head with them when she tried to wave them around.  I brought them back out when she was six months old and had a lot more arm control.  Now she really goes wild with them, especially the bells!

My daughter plays with this toy at Grandma's house. Theses &quot;instruments&quot; are usually the first toys she pulls out to play with. The bright colors and different noises definitely interest her. She loves to shake them and make noise. They are great little toys to throw in the diaper bag when you're on the go

My daughter received these instruments as a gift last Christmas and took to them right away.  She was six months old at the time and they were easy for her to hold and shake to create the sounds.  We have lots of toys that make noise but these were some of her favorites, just the right colors, size and shape with just the right sounds!  She has turned one now and still gets lots of enjoyment from these toys.  They really encourage musical creativity in even the youngest of children

Perfect for traveling or packing in the motorhome.  For the price, it has alot to offer.  It has bags on both sides of the stroller for snacks, moveable sunshades to really keep the sun out of their eyes.  It's not the plushest stroller, however, for travel or quick errands it's perfect for us

I was looking for a double stroller that I could get in and out of my sedan easily. I didn't like the tandems because they not only take up tons of space, but they are also very heavy. This stroller is light, and I can take it in and out of my trunk with one hand. Plus, because my kids are heavy enough to push, I am not pushing an extra 25+ pounds in stroller. Because it is side-by-side, it can be a tight fit going through some doors, but I have never been unable to get through a door.  

My husband thinks that some of the parts are cheap and look like they can break easily, but with 6 months of lots of use, we have had no problems. The sun visors have bent at an angle when storing, but I can still use them fine and I like that they rotate down, so you can angle them with the sun. I am so glad that I bought this rather than a larger, more expensive, heavier tandem stroller

My daughter loves to cuddle with the soft sleep sheep and I love this product because it puts her right to sleep with the calm soothing sounds! I love the rain! even I fall asleep listening to it.
I had originally bought the sleep sheep because my neighbors upstairs have squeaky floors and they are walking around late at night and wake up my daughter. So I block out their squeaky noises by turning up the sleep sheep noise blocker :)  I am happy and so is my daughter who is sleeping like a baby!!!!!!!

Other parents told us about these, specifically the vanilla scented ones.

Baby #1 was bottle fed and took to an Advent pacifier right away.  We used the scented soothies whenever we couldn't get a bottle ready fast enough for her likes.  Not sure if it was the shape of the soothie pacifier or the scent, but she always calmed down wihle we'd finish getting the bottle ready.

Baby #2 was also bottle fed, but did not take to any pacifier right away.  We tried these regular soothies as well as the vanilla ones and the Advent ones too.  She eventually took to the Advent.

It really is up to each baby what they will like.  But these are definately worth trying.  In addition to the regular and vanilla ones, there are also various sizes, including preemie, pacifiers attached to small stuffed, plush animals that are easier for babies to find and put into their mouth...and also easier for Mom & Dad to in the back of the car, the darkened bedroom, etc

Finally a cute pink car seat.  It is duralble and easy to lift around. I wish they had this cute color for my other daughter.  Ihave not deliverd yet so I don't know how she will fit in it,  But I also have the stroller and everyone who sees the matching combo tells me how cute it is.  There is not any other pink combo out there.  I just hope it works as well as it shows off

I am not wild about the colors and design, but it's not too bad.  The fabric is easy to clean (machine-washable) and the sun canopy is GREAT! With an adapter, I can easily snap it into my Bugaboo stroller for ultimate convenience.  It's just a great car seat, although I wish there were cuter girly designs.

we bought this when my daughter was newborn, and we were surprised that her peg perego car seat fit into it so well, now shes a year and a half and even if were at home she climbs into it and plays with the steering wheel. She has always loved it, in the snow and on the ground and on picnics, its great, a lot better than plastic wheels, the front tire swivels and also has a little switch so that it becomes more like a jogging stroller and the front wheel doesnt move. Weve really liked it so far, except for the harness not fitting a very tiny baby, its GREAT. the only thing is now i have 2 kids and i cant use it cause i need a double on

We received a Graco travel system from our registry, and got some good use out of it. However, we are in a big city, and the stroller just couldn't stand up to the bad sidewalks and roads. Not to mention it was so rickety I'm positive we could be heard a mile away. I broke down and ordered the Jeep Liberty Limited Urban Terrain jogger, and I LOVE it. 

1. It was simple to assemble.
2. It is easier on my hands and wrists to steer.
3. The air-filled tires provide a much smoother ride for my daughter.
4. The toy steering wheel? She FREAKS out over it, in a good way. She *beeped* her horn about 30 consecutive times in the grocery store. Since that distracted her from pulling boxes off the shelves, I am ultra pleased. 
5. The price is wonderful.

We don't use the Music On The Move feature, so I can't really comment on it. I fill the tires right before we leave the house every time, and it's not hard to do, so I have no complaints there. 

It is a bulky item, so transporting it and carrying it is a bit tricky. However, the pros all outweigh the cons for me. I am extremely pleased with it

The crib tent is great!  We originally got it to keep our cats out, but then it served the purpose of keeping our son in too.  :)  UNTIL...  at 27 months, he learned how to reach through the crib slats & undo the zipper!!!!  :-o  So now we're in a hurry to get a toddler bed this week!  

It is hard to change sheets with the crib tent, but just get the "ultimate crib sheet" & it's a piece of cake!  :)  Also, it is *possible* to put down the side rail of the crib, but this does lower the tent too & can bop you in the head.  ;

This is such a versatile chair - love the way you can fold it down compactly, yet it's incredibly sturdy with the wide base when being used.
The tray stores on the back legs when not in use - nice touch.
For the reviewer who complained that the "thing that separates the legs" is attached to the tray - you can use the harness system to keep your child in place while removing the tray...  Plus it's easy to remove the top part of the tray and leave the base to keep the child secure while you clean up.
My 6 month old loves to sit with us at the table with some toys on the tray - terrific product to keep babies happy and parents sane during mealtime

Book looks exactly like the picture and the colors are vivid and nice.  The only thing is the puppet holes are really small meant for small fingers, so you as a parent might not be able to show your child how to use the puppet feature. I like this line of books better the the Bright starts and Baby Einstein books

I think everyone should one of these, especially for when their kids are young.   My 8mo. old tries to eat everything.   I don't want him chewing on the handlebars of grocery cars (yuck!) and it makes it much cleaner when you put him in a highchair at restaurants (which are sometimes disgusting).   The best part it fits over extra large shopping carts at club stores, like [...], unlike other types

I didnt know these things exsisted with my first child, now that I found them I use it constantly! This floppy seat is much better then others you can get for a little cheaper, but in the long run this is the best for your money! I have washed it at least half a dozen times, and its washes great! I also am so glad to have one seat the works for the cart as well as the highchair. THe other products I saw you had to buy one for each item. It was almost double the cost.
It does take a few minutes to get it hooked up, but its worth it for the quiet and GERM free shopping experience, and my son is so ccomfy in it! I have had lots of people ask me where we got it.
I love the added extras of having a cup holder pocket and some places to hook up some toys.
It is very plush and made of great fabric, it is not cheap in anyway.
THis is one item I dont intend to live without, I also think this is a great shower gift for anyone expecting!
I cant say enough about this product

I cannot go shopping without my floppy seat!  I don't know what I am going to do when my infant outgrows either the front pack or car seat as my toddler rides with the floppy.  I reccommend this to everyone who comments on it, to purchase for themselves or as a gift.  I have seen another seat with a large pillow in front for kids to sleep on, or as one mom with a little girl who has siezures could use as protection, but I can't remember where (babycenter.com, $60?). As other reviewers mentioned, I also used mine for the restaurants too, when my toddler was too small to fit comfortably in the seats (not to mention the gunk in the chairs!).  Buy this product - you won't be dissapointed

We bought our Floppy Seat when our baby boy was about 6 months old.  Even though he was still a little "floppy" himself when it came to sitting up, the Floppy Seat supported him. He's now 18 months old, and it's still going strong!  Although, now he wears "real" shoes, and the leg openings tend to get caught on then. It took a little practice to get the hang of the threading the belt through the cart, but now it's SO fast!  

We also use it EVERY time we go out to eat.  As a matter of fact, the one (and ONLY) time we forgot to bring it along, our son started to choke while sitting in a restaurant highchair.  The belt buckle on the old restaurant chair became stuck, and would NOT open, after multiple attempts!  We were forced to turn the whole chair sideways in order to proceed to clear his airway. He was fine, but we were all shaken up! If we'd had our (familiar) floppy Seat cover, we would have been able to help our son a few moments faster. Every second counts!

This Graco Family Tree Play Yard is perfect for newborns. The setup isn't quite as easy as the description implies, simply because the instructions are all pictures, without corresponding written directions. That said, a little patience the first time around makes setting up and putting away the play yard incredibly easy afterward.

The quilted mattress pad serves double duty to wrap around the folded up play yard when you need to take it on the go. I find this especially convenient because it guarantees that I won't leave an essential piece at home when I take the yard with me.

The description is a bit in error in regards to the mobile and the music. An attachment that sits on the side of the yard has an incredible variety of settings for vibration, music/noise, and lighting. There are different timed settings you can use to help get baby to sleep. The music is NOT, however, directly attached to the mobile. Also, the mobile sits on its own; it does not turn. That bothered me at first, but I quickly got over it when I realized my newborn didn't seem to care anyway.

The changing table sits higher than those on other play yards that I've seen, making diaper changes much easier on the back. The built in diaper holder and baby wipes holder are convenient for those rush changes. The changing table is padded and easy to clean up, though you need to use lap pads or something of that sort, as there isn't a removable pad on it. This is actually to my preference, as it's less stuff for my baby to have to contend with, but may be bothersome to parents who think their baby needs the extra cushioning.

When taking this on the go, as I said, it's easy to pack up. One minor drawback is the travel bag that holds the play yard. It doesn't have a handle, and it doesn't fit all the components of the yard. The changing table and the mobile sit at home when I take this on the go. The reality is, if I'm travelling, it's more convenient to not have these extra pieces to worry about. However, I'm not sure how I'll pack them up when my baby outgrows the changing table and is just using the yard itself. I consider that a very minor consideration though.

This play yard sits in my living room where it is incredibly convenient because it has space to hold all of my baby essentials so that I'm not having to constantly run to the nursery. I'm not sure what the parent organizers are intended to be for (they look like little soft-sided cup holders), but I've found them to be convenient places to store extra burp cloths, a pacifier, and socks that are just too little to stay together anywhere else.

This seat, along with the matching step stool are great!  My daughter loves having her very own, special toilet seat and step for going potty.  It has encouraged her to potty train, it fits the toilet seat nicely, and is easy for her to put on the toilet by herself.  I put a suction hanger on the toilet tank and is easily put out of the way when mommy and daddy need to go potty, and she can easily get it and set it up for herself as well.

We have the Baby Bjorn Step Stool, Potty Chair, Little Potty, and now the Toilet Trainer. Hind sight is 20/20. The Toilet Trainer and Step Stool is all you need. Our initial thought was to have the Potty Chair for home and the Little Potty for trips. The reality is our daughter would sit on her potty then want to sit on the toilet like Mommy and Daddy. We balanced her on the toilet before we decided to get the toilet trainer. No more balancing acts on the toilet. She can use her step stool to get on the Toilet when she wants. The toilet trainer travels well, fits all types of toilets, easy to install, remove, and clean! The Potty Chair and Little Potty are fantastic quality but you might as well go with the Toilet Trainer from the start

My daughter started with the Baby Bjorn stand alone potty seat - which was great when she was just getting started with the idea of using a potty. She quickly became too tall to use the stand alone potty seat, so I ordered this Baby Bjorn Toilet Trainer and it has been fantastic. She quickly learned how to put the seat on the toilet herself and adjust the wheel to make it snug. It was also easy for her to remove and hang on a small butterfly doorknob my husband attached to the side of the sink cabinet. The seat gave her a great sense of independence and allowed her to be comfortable and secure while learning to use the big potty. 

It is also great for traveling. I would put it in a zippered canvas tote and carry it with us into rest areas (it really does fit any toilet) - she could sit securely and be protected from unclean surfaces (I would carry a small container of Disinfectant wipes to clean her seat off each time we used it in a public restroom). 

I highly recommend this Baby Bjorn Toilet Trainer

I have a 10 month old baby and I have tried EVERY BOTTLE. I used the AVENT with my 1st baby. THESE BOTTLES ARE THE BEST! Why? Because they DO NOT LEAK, NO BUBBLES and the DESIGN is fabulous once the baby holds it her/himself. The angles top is great for LITTLE or NO AIR IN BABY'S TUMMY. The little rubber seal/disk you put in the bottom is a CINCH! Don't wast time or money$$$ on any other bottle

These are really good bottles.  I have been using them for 4 weeks now for my newborn son.  My only complaint is in regard to the stage 1 nipples they come with that you are supposed to use for newborns.  The flow is MUCH too slow.  My little boy could not get anything out of it and he tried and tried.  So if you plan on using these bottles, I would recommend going ahead and using the stage 2 for your newborn baby.  I am not the only person who has had this problem with the stage one nipples.  Other than that, these bottles are great

The pacified pod isn's "essential", but it's definitely good to have. You can keep the pacifier clean and easier to find in the diaper bag or in mom's bag, or you can simply hook this on the stroller if you are just going for a walk. And with all the cute patterns, you can definitely find one that suits your taste and matches your stroller or diaper bag

True -- as other reviewers have stated, this is not a gate that will swing open unless you use the hardware, which I have not, so I cannot comment on how well that works. As a tension or pressure-mounted gate, I love this item. I have no problems stepping over it -- and I'm only 5' 5"-- so I never found it to be a nuisance. It's easy to use with one hand and snaps into place easily. It's also easy to adjust the size to fit different sized door openings, although that takes two hands. It's light enough that I can carry my 13-month old son on one arm and the gate in the other as I travel from floor to floor. 

My 2 year old is learning to sleep in a room by herself so we use the gate at the doorway so that she can call to us from her room without being free to wander into the hallway or onto the stairs. Again, we love the fact that we don't have to damage the molding on the doorframes.

My husband and I are so satisfied with this item that we plan on buying another one

This item works for me perfect.  I had ordered two of them, but found one did so well I have returned the second one.  There was nothing wrong with it, I just had no need for it.
For the record.  I am not using this for a child.  It is used to restrain the movements of a pet.  It works perfect for that, so I am sure it would do wonders for a child

My house was built in 1862 and I have struggled with several different gates trying to get one to fit my odd sized, crooked doorways. This gate (when hardware mounted) adjusts to fit my doorways where no other gate could. I agree that it's not easy to use, you have to readjust the size each time it's opened or closed, but for me it's worth it to have a gate that fits my crooked doorways. Also, the hardware mounted installation template that was included made it SUPER easy to install. I'm very happy with this gate

This chair is larger than some of the seats out there, and fits my average-sized 2 1/2 year old boy very well. Some seem like they would be really hard for a boy to use, as things tend to spray out of the smaller seats! The seat is shaped just right for splashes, and it seems comfortable. Now if only my little guy would use it more than once a day, we'd be in business! I love the simple design, my son loves the color (he picked it out himself), and it's so simple to clean. It also has grips on the bottom so that it won't slide on the bathroom floor when he sits in it -- a must

These are one of two brands that my daughter does not soak through in the night. They wash up nicely and seem as good as the day I bought them. My only wish is that they had fold back laundry tabs for the velcro. They stick to other things in the wash. I think this puts extra wear on the velcro too

I am totally a fan of cloth diapering now that I've actually done it.  I must admit I was very apprehensive before I actually used them because I thought it would be so much work, but it really amounts to doing a load of laundry every other day... not hard.  These diaper covers are fantastic.  I have not had a single leak with them.  When my daughter was first born, a friend gave us several packs of newborn disposable diapers that we used for the first few weeks, and we had numerous leaks.  We actually used the newborn size of Super Whisper Wrap for the first two months and are on the small size now.  She was 6 pounds 11 ounces when she was born.  I use the chinese prefold diapers with them.  I tried two different types of the Gerber prefold, but they're just not as absorbant and were quickly saturated.  What sold me on these covers is how I can wash them with diapers when they are soiled and I don't have to hand wash them or anything

We are using this bather for our son who is one month old. What we like most about this bather is that the water drains away from the baby.  The fabric is also very soft, quick drying, and removable for machine washing.  The model we have does include straps that can be adjusted around the baby's waist.  To keep him warm, we pour cupfuls of warm water on him throughout his bath.  Since we don't fill up the tub with water, slippage has not been a problem

I like this product very much. It is very soft, unlike the other tubs where I was scared that my son would hit his head. The only drawback I have about is the belt....maybe in the next one they can come up with a good belt that would hold the infant. Other than that I  would recommend it to anyone. It looks very comfortable too. Especially if you have taller babies this is the best bathing system

My 4.5 month old son has never liked the plastic bathing tubs, so right from the very beginning, he's been in the big tub with a tub seat. He loved bath time until just a few weeks ago, when he outgrew our original Especially for Baby (the BRU "house" brand) tub seat. In desperation, we searched the shelves at BRU and settled on the Mother's Touch.

I can't say enough good things about this tub seat. The head support features a soft washcloth-like insert to cushion a newborn's delicate head, and it can be repositioned or removed as the baby grows. The two-position back reclines for newborns, and sits up straighter for older babies. The entire seat is up high enough that quite a bit of water is needed in the tub, but I found that it makes it easier to control how deep my baby sits in the water (in the old tub seat, he had to be up to his ears in order to have enough water to bathe in). One of the things my son hated about his previous tub seat was that he couldn't sit up in it. The design of the Mother's Touch provides enough support to allow Baby to sit up mostly unassisted, and the ample padding makes sure he doesn't bruise himself on the hard edges. Even though there's lots of support and padding, it's still very important to closely supervise your baby when using this (or any) tub seat. 

Another reviewer mentioned a couple of things things that I'd like to respond to: 
*There are no suction cups on the base: I have found that the rubber grips provide more than enough traction, but tubs may vary. 
*She would like a strap: the seat that I have does have a strap (it's stored underneath the seat, so may not be immediately identifiable), so I wonder if the seat has been redesigned recently.

Overall, my son and I are very happy with this tub seat, and I've been recommending it to friends. They'll have to buy it new instead of getting it as a hand-me-down, though. I foresee him being able to use it for most of his first year before he outgrows it!

We bought this to replace the one that our infant son destroyed by kicking the edge relentlessly. This one has curved sides and the ends are open to prevent such a thing from happening again. I also like that the surface is taut and easy to clean.

I really love these bumper pads and also the quality after washing is very good. the only thing i don&acute;t like is the way the strings work. there are not enough and also they rip off easily. not stitched well for the price. 
  
 Generally bumper pads are not recommended for babies before age 12 months since the air gets blocked away from the bed, also suffication could be a problem. 
 We have bought a convertable crib (common in Europe) which can be used till approx. age 5 and so we will attach the bumper to the bed later. 
 anyhow we still love it. it looks and matches perfectly to the rest of safari.

It seems like this carseat arrived about five minutes after I hit the purchase button. It arrived in great condition, too, and they even threw in a sippy cup!  ;-)   

The fabric on this cover (the Ashley Floral) is very attractive. I love that it can be rear- or forward-facing. A friend who had already purchased a different seat helped me install this in my car, and she loved it so much more than the one she got that she's getting this one, once her newborn is too big for her rear-facing-only seat. If only she'd bought this one, she said, she wouldn't have to go buy another.

Haven't had my daughter in it yet, so update coming soon

This chair is very sturdy and we keep it attached to our table as my son's only high chair.  I love how little space it takes up compared with a conventional high chair.  However, I bought this chair because by about 9 months my son would climb out of anything.  I thought a chair with nothing under his feet might give him less leverage.  Even with the shoulder straps as tight as they can go, he can wiggle out of it and stand up in the chair.  If you are looking to downsize your baby accessories and you don't have a climber - this is the chair for you, but if you have an escape artist - this chair is no better than typical high chairs

I bought this chair second-hand for my six month old son, and he loves it (whereas he hated the hard wooden restaurant high chairs).  It's a great size, easy to use, good color for hiding stains, and comfortable for him to sit in.  Best of all, because it folds up so easily and comes with a carry bag, we can be sure that he doesn't get exposed to the germs of every other little kid who frequents the restaurants where we eat!

This is an excellent product, and well worth the money

      Limited space in our townhome, and this hook on chair has been wonderful for us. This is our "highchair".  Make sure you look at the clearance dimensions if you have a lip under your table.  The chair arms (attachments) may not clear the lip.
      Strong, sturdy, easy to clean.  Knowing we can remove it and take it with us for a weekend visit is one less thing to worry about. Great travel drawstring bag.
      Great price!!!  Great product.  If you take the time to read the instructions and not force things that shouldn't be forced, this seat will work out for you.
     Something for the manufacturers, if they read these comments... personnal prefrence.  The harness straps should be a diffrent color then the seat.  Very hard to see/find when putting a baby in the seat, and its 5:00 in the morning

I discovered this product recently when I had my second baby.  I received it as a baby shower gift and I LOVE it.  It is so much easier than swaddling with a blanket. I have now bought the large one and my son (3mos) has yet to figure out how to get out of it.  The other thing that I like about it is that you can wrap the wings around the baby's waist or upper chest, leave his arms out, and use it during the day like a blanket.  Voila, a blanket that won't fall off when you're holding him, or be kicked off when he's lying down.  Kiddopotamus has really come up with some great products.  You might also want to check out the Piddle Pad.  Another great invention/product by Kiddopotamus

I loved this!  He was always right next to me but in a safe and separate space.  It folds up smaller than a pack and play, takes up very little room next to the bed, and has a netted tent cover for the summer to protect from mosquitos (or your cat who is dying to sleep with the baby

We loved the mini co sleeper!  Our son used it until he was around 4 months and his trasition into his crib was so easy.  I loved having him right next to me without the worry of rolling on him or waking him up in our bed.  I could check on him just by looking at him or putting my hand on him and I didnt even have to roll out of bed.  The mini co sleeper was so portable that I never even bought a pack n play.  We traveled a lot the first few months with our son and it was so easy to take his bed with us.  I highly reccomend the mini co sleeper and the leg extensions were great since our bed was a little high.  I will use this for our next baby as well

This  bed is great because our bedroom is small and the bed fits nicely next to my bed. It feels so good knowing he's so close. Its really convienent because we have to leave town for a night and this bed folds up small enough to throw in the trunk and he will still feel at home when he sleeps. Oh yeah, and its really cute

My 1 1/2 year old son really enjoys this toy. he loves putting the little men on top.  He doesn't play with the toys on the side, guess thats for younger kids, but he does enjoy the shape sorter and the drawbridge opening is cute and holds his attention.  I find an advantage over the classic Fisher price is that he can't as easily just rip the cover off and toss the pieces in when he gets frustrated.  At this age, I find the Alphabet pieces a waste and wish there were more shapes to sort.  Perhaps when he's older he'll enjoy the letters as well, but I doubt he'll still be interested.  Overall, cute toy that holds his attention while many do not.  Main drawback is that there are only 4 shapes to sort

I bought this item based on previous reviews and recommendations and was not disappointed at all. I love the color, the material is easy to wash, and most of all it keeps my baby warm and comfortable. I have a bugaboo cameleon stroller and it fits perfectly. My only recommendation would be for parents to purchase the toddler size rather than the infant size if your baby is older than 3 months. The bag runs rather small so the size labels can be decieving. Other than that, what you see is what you get! Worth every penny!!!

We haven't used this set yet because our baby is due in June, but have set it up in our crib. The fabrics are very nice and contemporary looking.  The bumper fits well in our crib, and the tags say all the fabrics are 100% cotton except the back side of the comforter which is a fleece type material and that is 100% polyester.   We are very happy with this set for our future little girl

This is the best carseat out there. It's above the Peg Perego and Britax. It weighs only 8 pounds so it doesn't break your arm and it is so easy to adjust. The best feature is the base is designed so that it does NOT MOVE in the car. I've had Graco infant seats that completely flipped sideways when I made turns because they just weren't secure even with the special belt clip. The only down side is the canopy is a bit floppy but it still does it's job. 5 stars!!!

When my daughter was born, I didn't know about swaddling, and it would take me HOURS to get her to sleep! I would feed or rock her in my arms until she falls asleep, then put her in her crib... and she'd flail her arms, wake up and cry, and I had to start all over! What a nightmare! 

Then I figured out that since her arms wake her, it would make sense to wrap her in something so she couldn't move them as much... so I started wrapping her in regular receiving blankets. It worked! It became much easier to get her to sleep. But then she wiggled out of those receiving blankets and wake up again. 

When she was a little over a month old, somehow I came across SwaddleMe blankets on the Internet and immediately bought it. It worked like a charm! It was so easy to wrap my daughter in it, and it stayed put. My daughter started sleeping so much better! 

I wish I found those blankets sooner - it would've saved me from so many sleepless nights! 

2 years later, my son was born, and thankfully I already knew about those blankets from the start. He goes to sleep great in the SwaddleMe blanket! Out of curiosity, I tried to put him to sleep without this blanket, and his arms wake him right away - exactly the same as my daughter! 

I consider this blanket one of the most important baby items you could buy. It should be a must for a new mother who wants to get some sleep

I and my wife have been very pleased with the Jeep Wrangler All-Weather umbrella stroller.  Unlike the cheap umbrella stroller we used to have, this one has better construction for the main folding support tubes. Plus, the handles are longer which means I (5'-1'' guy) don't have to walk like a neanderthal to push my toddler. The wheels do work pretty well on most surfaces even in very light snow.  The brakes are durable plastic and should last longer than my previous stroller. The pouches are an added plus for storing snacks or bus passes. 

My only disappointment has been the sun screen. It is not that useful for blocking the sun from my son's eyes unless I pull it directly in front of him. At that point, he can't see anything. That's OK if he falls asleep, but otherwise he (an independent todler) will pull the sunscreen off if it blocks his view.

An added bonus would be a shoulder strap that I could use to carry the stroller for walking more than a few feet. While it's light and compact for a stroller, it is still cumbersome to carry if you have to fold it on the bus or walk anywhere with it. Frequently my son wants to walk so I take the stroller with me because I know he'll get tired. So again, a shoulder strap would make toting the stroller much easier

I absolutely recommend this infant seat!  My son is almost 1 now and I am still using this seat.  It is fabulous for it's fabric options of colors and most importantly for it's roominess.  My son is on the chunky side, being an exclusively breastfed baby.  He is still quite comfortable in this seat and I love being able to just attach him to the stroller as i walk my 4 year old into her her preschool.  The travel system as a whole catches the eyes of many and I am always stopped by people saying.."what a ride!".  Well it is, quite a ride.  If you buy this car seat, it will last you for the entire FIRST YEAR of your baby's life.  Thank you Graco

I thought I would quit breastfeeding because my nipples were soo sore!  I saw my skin practically peel off my nipple when I started to breastfeed.  I placed the gelpads on, and within two hours, I could see the healing begin.  I tried olive oil nipple cream, and didn't even want to try anything with lanolin because I read it wasn't good to ingest,and it did not help at all. This is a great way to sooth nipples naturally.  Just let your breast air dry with a little of the breast milk (natural oils), and then place the pads on the nipples.  they are LIFE SAVERS.  I think I only needed three pairs, until my nipples were used to the rigors of breast feeding (about 2-3 weeks).  DON'T GIVE UP!  Try these first, these work

I used this pump with my first child 2 years ago.  I tried to avoid paying the $300+ for the electric pump, and this worked great!  I pumped when I returned to work, and pumped for 3 months.  I loved not having to lug around the big electric pump to and from work every day.  It's much easier to clean than other manual pumps (e.g. gerber) because there are few parts to remove so your chance of losing or breaking parts is much lower.  The pump has a strong suction, so I've had no problem expressing milk (e.g. up to 8 ounces or more each time).  I just had my 2nd child a month ago, and already I'm able to express 5+ ounces of milk at once.  I highly recommend this, especially for occasional users, no need to spend lots of money on fancy pumps with lots of removable, breakable parts.  Also, I am small chested, so no, you don't have to be well endowed for this to work

I bought this pump after the Avent Isis failed me along with an electric pump. The fact that this pump puts so much control over suction power in my hands is great. Im able to empty each breast in 15 min or less sometimes. Although its a little loud it is a manual pump and all manual pumps are a little noisy. From reading the other reviews I think that alot of other mothers expected results from this pump that just arent reasonable. Remember most manual pumps arent for constant expressing purposes or for bringing in milk supply. If you read tegh package the manufacturer even says that they recommend the pump for emptying breasts occasionally like when spending time away from baby or breastfeeding moms who express once or twice a day so others can feed baby. And they discourage it for working moms who have to pump everyday.

I too was given this pump by a lactation nurse, I pump at night after my baby goes to sleep. I think the pump is Great! It does what I need it to do and it very comfortable. The only drawback is that is is kind of loud. I would recommend this for a mother who needs to pump occassionally.

I bought this pump because it did have a hard plastic breast shield.  I had a double electric breast pump from first years that was soft plastic shields and I wasn't able to get a drop out because the shields didn't stay in place.  if you have biggre breasts I would suggest using this pump

The only bottles my daughter would take were the Playtex Original Nursers. I am pumping at work with a Medela Pump in Style, so I was pumping into the Medela bottles and then we were transfering the milk into the Playtex Drop-ins to feed her. It was a hassle and I never felt like all of the milk, especially the fat, made it from the Medela bottles into the Drop-ins. And then I heard about this kit and bought two immediately - I have been so happy with being able to pump directly into the Drop-ins. The only downside: you have to buy at least two kits if you double pump

I really love this system and find it has met all my needs.  My son receives only breastmilk and this system has made it SO easy to express, store, and feed him with a bottle.

I have not found the liner cost to be a problem.  Nor was I disturbed by how many kits I needed to buy.  I think I bought 5 or 6 to make sure I had enough.  It just depends on how much you're going to need to store.  But you don't need many actual bottles, since the milk doesn't have to be stored in them, so the price evened out for me.  Besides, it's much cheaper than buying formula!

I also don't care about exact measurements of how much my son eats.  I can get the measurement just by lifting the liner out and taking a look.  But when he's at the breast, I don't know how much he's eaten, so I don't track just how much he has from the bottle, either.  I just make sure he has enough dirty diapers.

I find the system easy to use because I can express directly into a liner, put the bottle into the freezer, then remove the liner from the bottle when it's frozen.  This reduces the space needed.  When it's feeding time, just pop one of them into a bottle, heat, and replace the cap with a nipple.  Easy!

I love love loooooove this system! I have been pumping exclusively for 4 months now and only found this about a month ago. Before this, I was pumping and storing in Medela bottles, then transferring to Playtex liners before feeding. Then I had to wash all the Medela bottles, plus Playtex rings, etc. 
With this system, I just pump right into the liners. They are so easy to just grab out of the fridge and go. I can warm a bottle with the car warmer using the self-contained liners, instead of having to bring a medela bottle to warm, PLUS a playtex system.
Overall, this has saved me several steps and less things to wash. For the dad who said it threw off the ounce markers - that is true. However, the liners themselves have ounce markings on them. Just unscrew the top ring slightly so that the liner sinks back down and then read the ounce marker on the liner. Easy!
I would not buy this system to use for storing frozen milk (if you store a lot of it). It would get too expensive for my tastes. I have two sets and that is perfect for refrigerator storage. Make sure you get two, because each box only comes with one pump adapter.
Highly recommended by one happy mamma

We had the Britax Roundabout for our daughters and were so very pleased with them, especially with the safety ratings.  When my older daughter was ready for a booster, the choice was easy -- BRITAX!  My daughter loves her booster.  When I first got it in the mail (we live overseas) I was initially disappointed because I thought she wouldn't like the side supports, but she loves them! 
I would like to comment on two previous comments....boosters are not FAA approved and shouldn't be used on an airplane.  Boosters are for use with shoulder seatbelts.  Second, you do not secure a booster down because it is not a carseat.  It is used because children under 8 and 80 pounds are too small for a shoulder seatbelt.  I simply want to comment on those because Britax makes a great....and SAFE product

This seems to be a secure seat, and our almost-5-year old is comfortable in it.  The buckling system is a bit inconvenient - you really have to get your head down there and put the strap in just right to get the side thingy snapped.  I wish our son could buckle himself in at this point, but this seat makes it too hard.  It's also not a seat you want to do air travel with, as it's unwieldy to carry around.  But, all in all I would say it's a good purchase

The crib arrived much sooner than I was quoted.  I was told 3 weeks, it came in 4 days.  Very prompt. It is a beautiful crib, I love it.  The directions are a bit lax.  It took my husband and I two hours to put it together. Mainly because the instructions only showed how to put together the ends and the drawer, and not the rest of the crib!  We finally figured it out.  Other than that the crib is beautiful

I have tested this unit on maximum sensitivity.  At first, I was bothered with the constant tick that is an indication that the baby is ok.  So I took the sensor out to see what would happen without the baby, ... it stopped ticking.  The baby was not moving, but just it's heart and/or lungs working keeps the unit ticking.  It detects even when you blow on the sensor.  Maybe it should not be on maximum sensitivity, since ceiling fans, etc might activate it, but I was truly amazed with the sensitivity.
You can turn the tick down so it is not too bothersome, it is like a clock ticking, about once a second when baby is ok, if it stops ticking for about 30 seconds.. a noticeable alarm will ring.

This monitor has kept me from ever wondering if my baby is breathing in the middle of the night. I test it frequently and it works. There has NEVER been a false alarm (everyone warned me I would lose my mind if it went off by accident, it hasn't). The only drawback, the channel is not so clear, there is static when you listen to it, but the peace of mind knowing he is ok is worth every penny. (I have a cheaper fisher price monitor for when I just want to monitor noise during the day, but I would not have another monitor for his bedroom.

This monitor is by far the best baby item we have.  I love that I can sleep at night, and the monitor will alert me if my son stops breathing.  We have been using it for 4 months, and have had no false alarms.  You just have to remember to turn it off when you pick up the baby!  I did not have this monitor with my first child, and I sure wish that I had.  It is a must have for any new mom who worries about sids, whether this is your first or your fifth baby.  Well worth the added expense.  Don't even mess around with other monitors, just get this one and get some sleep!  By far the BEST ITEM I own for my baby.

This is the perfect mattress for my little princess. It's nice and cushy while providing the necessary firmness. The vinyl cover is easy to wipe off if there are accidents.  It's also lightweight for easy sheet changings.  Sealy provides a solid, trusted product.  Not necessary to spend a lot of money on a mattress your child will use for 2-4 years.  My baby sleeps comfortably on it every night and she's tough to please! So I would definitely recommend this product to other parents

The chest looks as in the picture and that is what I liked, though the instruction manual can not get any worse than this.  My husband is very handy so he did not have such a hard time, although it took him 5 hours to put together, he got through it fine.  Instructions are not clear and they do not guide you right either but the chest looks nice in my baby room

I bought this Dakota backless booster for my nearly 6 year old.  She previously was using a Jupiter Komfort Kruiser XL100, which I loved.  The Komfort Kruiser was a booster with a back, and although it still fits her to this day, she was eager to move into a backless booster.  I think the Dakota booster works great.  It gets her to the height she needs for the seatbelt, but allows her to feel more like a big kid by not having a back.  This booster is a quality item and large enough to fit her until she will be old and large enough to no longer require a booster.  The pocket on the side is handy as well, although does not work well with drinks (I advise buying a bottle holder to put on the arm rest!)

This backless booster is a simple, last step booster bottom for kids who are ready to buckle themselves and like to change where they sit and are old/big enough to know their part.

The booster is light but well made. Its use is super easy, but the one piece arms help giude the passive restraint seat belts.

The fun color was a good bonus

It's so difficult to carry a huge diaper bag while having your baby in a carrier.  This product solves that problem!  And it's cute too.  I was shopping at Babys 'R' Us recently and the sales girl asked where I got my "super cute" diaper bag/carrier.  I told her and she insisted to her manager that the store start carrying the item (no word yet on whether or not they will).  I have recommended this bag to all my friends and bought two as shower gifts.  It's the ultimate in convenience and fashion

We've used this since our baby was born three months ago.  It has a the perfect combination of space for baby accessories as well as your own. It has two small external pockets for extra bottles and a large inside pouch where we keep most of the diapers and larger gear (as well as inside compartments). It also has a small cell phone pocket outside which we use.  The bag is excellent quality and not so large as to be awkward to carry around.  Our baby is still too small to use the convertible sling but I have seen it used on older children.

We'll be getting these as gifts for our friends who are expecting

My son is 5 months old and LOVES this jumper!!!  He can keep himself entertained and I am able to do some things with both hands!  Plus, it's so much fun watching him bounce himself up and down, laughing!
I love the tray around it.  It's big enough to set toys on but not get in the way.  Also, the strap frame at the top makes it so easy to get him in and out.  We are going on vacation in a month and this WILL be making the trip!

I originally bought this bag for a trip to Disney World.  It held everything great, stayed in place and was less cumbersome than a full backpack.  Although I was not using it to carry children's gear, I carried an umbrella, 3 bottles of water, granola bars, sun glasses, cellphone, keys, wallet a baseball hat and small souvenirs and it always stayed put and fit great!  I am looking forward to using the bag as a diaper bag, it has held up wonderfully as a vacation bag so far

This is a very easy to use cloth diaper cover and we have very few leaks- I had more leaks with disposables.  We are using these on our newborn and will continue to use them in the larger sizes.  I am very happy with all the money we are saving by using cloth, and delighted with the ease of use of this product.

it is a little costy but worth the money. it washes and dries perfectly also with hot water and blanket can be used in many ways. since we have tiles in our whole appartment i love to keep the blanket on a little carpet for extra warmth and cleanliness.a perfect place to play on when they are little and also to take along since it is very light weight. 
 once baby is older it can be used as a sleeping blanket or as a bed cover. its size is large enough to last many years.

I'm a mother of a 21-month-old. I just got a puppy and was having a hard time managing the stroller AND the leash on our walks. This backpack is perfect. It fits me well and my daughter loves it. She asks to stay in it when we're done! I was worried about that because she never liked any of the baby carriers I've tried before when she was younger. You do have to toughen up your shoulders (by taking shorter walks at first) before going on any long hikes, of course. I don't understand the chest problem on one of the other reviews, because the chest strap is adjustable, long, and sits just below the shoulders, avoiding the "busty" area very well. However, it does come out of the box at the shortest setting, so you have to loosen it to fit your frame. The question of being able to "close" the frame with the child in it doesn't seem to be an issue on mine. The stand part folds up easily under the child once the child is on your back. You do need long enough arms to grab it behind you, though. It makes no difference to you or the child if you leave the frame in the open position during your walk, but if you're in tight quarters, you'll want to close it. I did make the mistake of trying to put Aeryn's (my daughter's) feet behind me in the frame at first, which made her knees rest uncomfortably on the frame. The legs are supposed to go naturally forward toward either side of your waist. (The picture on the box helped me figure that out.) It is for kids from 6 months up to 36 months, and comes with a clear rain shield that easily zips onto the retractable sun shield. The rain shield is also helpful in windy conditions- my daughter thinks it's cool and leans over to fog it with her breath. It's not easy to do with a six-month-old puppy jumping around on you, but I've even managed to get into the straps and stand up from the floor with Aeryn in the pack (I'm reasonably fit, and she's just under 30 pounds). This thing is rugged, comfortable, good-looking, and has "be prepared" features like a cellphone holder and a matching fanny pack (that can be carried on the frame, if you'd rather)

I am a six foot tall women with large size ribs and medium chest and this backpack fits me very well.  As I am large and this pack fits me, I would think this would ajust to a small person well.  I especially like all the padding on the surface that meets your back.  I hike hills up to two hours with my seven month old (19 lbs) in the pack without problems.  The built in shade cover is great as you dont have to put it on and off as needed.  The pack is very comfortable for both of us.  The interior of the pack also adjusts for the baby size and as mine grows taller, I can drop him lower in the pack.  I looked at many other more expensive packs as I thought they would be better fitted out, but this pack has all the features I wanted for a lower price.  I highly recommend this pack.

my son was a very fussy bottle eater.  He would never finish his bottle until I switched to a faster flow nipple.  Now he finishes his bottle and is a much happier eater.  He became frustrated that the milk wasn't coming out fast enough for him and with the faster flow it was perfect.  He is much more content after a feeding and more relaxed.  Now we are both much happier and look forward to each feeding

Our grandson reciently came to live with us, nearly 2 years old and he refused to even sit on a potty. 
The day  our 1st pott arrived I opened the package and set the potty up in our bathroom next to the adult version hopeing this location would help.
 About 15 minutes later I noticed Drake had been very quiet.As I searched the house for him I discovered him not only sitting on the pot but he had actually used it ! He is now doing very well with his training !
 The product is well constructed, easy to to set up, and easy to use

I received my original New Native sling as a baby shower gift back in 1997. I wore it nearly every day for 15 months and then again with babies #2 and #3. Now we are expecting our fourth baby and the fabric is a bit faded and worn (we have the purple one), so I thought it time to buy a second sling. The original is still good as far as the stitching goes and we'll still use it, but I'm a bit tired of the purple color after nine years! :) 

Pros: This sling is the smallest as far as packing it with you. It's a simple double band of fabric that can be folded up in your bag or purse easily. Men don't mind wearing it (at least my husband didn't), it comes in basic solid colors and doesn't scream "baby!" when you're out and about. Many people couldn't tell I was wearing the baby when she was little. It's a good place for the baby to nap and to cover you up a bit when you nurse, once you figure that out. It's more versatile than other types of baby carriers in that you can use it from newborn to toddler (I've even used it with two-year-olds for short periods when they are tired of walking and the stroller isn't an option). You can carry the baby on your front or back (with experience, this is doable, but mostly for older babies), on your hip (once your baby can sit strongly). It's also easy to throw in the wash when the baby's diaper inevitably leaks or spits up all over it. (No complicated latches, webbing or snaps to clean.)

Cons: If you get the wrong size, the baby will hang too low and your back will hurt. My original is the Large size (based on chest measurements from the manufacturer) but I'm going to order a Medium this time. My husband still likes the Large, but he has a longer torso than I. Newborns may need some support in the New Native sling, otherwise you may feel they are swimming in the fabric. I always use a tightly rolled-up receiving blanket and place it in the sling first, then lay the baby's head and back on top of it. This pushes the baby up enough toward the opening so that you don't feel like she's lost in there. Usually I only do this for the first few weeks. After a while, your baby will be big enough to peek out on her own and wave at people.

The trickiest thing with the New Native carrier is learning to sling the baby on your back, which enables you to do things like cooking and unloading the dryer while your baby sleeps. You have to put the baby in on your front first then shimmy the fabric around with the baby in it. If you can master this, the sling is ideal for the fussy baby or for all-day babywearing.

Highly recommended! Good value for your money.

A friend recommened that I try her sling for my colicky baby. Our dear daughter suffered with severe GERD and would cry for hours. As soon as I placed her in the sling she would immediately relax. It was like magic and truly kept me sane.
After doing some reading I found that this was not only great for colicky babies but was better for their spines than other types of carriers and so much easier to take with us. Our daughter loved to be held and this helped tremendously. When we go on trips I always take it with me as she is sure to tire of her stroller. She loves hanging out in the sling and it is very versatile. I recently tried one of those baby carriers that are like a backpack thing to take with us on a trip since our dear daughter has somewhat outgrown her old sling and hated it. Bought another new native and am thrilled. One of the absolute best purchases that I have made as far as baby gear goes.

We have taken this seat on three flights overseas and on a couple of domestic flights, as well as on many car trips at home and abroad.  It is great!  It is quick and easy to install forward or backward on airplanes and in cars.  On some plane seats the buckle is under the childs bottom, but the cushioning is adequate, my son has never complained.  He seems very comfortable in it.  "Baby Bargains" recommended this seat for travel back when my son was a baby, and I am online ordering one for my daughter right now.  If you expect to travel, this seat is an essential.  It is light enough that lugging it around airports, cruiseships and such is not a total pain (although as with any seat, it is nice to have a bag, we've done it both with and without)

I don't know what one of the reviewies was talking about.. if you read the manual, you will learn that you need to move the "leg" on the front so that the seat sits Level.  That will keep your childs' head from falling forward.  If that fails, go to Burlington Coat Factory and get a wedge, to prop it up more.. (to most moms I know this has been common purchase)
I think that it is a very Nice and Well built car seat..  I do agree that it would be nice to have the Seat Belt tabs  so that you don't need the base.. but getting an extra base isn't a bad ideal, anyways..  
Remember you should always have your Local Police Department check your seats, before your child rides in it.. this is usualy a free service.. and is often held at a local Babies R U

I have a independent child. SHe will not let you help her do anything so when we got the the potty training stage she had to sit on the potty like mommy. She refused to use those little potty chairs also she did not want to be lifted up and she was still to short to get up on her own by a step stool. When I found this product she was estatic. She started the day we got it and fully trained herself by the end of the week. I agree the product if a bit Flimsy and could use another go at it. All in all I do not think my daughter was in any danger using this product though. Before you buy it though make sure you have a round toilet and not an oblong or else yes it will slide around. The manufacture told me this over the phone when I called them about the issues I had read. They said it is not made for every family and I agree you have to try something to see if it will work. Unfortunatly ever child is different and has a mind of there own

I was a little apprehensive about ordering this product, as I read all of the negative comments.  I ordered it anyway, because good comments described the potty as one that would benefit my son. When it arrived (earlier than expected), I noticed that it was easy to assemble, and that because it is not made with very thick plastic, it probably wouldn't be a good idea to order this for BIG children who are potty training.  My son is 18 months old, and 22 lbs, and it is perfect for him, sturdy enough for him to climb up and use the potty.  He really enjoys climbing up himself, and it does encourage him to be more independent in the process.  I let him look at the box, and we talked about how the little girl was going potty, and he liked seeing the little girl on the box :) using the potty, "just like him".  So if your child is very big, or potty training at 3+ years, I wouldn't order this,they don't need it. I would just get a stool

We love this seat.  It is great for keeping in the car for those times when you find yourself in a packed restaurant that is out of high chairs.  Or at mother inlaws without a highchair.  Or a family holiday dinner where there is no highchair.  When traveling with a little one or even just at the park or a sporting event.  There are so many uses for this great little seat.  It is extremely light weight and compact, and comes with a carrying bag

I bought this product after reading the many positive reviews below, and I was thoroughly satisfied.  My only complaint was actually with my luggage, as the handle on my bag was a little short so I had to stoop a little while I was pushing/pulling it.  Everyone who saw it thought it was the neatest invention ever, especially other moms traveling with kids.
The strap is so simple it's genious - just strap on the carseat and go!  It was a bit of a hassle restrapping at security, but everything is a hassle at security.  Just make sure you have a few extra minutes to get everything back together and it's fine.
This is a great product that made what could have been a very difficult trip a breeze.  Bravo!

We used the travelling toddler on our vacation with our 11 month-old son to Mexico.  We always buy him his own seat on the plane for his safety and it was a very convenient way to get through the airport with his seat and luggage.  He was attached to our rolling carry-on curbside and off we went.  We were able to check our stroller and we had little to carry.  At $20, you can't beat the price.  Our friends had to carry their car seat, stroller, luggage and child and were wishing they would have bought the strap

I found this product after searching for ways to make traveling with my two-year old easier.  She loved riding in her carseat through the airport and 6 people stopped me to ask how it worked.  The security agent said he wished all parents used this instead of trying to jam enormous strollers through the x-ray machine.

This is a great product. It takes a little practice to get the right amount of water. Disposables take much less b/c they tend to trap the steam, etc. I don't see how complaints about burning your hands could possibly be true. Sure it boils the water - it has to make steam! But why would you reach inside there? There is no reason I can think of why you'd ever need to do that. And with the first 2 children we used this on, I've never had a bottle even become remotely stuck, snug, you name it - not even close - so don't worry about it. I've used Avent 4oz and 9oz bottles as well as Playtex disposable bag bottles. It's not really a good use of money if you're just using formula - just make it with warm water. But if you're nursing your child and want dad to be able to help at night, this is a must have...

This is one of my favorite products I have purchased as a new mommy.  I love it.  It warms the Avent bottles great.  It took some trials to determine how much water to add but now I have it down great.  You can over heat and then you will burn yourself if your not careful.  It is not like the negative reviews if you pay attention and use the right amount of water. It DOES NOT warm the Playtex Ventair bottles.  I guess because of the vent but I preferred the Avent bottles anyway.  The cooler DOES keep bottles cold for up to 8 hours if you remember to freeze the freezer pack each day.  We have a 2 story house and this helped us so much.  I have the other First year single warmer also and it is in my kitchen and it is great as well.  This is definitly worth the money

I am impressed with this seat!  This seat is far better made than the seat that was on my toilet.  The training booklet that came with the seat has stickers on 4 different themes: PottyPrincess, PottyPirate, PottyPony and PottySaurus.  I called the free line (87-POTTYPAL) and was able to buy the stool (a little cheaper than Amazon's set) and 4 dolls to accompany the stickers as rewards. I am completely satisfied with the safety and sanitation of this product.

My daughter got this toy when she was 2 months old and she still loves it (at 8 months).  It was the only toy that would keep her entertained on car trips at first.

I took one star off due to some minor problems: 1) it is not machine washable (unless you don't mind loosing the barking sound) and 2) the battery can't be replaced.

Pupsqueak is wonderful. I am a picky mother about toys. I hate toys that are too loud, too commercial, too cheesy, too useless...I have high standards. But Pupsqueak gets my "picky mom seal of approval" wholeheartedly. Here's why.

I am very blessed to have a mother who loves to send my children lots of goodies. While it's easy to know what to send a 4-year-old with distinct likes and interests, it can be harder to gauge what a twelve-week-old baby will enjoy. We have no shortage of toys and gadgets to entertain our new daughter with, and she clearly enjoys some of them, kicking legs, cooing, , waving arms, etc.

The Pupsqueak, however, took it to a different level. She LOVES this thing. We showed it to her around 11-12 weeks old, and she immediately reacted. She laughed, she kicked, all the signs. Then, she reached for the little black and white patterned bone that hangs down. We were so excited, and she's had it attached to the bar on her carseat ever since. The real test, however, was our 10-hour drive from Louisiana to Kentucky for the Thanksgiving holidays. But Pupsqueak came through for us with flying colors: anytime she would get fussy, I could reach back and shake him a bit so he would jingle softly, and she would be happy again. After my arm would get tired, I'd make sure he was adjusted where she could get at him, and she would, at not yet 4 months, bat at it herself.

Pupsqueak is a wonderful toy with a soft, gently jingle for young babies and a funny bark that even makes my four-year-old laugh for older babies. He is definitely top dog in my book

We like this car seat for the price we paid. Likes: love the easily adjustable belts - we often let the straps out a lot to get her in it without her being uncomfortable and then tighten it appropriately. The 5 point harness is great. Love that the car seat is compatible with different strollers. Dislikes: It doesn't recline as much as we'd like and the head padding is superficial. Our baby's head tends to fall forward a lot. The sun canopy seems like it was designed as an afterthought - it certainly works more than adequately, but doesn't move easily. Finally, the handle is difficult to move from position to position. Overall though, for the price, it's a good seat.

I was very pleased when I saw just how beautiful this car seat was. Now that my daughter is 3 months old I feel I can give it a review. I read many things about complaints but I just don't have any. Everything works well on it. It doesn't fit well in all carts but carts weren't made for baby carriers to fit in them so it's not a bad thing about the car seat itself. All infant carriers will have the same problem. I recommend this to anyone who wants an infant carrier and likes how it looks. It's pretty and fits great in it's stroller. All in all, it's a great buy. Although my next time around, I'm passing up the infant carrier and going Britax. They're much safer imo from what I've read and heard

This was a great carseat and carrier.  Easy to install with the level indicator.  A few drawbacks:  Once my daughter was a few months old, it got really heavy to carry around.  She also outgrew it by 6 months.  The harness needs to be longer.  It doesn't release enough to get taller babies in and out comfortably.  And for some reason, the release levers to move the handle to get the baby in and out were really stiff and difficult to use.  My mother in law has arthritis and ended up having to either carry the carseat with both arms like a bundle of wood (because she couldn't move the handle up) or try to slide my daughter out of the top or bottom (because she couldn't move the handle back).  My advice, before you buy, realisticly test everything on it in the store and compare it directly to another brand

Baby size: My daughter started out at just over 5 lbs, and this seat fit her well from the beginning.  The straps have adjusted easily as she's rapidly grown, I haven't had the adjustment problems other reviewers had.  The head support worked well too (at first we had to use a rolled towel inside it for her tiny head).  A baby's head will not fall forward as long as the seat is properly leveled according to the convenient indicator on the side of the seat, but if the angle is even slightly off this can happen easily.  The seat can only be leveled in the center seat of some sedan backseats (like my Toyota Camry) because of this angle requirement, but there are leveling accessories you can buy to help with this issue.  

Portability: I love the stay-in-car base, which I found easy to install properly.  It's also very easy to snap the carrier portion in and out, and very obvious whether the carrier is secure or not.  An extra base is great for families with multiple cars, as either parent can quickly snap the seat in and go.  The carrier portion is convenient for quick trips in and out of the car, but I find it much too heavy to comfortably carry long distances with a baby over 10 lbs (and I'm fairly strong).  It will not fit securely enough for my taste in the child seat portion of a grocery cart, but it does fit well when placed sideways across the larger basket portion; I just stash groceries in the large space left underneath the carrier and in the rest of the basket.
  The Snap n' Go stroller is great if you're taking this seat farther from your car.  It's much more lightweight than the large "travel system" Graco also sells with this seat.  It's easy to maneuver and comfortable for most people to push, but a little too short if you're much taller than 6 ft.

Durability: I can't comment on the seat's lifespan, as we've only been using it a little over 2 months.  A few times I have noticed the sticking carrier handle other reviewers mentioned, but it doesn't happen often.  The canopy seems rather flimsy to me, but we only use it occasionally when using the stroller, so it hasn't been an issue so far.

Other considerations: Windsor seems to be a fairly gender-neutral pattern, if this matters to you.  My baby wears a lot of yellow clothes, and people seem to assume she's a boy about 60% of the time when she's in this seat.  The carrier handle has several different positions: up for carrying, flat for carseat use, and down for resting the carrier portion on a flat surface without letting it wobble.  With the handle left up, the "wobble-enabled" carrier portion can be rocked slightly on the floor to stall a fussy baby as you try to finish an errand before she erupts.

I would buy this seat again.  Its only drawbacks are its weight (probably unavoidable since it's a carseat and must be sturdy) and the rather stringent placement requirement for leveling (but at least the indicator lets you know about this problem)

My daughter received this as a gift from Mommy when she was about 3 1/2 months. At first, she was petrified of having the objects so close to her face, but if you take off a ring take it higher, your child will really appreciate the colors and enjoy the toy.  The only complaint I have is the mirror it comes with still frightens my child.  The mirror distorts your child's vision, so I took it off and purchased some other hanging toys for it! My daughter loves it, she could be eating her breakfast, or sitting in her swing and all she'll do is stare at her playmat! A definite must for all parents

We got this monitor because of other reviews we read about it. We have a Graco for our daughter and it picks up so much static and other back round noice. You can hardly hear her on it. 
The Baby Quiet Sounds works great as far as being able to hear the baby clearly. The receiver eats up the batteries fast and has some fed back with only batterie use. Our Graco does that too so I don't know if that is the norm with monitors. The sound is the best when pluged in. The nightlight is great. The humidity function I have not figured out as of yet. It say's it is 19% in every room and I don't know that is correct. The temp works fine. I have not played enough with it yet to set the controls and how it works. I like that the time is on the receiver and that it lights up to see it at night time. I haven't used the timer yet but could see how it could be helpful. 
Over all - like my choice in the monitor.

We heat our home with a coal stove, so when it comes time to put the baby down I worry that the room might become too cold.  With this monitor I can keep an ear on the baby at the same time as keeping an eye on the temperature and humidity level in her room.  The humidity level comes in handy during cold season, I've found.  The night light on this monitor is great, it's very adjustable or you can shut it off altogether.  I've not owned it very long, so I can't comment on durability yet, but so far so good.  My [..] has dropped the parent receiver once or twice and it's still fine.  I would definitely recommend this monitor, thank God the price was right too

I've been using this pump for ten months now and it is the main reason I'm still nursing my little girl.  I went back to work when she was four months old and started pumping three times per day.  At first it was hard to try to be productive for the 20 minutes per session I was pumping because you really do have to hold the breast shield to the breast, suction isn't enough.  Then I got the Easy Expression Hands-free Bustier which has solved that problem.  I can now do e-mail, talk on conference calls, etc. while I'm pumping so I don't waste time at work and continue to give my baby the benefits of human milk.  I'm able to fit four standard bottles and two of the smaller/slimmer Medela bottles into the small cooler, with the ice pack so I don't think the cooler is too small.  Also, I don't think the cooler was meant to be transported in the backpack.  If you don't try to cram the cooler in the backpack there's no problem with storage in the backpack.  I also reccomend the Medela Micro-Steam bags for working moms who choose to pump once they go back to work. Also, I don't think the suction is too hard...yes it may be uncomfortable for the first minute or two until the pressure of engorgement has been reduced, but it is by no means painful.  Pain is what I experience when my daughter bites with her new razor-sharp teeth!

The PISA is an amazing pump and the cost is equal to a few months of formula, so my pump has already paid for itself (used for 6 months and still going strong)! I've tried generic immitations and they just don't compare. Invest your money in the real thing, it's worth it

I am so greatfull to this pump! I was able to exclusively breastfeed two children for a year each, while working full time, taking vacations (without the kids), etc. I also have the car adapter which is awesome, I was able to pump to and from my work, (which is over an hour away), while driving. I only recommend that for breatfeeding/pumping pros! The warranty is only good for a year, but mine is now three years old and still going strong. We are expecting our third child and I hope my pump holds up for another year, if not I will still probably spend the money on another pump like this one! Best of luck

I was looking for something very simple for my little boy and had a lots of troubles.Most of the potties I looked at were constructed in a manner of a throne or a spaceship and I didn`t want anything like that.This potty is very simple and easy to wash and doesn`t have no distracting blings.Just what the doctor prescribed

 This potty is just right for our little boy. He seemed comfortable from the first time we placed him on it. His little feet touch the ground, and the shape not
only supports him but also protects for little boy mishaps and gives him something to hold on to while bearing down. I would definitely recommend this, especially if you are starting early !

I cannot say enough positive things about this item! I absoloutely loved the fact that it helped to keep my son warm on cool nights but it was safe enough for him to use in his crib every night. This item needs to be brought mainstream so that it can be available to all parents for their kids.

I got four of these sleepsacks, two fleece and two cotton.  I found the fleece sleepsacks do get bitty after a couple of washes, but it didn't effect the product.  They are wonderful.  If you are buying for a newborn, get the 6-12 month size, since it'll last a bit longer. I ended up giving away the 0-6 month size, when my baby was only 3 months old, as it was getting a bit small.

My son has been wearing the halo sleep sack since the day he came home from the hospital.  Being a winter baby it was the best thing in the world to know that he would be warm and not have to worry about loose blankets.  He began sleeping through the night at 7 weeks old.  I think the sleep sack gives him a feeling of security.  He was never able to sleep without being in it.  He is now 30 months old and still won't go to sleep unless he is in his sleep sack.  We had to have a friend of ours who is a seamstress add additional material to the bottom because he became to tall for it.  That is how much he loves his sleep sack.  It is by far the best thing I ever bought for my son

Like any parent, I was concerned about SIDS so the SleepSack seemed like the perfect alternative to blankets.  Little did I know, I would come to LOVE the SleepSack for it's warming capabilities. After a few months under their belt, babies get VERY squirmy in the middle of the night, so blankets are useless (and dangerous).  So I relied heavily on the SleepSacks to keep my little guy warm, even after the risk of SIDS passed. They come in fleece for winter months and cotton for warmer months, and they're generous in size, so they are not outgrown easily. I only wish I'd purchased them in yellow or white, in case my next baby is the opposite sex

my baby is now 5 months old, and we've been using the Halo sleep sac since she started moving around more.  I was always worried with the regular blanket because more than a few times she would wake up crying because she had kicked her regular blanket onto her face!  Now, I never worry that she will soffocate or that she will be cold in the middle of the night.  This product really gives me peace of mind and I'll be sure to give this to any new parent friends

Good things: (1) No interference. We live in a residential neighborhood in the suburbs. (2) Connects with no problem two stories down with the baby on 2nd floor and the monitor in the basement. I've even used it out in the yard without any loss of connection problems. (3) You can hear pretty much everything happening in the nursery.

Only one bad thing--the belt clips on the parent units are practically useless. They are not large enough to stay on a belt oe waistband with any normal amount of movement and the lip at the end of the clip digs into your side if you have the unit on your waistband

We struggled with 2 different monitors before we got the imonitor by graco.  The first 2 we tried had so much static and interference that they were useless.  I can't explain how delighted my wife and I were to hook up this monitor and hear nothing but the sounds of our baby.  It was better than Christmas morning when we were kids!!!

We have wireless internet, cell phones, cordless phones, basically if its electronic we got it.  Despite all the potential for interfence the Graco delivers chrystal clear sound with absolutely no interference.  A must buy for any parent

This item was very cute.  The different textures (just like the bedding set) are a lot of fun.  I hung 2 on the wall above my sons changing table and he loves to look at them.  My only complaint is the ribbon loops they've sewn on to hang them.  Mine were not sewn into the middle of the square and so they originally hung uneven.  You can easily use a nail or other type of homemade hook though

These wall hangings are lovely.  The different textures are very cool.  Maybe mine were different than everyone elses, but they came with little ribbon loops on the back, and i don't get why there's an issue hanging them.  They're very very cute, and look adorable in the room.

I was given these wall hangings as a present.  I love them and they make the room look great.  We also were presented with the problem of how to hang them.  There is what seems to be a dowel pocket in the back, but that seemed too complicated to deal with.  Therefore, my husband and I attached a safty pin to the back of each square in the center at the top.  My husband then used a finish nail in the wall, and used the safty pin to hang over the nail.  The pin is low enough so you do not see it or the nail the square is hanging on. It was easy to do, and the wall hangings look great!  I thought there would be a problem with getting them to be straight, but they are light enough to manipulate and stay where they are placed. I hope this helps others with this problem.  I still wonder though, why on earth the company didn't foresee this problem in the first place

I already have a single jogging stroller (not a BOB) and have been happy with it. We are in the process of adopting our second child, which we had less than 24 hours notice about, so a lot of money is going to legal costs, baby stuff, and my time off of work, and as a result I was concerned about spending this much on a stroller, but is was worth every cent. With the BOB Duallie, I am ecstatic, overjoyed, delighted, thrilled and looking forward to my next trip out. 

For my first trip out, I put my 2 year old and 11 week old in and went for a six mile walk. The trip was so smooth, both kids slept for most of the time. The seats recline enough so that my baby is nearly flat, no problems with his head bobbing around (pardon the pun). The shocks give this stroller an incredibly smooth ride, which transits to less work for my arms. I didn't realize how much effort went into the other stroller, pushing it and turning it. The smooth ride also allowed us to walk faster, a plus when trying to lose weight.

The stroller can turn in circles on itself, allowing for extremely sharp turns. Very nice, especially when inside a small store, like Starbucks. The windows up top are well placed enough that I can actually see my kid's face, not just their little bodies. The straps are the easiest to adjust of any stroller I've used. There is extra padding along the shoulder straps to cushion the kid's shoulders. The straps at the waist don't come out of the sides, (this is kinda hard to explain) the strap is attached in the center of the seat, and the sides come around the child, more like a belt and allowing for a snugger fit. Even my 70 year old mother had a great time pushing the stroller. 

As for the Mesa Orange, it is more like a burnt orange, with brown trim and I am very glad I got it! It is not at all like the neon orange it appears in some of the photos. Be sure to get the tray, I forgot to order it with the stroller. The storage is a little shallow, but being double wide, there is still plenty of room for stuff.

I bought the 100 pack thinking it was all the ultra thin kind, which I love, come to find out only 60 of them are ultra thin.  Some of the women on here complain about having to change their pads often - you really are supposed to do that, because otherwise you will get an breast infection, especially if you live in the south where it's warm and humid.  I recommend the ultra thin pads, the other ones that come in the variety pack are just "OK"

When I had my daughter I had no clue where to begin with breast pads so I bought several different types.  A friend gave me these at my baby shower because they were here favorite.  I wish I had never wasted money on the other pads.  I did have to change these pads more often than some of the other brands.  It was worth it because they were so much more comfortable.  I didn't have any chaffing like with most others.  Also they stayed in place ten times better than any pads with adhesive.

These are the best pads for the task...the ultra thin pads are great for during the day...they dont leak and are very breathable...the heavier flow pads are great for overnight protection depending on the amount of liquid that you are leaking.  i am now nursing my 2nd daughter and i will forever use these pads.  the variety pack also offers the best value for your dollar.  try every kind you get...samples are free so use them but when you have to buy these are the most natural and positivly the best.

it is very sturdy but the brush broke after only 3 weeks. i have searched the web and can't find anywhere to buy a replacement brush for this item so the whole thing doesn't look quite as good with a brush that doesn't match.

Bought 2 different monitors; this one has great features such as the motion sensor, auto and scan settings. The night vision is weak but daytime looks great. Better reception than the other video monitor I bought but not having good night vision is a drawback. I really bought the video monitors for keeping an eye on my mother who has alzheimers but using the 2 cameras comes in handy for both baby and mom. None of these seem to be as quiet as just a regular baby monitor without video but it is very comforting to see and not just hear. It is the best one that I've found on the market

We purchased this carrier for our sons car seat 4 years ago.  For perspective, we are heavy travelers with 4-6 international trips/year and always bring our son's car seat along. This carrier has been indispensable for us. It fits our large Britax Roundabout, plus has space for a bag of diapers, soft toys or the extra shopping from our trips.  We use the back pack or wheels to tote it around airports or onto planes. As our son grew large enought to not need the seat on the plane, we simply check it through as a piece of luggage.  The material is lightweight and we have had a few small tears along the bottom of the bag, but we were able to repair them easily enough by ourselves with needle and thread. We just adopted a second child and bought the same carrier again for her car seat as well

My husband purchased this bag for me when I recently took a trip solo with my daughter. It seemed to be more troublesome than helpful. I ended up using the backpack strap to pull the bag because I could not pull using the regular strap in a comfortable positition. On the 1st flight the bag ripped at the seam on the bottom from scraping on the floor. When I arrived at my destination I restitched the bag and thought that maybe I had been careless in my handling. On the return flight we had to do more walking since the airport was a little bigger, though it was still a small airport. When I arrived at my destination the bag had completely separated along the bottom stitch and my car seat base had been scratched and mared as a result. The damage to the bag is so bad that I can never use it again. This bag should be labeled as disposable. Though this is a good concept there needs to be better planning on the overall design and quality. I would NOT recommend this product and will think twice before purchasing any other products from this manufacturer

We like this stroller.  It seems to be pretty durable, and its weight and portability (shoulder strap) make it ideal for trips, especially in airports.  My husband has a hard time pushing it sometimes because he is so tall (6'4"), but it is fine for me (5'3").  We like it for our 5-month-old son because he is able to recline, but still sit up enough to watch what's going on.  He can hold his head up well but isn't sitting up unsupported yet, so the various levels of the reclining back are nice.  Overall, a good stroller for the price

We bought two of these to take on a family trip.  We chose these both for the price, and for the higher weight tolerance (45 lb).  Our 40 pound six-year old can swap places with a sibling when he gets tired during a long day at the zoo.  They recline far enough for an infant, also.  But, our 10 month old preferred to sit forward and hold onto the front bar to take in the sights.  The strollers are compact and light.  The underneath storage mesh can hold a purse and small diaper bag.  There is another pocket on the back that can hold a water bottle, as well as a latch that can hold small items that have handles.  The stroller was also easy to maneuver.  We are very pleased with our purchase!  The stoller can even hold a Combi carseat, but it didn't work with our Graco

I absolutely LOVE these paci keepers and highly recommend them.  They are the only ones that my son doesn't manage to rip off of himself.  I got so tired of trying to reach over the backseat to find a dropped paci while my son was in a rear-facing car seat.  That made for a horrible trip.  I purchased these and they are awesome!

I have this exact same soft light green deluxe pillow. I bought the pillow when she was about 2 weeks old. And I have been wearing it almost all day long every day since. She is 11 weeks old today. She is so comfortable when nursing on this pillow. The cushion is made of firm foam. She falls asleep on the pillow while it is around my waist. Even when she's not nursing or napping, the pillow helps me to support her weight when I'm sitting or standing. It fits me very comfortably even though I'm plus size.

The only drawback is that I need to order an additional slipcover because it can only be hung to dry, although it is machine washable. I really love this fabric, but apparently, this fabric is not available to purchase separately as a slipcover, so I guess I'll try the oatmeal twill cover.

The car seat itself is awesome, but the condition it arrived in was awful.  The box was smashed and caved in and it had been exposed to rain or moisture of some kind.  There was nothing covering the seat (like a plastic bag) so debris had gotten into the box and soiled the material on the seat.  It was a gift for my Grandson for Christmas so I didn't have time to return it and hope for a timely return.  It took alot of time and effort to clean the spots off the seat.  Simply packing the seat with a plastic bag over it would have made alot more sense to me.

This stroller holds up to 55 lbs., unlike most umbrella strollers which only hold 35 lbs. I love the raised handle bars. They cause less strain on your shoulders and back. There is a roomy basket under the seat, which is a great bonus. The 8 wheels make it easier to steer and push over rocks or grass. Once my son was able to sit up on his own, I have used an umbrella stroller exclusively. This is hands down the best one I have ever had. It is also very modern looking in black and gray

I own a lot of strollers for my twin sons ((this one, the duoglider, two small single strollers, and a double umbrella stroller)) and I absolutely LOVE this one!

First of all, if you want to be a satisfied customer you have to know what the purpose of the stroller is, which is for jogging, or maneuvering outdoors on rough terrain. My husband jogs with the stroller at least once a week ((and has no complaints)), but I on the other hand just adore it for the outdoors. The wheels go over almost any surface, including gravel, dirt, grass, concrete, brick, sand, boardwalk anything, I love it. The seats both fully recline ((individually)) and when they do, the rear of the seat is mesh so you can see your child from behind ((although you would most-likely have to bend down to get a good look)). The five-point harness on a jogger is a MUST HAVE, and this model even comes with comfortable pads as well. The basket is HUGE and holds everything we need for a day at the beach/park/walk around the block, which is very important to me. It is also removable, but I don't see why it would be advantageous to take it off. Plenty of other storage is available behind the seats as well, handy little pockets and pouches to store little knick-knacks. Considering the type of stroller it is, it folds very easily, and I can fit it in the rear of my minivan after removing the rear and front tires ((which is equally as easy to do, rear tires come off with the push of a button and the front has an easy to use release mechanism)). The canopy is enormous and proves for GREAT sun protection when needed! The breaks are FANTASTIC, and stop the stroller in its tracks which is very important if you are jogging, and need to stop quickly, according to my husband anyway. The included wind/rain shield is also very convenient ((can be left rolled up to the top of the canopy, incase there is a chance of rain you don't have to work for 5 minutes to attach it and get the kiddos wet)), but I do wish it also came with mesh covers for mosquitos and other bugs.

I do dislike the fact that it is EXTREMELY difficult to turn ((although I have kind of gotten it down to a science, you need to be prepared for the turn and tilt the stroller a bit, the turn is very wide and not that smooth)). I think it would be better if it had a swivel wheel which had the option to lock in place for jogging ((a swivel wheel would actually be extremely dangerous if jogging as you could lose control of the stroller)), but that's just me personally. The baskets are near impossible to access if both seats are reclined all the way, and I have had to wake sleeping babies on a few occasions ((that's why I have learned to put things such as my cell phone and wallet in the canopy pouches, so I don't have to constantly go into the basket)). The canopy is quite large, and if you are not using it its quite a pain to retract as it doesn't go back neatly, and if its a windy day the canopy doesn't always stay up.

If you are looking for a good stroller for outdoor use, and don't mind the large size or getting used to turning, then I highly recommend the Tike Tech

I am sure this is a good stroller (that's why I bought it!)

My "review" is more of a word of caution: this thing takes forever to arrive.  Don't be fooled: "Usually ships within 24 hours" really means "May ship sometime".  As of 2/8/06, our stroller has not arrived.  It was ordered January 1, 2006.  It is not even slated to ship for another week (we'll see...).  
Meanwhile, the local store has several in stock.
My advice for anyone trying to time this as a gift or for a trip or other occasion: go to your local store.  Otherwise, be prepared to wait a very long time.

This is the greatest product.  They stick to every restaurant table I have ever secured them to, are lightweight, easy to pack and fun for my daughter to look at.  Every time I pull one out of the diaper bag she says "Elmo, Elmo, Elmo".  They keep the germs away from her and the clean up is so simple.  I wouldn't do without them, they are great

Table toppers are an awesome product. We don't leave the house without them. It gives our daughter a clean area to eat and helps the waithelp.... there is no mess when we leave because it is contained on the Table Topper. We just wrap it up after her meal and toss the whole thing. The different designs also entertain our daughter while waiting for our food. Other people, not only parents, ask about the Table Toppers and comment about them because it is such a convenient and easy to use product

I did A TON of research on convertible infant-toddler car seats before my son outgrew his Graco SnugRide at 4 months. Consumer Reports gave this and another seat the highest safety ratings (this seat had the highest rating of all Britax convertible seats!) I chose this seat because it has EPS side-impact protection under the carseat cover. It's worth the extra money because it's your child's life! Also, it's really easy to tighten and loosen the straps, and the cover is really silky and comfortable. My son falls asleep within minutes of pulling out of the driveway.

My only gripes are that none of the existing toddler pillow neck/head supports fit into the seat, but that may be a problem with the manufacturers of the supports, not Britax. Also, the straps don't have soft covers to keep them from digging into my son's neck. I just bought some soft terrycloth ones from Babies R Us for $4.99. It works

If you have an ipod or mp3 player, I'd recommend getting this.  I think the baby is going to love it!  I bought it last week, and tested it out (our baby hasn't been born yet).  The speakers are plenty loud enough for a baby's crib or room IMO, and I'm 1/2 deaf.  I also like the little nightlight on it that changes color.  
My only criticism is that it takes batteries (no AC adapter).  We may invest in a rechargeable set of batteries if it uses batteries up quickly.  For $20, I think it's great

I was actually surprised at how good the sound quality is from this iCrib sound system. It has very nice features like a 15min or 30min shutdown timer, so you can put the baby to bed with music and then the iCrib will shut down after the specified time. The nightlight is also really neat, as it cycles between four different colors. The only problem with this product is that it cannot run on AC, only on batteries, so we'll be buying lots of batteries over the next couple of years, but otherwise this is a great product.
Edit--After further consideration I would drop the rating to 3 stars for two reasons. First, I have found the lack of an AC power source to be very inconvenient. Second, as the batteries wear down, the sound quality from the speakers deteriorates significantly

Just love it! I had the Jeep tandem and it was nice until my son got so big (40 lbs, 39 inches) you couldn't steer it very well. The BOB is amazing! I have a 3 yr & 1 yr old. You can't feel the weight difference. It rides so nicely. Both my children are very tall/heavy (dense) for their age and my eldest has plenty of room to grow - which was my biggest concern. My husband just loves the shocks - go figure. It compacts nicely....and if you need it even more compact the wheels come off in a snap and can be stored in the seat. It's amazing! I'm so glad I purchased it. REI has a great price on it ($400+/-...tried Ebay too but REI was best. Have fun in your stroller search and good luck

i got this for my baby due in march. even though i live in new england area i knew the original bundle me would be too heavy. its perfect wieght for the 50-75 degree weather. it stays on the infant carseat at all times and that way my husband will never forget to have a blanket for the baby. it washes well too! if you do get a day here and there when its a lot warmer and you don't need it then the top part zips off and you don't have to take baby out and remove the entire product. then the next chilly day zip the top back on! great all around

When it comes to using this for your children you'd have to first know what your needs are. I can't imagine it stopping any determined child without some reinforcing; it would be more like a psychological barrier. But depending on their temperament and age it may be good to deter them from getting to things they shouldn't have.  
I ordered this to use for my puppy.  In my case I don't have the problem of her pushing on it so I can't say how long it would last through that.  For this price I was quite happy with the quality and it was amazingly simply to install.

Just received this set and my wife and I love it! The construction is very solid but not too bulky for us. The micro-fabric seems to be in high quality and goes along nicely with our furniture. The only two complains are: 1) The handle's height is not adjustable, which seems a bit too high to us (I am 5'6" BTW); and 2) it would be great to have a hand-break (i.e. wheel lock button on the handle) -- We previously thought the red button on the handle is a wheel lock but it is not; it is the collapse/expand button instead. Despite these imperfection, we feel it much worth the $195 we paid for

This is great to have if you are going to be on the road and need to pump.  The long cord was helpful too, so you can sit in the backseat and be discrete. It was a bit tough to insert into the outlet in my car, but I 'm hoping that it gets easier the more I use it.

I bought this yesterday when I knew I was going to a "tailgate" party where I would be away from the baby and having a few drinks, and I may have to "pump and dump".  I was nervous at first, but this thing worked PERFECTLY! It worked just like it was plugged into an electrical outlet. It successfully pumped my breasts in 10 minutes and it fits into the case next to the regular plug. I also bought the Medela sanitary wipes to clean the breast sheids since there was no sink near by. This outlet plug is a must have if you want a quiet, clean and safe place to pump your milk. The cord is 8ft long so you can go back into the car. I love this thing and wish I bought it sooner!! It will also be great on long trips, too, so you don't get any clogged milk ducts. Highly reccommended!!

I was using the diaper genie and I wasn't at all impressed. I was at a shop needing to pick up Genie refills and saw this pail on sale for $14. I bought it. From day one I loved it I threw out the genie and I won't go back.
It only got 4 stars because you do need to buy fresh disks every so often. They are nice because when you open the pail you smell a fresh clean sent. Also I feel the pail could be taller, when I change the kitchen bag (which is the only time you really smell the foul diapers) my bag was only about 3/4 the way full. 
But other than that its a great investment, no smelly nursery and no dang refills to buy

this bin is great for cloth diapers. we love ours. keeps odors to a minimum and holds a day or two's worth of diapers-- which is all i need because we wash every other day. Our local Babies R Us sells replacement deodisks (or you can buy them online from cloth diaper vendors) when the one that comes with it loses it's smell so that you can maintain freshness. It's easy to clean and use and pretty inexpensive

After reading the reviews and reluctantly we bought the stroller.  I am glad we didn't listen to those naysayers.  It was the best decision we made because the stroller is wonderful.  The comments people wrote about how the stroller is awkward and heavy is a bunch of rubbish.  Yes, the stroller is heavier than its predecessors but they fail to mention how sturdy it is.  We've had the stroller for 2 weeks and we hike up some hilly mountains (Stanford Dish if you are from Palo Alto) and it rides smoothly.  It gives me comfort that the stroller is well built and protecting our two daughters (2 year old and 4 weeks old enfant).  I feel secure that the stroller will not fall apart after a few rides like its predecessor.  Also, we love the capabilities, spring shocks for a smooth ride, shorter so we can navigate through some tight corners and it is not awkwardly long like the other double strollers.  We have a Toyota Sienna and it fits just fine in our back trunk.

As for the weight.  Yes, it is heavier but come on, it is not "10" times heavier.  People exaggerate too much.  If you are accustom to carrying your 30 pound toddler in your arms, then the stroller is nothing.  People are too much of a wimp.  It is slightly heavier than its predecessors but not by much.  They made it heavier because the load baring bar is what keeps the stroller steady and sturdy.  Gives me peace of mind that my precious asset in life (my two daughters) are protected. 

The only recommendation is that the back two wheels could squeak which can be annoying.  Just use Silicone spray and they all went away.  We've been through rain, dirt, and hot sun with this stroller and we've been so happy with it.  I highly recommend purchasing it.  but make sure you have a truck, mini-van, or SUV.  I am not sure if a standard vehicle can house such a stroller.  But I figured if you have two toddler/enfants, you may consider getting a bigger car

Baby has had less gas and fussiness since we have been using these bottles.  Quick cleanup, quick fill up.  Love the nipple variety too.  

Because of the liners, it is easy to keep two of these bottles in use and not clutter up the kitchen with bottle pieces, etc.

Would highly recommend

Tip!!! You can push a 4 oz. baby "Juice Bottle" that juice for your baby comes in at the grocery, up into the Playtex Nurser bottles to extract the air from the liners.  This will prevent punctures from your fingernails. Be sure to remove the "Juice Bottle" before feeding baby

I have tried these for the first time with my fourth child. I wish I would have used this system for all my children. I have used all kinds of bottles from the old glass bottles to Vent-air to Avent...many types with my first 3 children. I decided to give these a try considering I was tired of scrubbing bottles. My little girl switched to these very easily from the breast, it helped tremendously with her colic by cutting down on gas (switching from regular formula to soy helped to, plus I had to start avoiding all milk products while breastfeeding)plus they are so easy to clean and manage. I have had no leak problems like I did with Avent...Vent-air #1 nipple would collapse plus my son would have projectile spit-up after feedings when I tried to switch him to the #2 nipples (awful system)...absolutely no problems with the original Playtex bottles. My only minor complaint is trying to fit my fingers in the bottle to collapse the liner to rid of air...very hard if you do not have tiny hands. We bought the easy-feed bottles with the lift in the bottom to aid in releasing air...alittle easier. Store brand liners work just as well as brand name liners...I have seen no difference except in price. Target brand is very good. I would recommend these bottles to everyone

I can't find on this website the exact tub I bought for my daughter, but this tub looks most like it.  I tried using a baby tub that converts to sitting up to be placed in the big bath tub, but that didn't work at all.  The small inflatable tub is definately the way to go.  My daughter can splash and wiggle and not get hurt or uncomfortable at all.  It is a pain to blow the tub up, but our tub has a little hole to hang on a hook, so we just constantly keep it inflated and hanging on the tub wall.  My daughter is nearly 1 year old now, and has been using this tub for about 5 months.  There is still plenty of room for her to grow and I think she'll be using this tub for awhile.  I feel she is safer in it than if she were placed directly into the big tub

We have 4 yr old twins and an 18 month old, and selected this gate as a means to block off our dining room from the living room.  We needed the gate (which already came with one extension panel) plus one more extension panel (we purchased additional) for a total of 107 inches across.  

It wasn't that horrible to install--just read the directions first and allot your self a couple of hours.  If you measure well and take your time, it's not that difficult.  Also best to attach it to a stud in the wall for xtra durability.

As for durability, you need an adult sized hand to open this latch--my almost 5-yr-olds can't do it.  The extra foot adds stability.  The baby has tried many times to push it over or break through the latch and never succeeds.  We like that you can set it to swing only one way if you choose, since it prevents it from smacking into our dining room chairs.

As for appearance, the neutral oak on this gate looks soooo much nicer than those pricier metal things.  We've received many compliments on our wide spaces gate (and matching stairwell gates) from guests, and it only takes seconds to slide out of the wall brackets and store if we're entertaining company.

I think some of the previous posters either had way too high expectations for a baby gate (it's not a brick wall!), or installed it wrong.  I would recommend this gate to anyone, especially those with multiples that need to gate off a portion of a large area to create a safe playspace

I bought this seat a couple weeks ago and my 2 month old nephew is using it when I have him until my son is born in June. I love the look, style and safety of this seat. The only thing that I thought may be a problem was the way the shoulder straps adjust height. My nephew is 22" and he is almost on the second to last adjustment. Also the side impacts don't leave alot of room for a head positioner for newborns and they are far enough apart for the head to have room to wobble side to side. My nephew seems to love it though and seems really comfortable in it. The upright position is something I like, I have never seen him sweat in it, he seems to have growing room, the canopy covers him fine, and I think it is the most comfortable to carry. His parents are using an Eddie Bauer and I know alot of people (including me in the past) that use Graco and other brands and they seem roomier, but not as safe. Also I haven't seen a baby over 4-5 months in the infant seats anyways, I don't know anyone that would want to lug around a baby over 15 pounds in an infant seat, I guess that's just the few of us who aren't body builders. My nephew is 11 pounds now and he is getting pretty heavy in the seat, it's a good thing that the seat isn't too heavy itself. I would recommend this seat, but I can't explain the other reviews, so mabey trying it out in the store is best for everyone

This is an excellent product.  It is such a good idea given the many warnings that are out about SIDS.  I felt reassured at night that our child would be able to breathe if she happened to roll to the sides or the ends of the crib... and that she wouldn't get her arms or legs stuck between the slats.  
I was expecting that the fabric would be a white cotton... and was happily surprised that it is made of a white satin material.  We even had family members that thought that someone had made the CribShield for us.

I got this system for my 18 mo. old who was playing a game by sticking his leg through the slats of his crib and then claiming he was "stuck".  They have helped prevent him from doing that any more.  However, if he's in the mood, he can easily dismantle the entire contraption - so it won't work to keep an older child from tearing it apart if they want to.  In fact, the two end panels had to be removed because he wouldn't leave them alone.  All in all though, I think the mesh "bumpers" do what they claim and they work well at keeping toys (and pluggers) in the crib instead of out on the floor

Overall, we are very happy with this product. I like that it covers the entire side of the crib and doesn't come up only partway like a traditional bumper. Also, I like the breathable netting since baby can see out through it and since it "gives" a bit when baby pushes and kicks it. We have a nonstandard length crib (Babee Tenda), so we do have small gaps at each end of the rail, but we had read about this issue in another review from a Babee Tenda crib owner, so we knew up front we would have these gaps. These small gaps have not been a problem for us as our baby doesn't seem to want to stick her legs through the gaps in this location (I think it's difficult since she would have to lie almost flush with the headboard or footboard to do so). The white satin edge is very pleasant to look at. Overall I like this product much more than the traditional bumpers I have seen.

We used the small size until our daughter was too long for it (around 3 months old) and switched to the large size.  She still loves it and is sleeping great (3 day naps and 10-11 hours uninterrupted sleep at night)!  It is part of her naptime/bedtime routine and it travels with us so she can get good sleep in a familiar environment wherever we are.  The velcro has been a lifesaver and the microfleece helps her stay warm but not overheated.

My baby outgrew the regular sized Swaddle Me at 2 months of age.  I ordered this one and when it came in the mail I couldn't believe how huge it looked!  We didn't actually use it until about 2.5-3 months since it was so big.  We would fold the top down before we swaddled our son in this so it wasn't as long.  At 3.5 months, our baby weighs 17 pounds so it's hard to find something to swaddle him with, and he still needs it.  I hope he doesn't outgrow this one in the near future.  I think he'll be one of those kids who has to be swaddled till he's 6 months old and this blanket should work

The Medela breast pump works with Dr. Brown's bottles (you can pump directly into the bottle)!  Just an added benefit to an already great product.  I've been using mine almost daily for 11 months and have had NO problems.  It's worth the money if you plan on breastfeeding/pumping for more than a couple of months

I have used Medela's Pump In Style Advance for 4 months now after having my first baby.  This pump is the best in its class and it is the best thing I bought in 2006.

Why I gave this item 5-star ratings:-

1) It helped me to establish a steady milkflow from the 2nd week of breastfeeding.  I am a working mom and had only 8 weeks off from delivery till I have to get back to work again.  So it was important for me to rely on a good breast-pump to keep the supply going.  

2) This pump is comfortable to use and I can regulate the speed which is suitable for me.  The Medela parts are easy to set up for usage and also easy to wash & sterilise.

3) It never breakdown ever!  For 4 months now, and I'm pumping 4 - 5 times a day.  I bring this unit to the office and also whenever I am travelling.  It is very mobile, although a little heavy to carry.

4) It has a battery pack which is handy whenever I am in a place without power-supply.

5) I bought this online in Amazon for USD$ 319.  But in Malaysia, this unit would have cost MYR1800 (USD$ 500).  

Just a note for non-US users (like myself), you need to get an adapter which is compatible with this pump.  This can be easily obtained from any electrical shops.

This is a good buy, if you're looking for a pump, then you have found it!

To bring the co-sleeper up to the height of the bed, these leg extensions are the best bet.  Yes, as someone else said, they do make it a little shaky.  
So if you are not planning to attach the co-sleeper to your bed, you may want to leave the height alone.  (You'll be getting up anyway, so it probably doesn't matter how tall it is.)  But once attached to the bed with the anchor strap, rather than free-standing, it was very secure.

We've had this bed rail for about two months now for our 3 1/2 year old on his full size "big boy bed".  We're quite satisfied with it.  

Construction:  Very sturdy, our son jumps on his bed and rolls around and the bed rail stays put and does not seem like it could possibly give way.  The mesh is soft which is good for the times when he wedges himself in the corner to sleep.  We tug on it from time to time and it's not going anywhere.

Assembly:  Not too easy, the instructions are horrible, but once you realize on your own how it's supposed to go, the actual assembly is OK, but not quick.  Very easy to adjust the width to your bed with the simple strap feature.  

Hide away feature:  This is what took away the 5th star.  It's not very easy to unlock and push it under the bed. That feature works but requires some wrangling.  If you want the hide away feature for once in a while, I wouldn't let that stop you from buying it, if you plan to hide the rail daily, I don't recommend it for that.

Making the bed:  Easy to tuck the sheets around it, no need to hide away or struggle.

Overall, I would highly recommend this bed rail, I read all the reviews, and asked many friends, and this seemed to be the best in all areas, and a good value for the price, considering other can be well over $xx

I love this car seat stroller.  It goes from car to airplane in no time flat.  Great if you travel with small children with just one adult.  Also great if running errands and your child falls asleep, no need to wake them up to get in and out of the car.  However, the older they get and the more they weigh the harder it is to get the whole thing in and out with them in it.  I still love this product.

B.O.B. Rocks. BOB is very high quality and has held up extremely well for us after nearly 2 years of use. We're a little attached to BOB in our house. Let me tell you the Revolution is the stroller to get. We bought it right after our baby was born, choked up $40 or so for the infant seat bar and have used it as our primary stroller ever since. Even in the mall, department stores, etc it's great. Baby gets a smooth ride and daddy likes it because it's agile and almost effortless to push. I see hundreds of Bugaboo strollers around and I must admit they are nice but B.O.B is my choice because of price and you can go more places with him. 

Our other seldom used stroller is a Graco something or other and I don't even know where it is. However I've used it enough to compare it to BOB when collapsing it and putting it in the car. I must say BOB is easier and faster to fold and go.

One downside might be that the storage compartment under the seat is smaller than some of those jumbo strollers. However, BOB is built like a tank. We travel with BOB a lot through airports (Yes BOB fits through most airport XRAY's while normally collapsed but sometimes I have to take off the back wheels which is easy) and we hang stuff off of BOB's handlebars and even carry our jumbo car seat on top of the sun shade until we get to our car.

Our family is now looking for a double or tandem stroller. This get's interesting because I don't see us doing the duallie BOB Revolution since it's a no-go in the mall, Target, etc. The Phil & Ted's E3 Buggy and Double Buggy are looking tempting but I don't like that the older child sits tucked behind the stroller.. They can't see anything. What I wish B.O.B. Corp would do is come up with an attachment to at least do the same as the Phil & Ted's..... But a tandem stroller that was a revolution would be sweet!

This product was very easy to use, quick clean up, and very discrete to carry in public.  My husband and I are constantly using it when we are out with our child.  I especially like the compartment for diaper storage and wipe storage

I use it while my daughter is lying down.  She loves being in the tub.  This just makes her float.  It's great as the get bigger to use like the ring.  Would buy for a friend and totally recommend!

I feel so bad that this seat has such a low ranking. It is perfect for my girl. I do understand why people with boys may have issues, but if you have a girl it is just wonderful. I have a very cheap one that is designed similarly but this one is so much better. It has a great weight to it so it's not flimsy, and it fits my girls bum so nicely, and the cushion is very firm yet soft. The handles make is so easy for her to just climb up on the stool, sit and pull herself back.
My friend has the pricey Bjorn and while that is nice, I saved $15 on something that works just as well

I have a home daycare, so this chair is used constantly. I've had two of these for well over a year, and today I bought a third one. I've tried several different seats in the past and this one is the best by far. Nothing beats the swinging tray. I would recommend it to anyone

We've used this seat when traveling, and everyday use at home.  When our son was about 15 months old, I put the highchair away and started using this.  It can be taken apart easily and put in the dishwaser!!  It folds down so it can be put away easily if you're having guests, unlike a big highchair!  GREAT CHAIR!

We got this chair as a baby shower gift, which I registered for and absolutely love it!  I don't understand the problems the other reviewers are talking about.  If used properly, this chair gives absolutely no problems.  The seat locks in at different levels, if it's not locked in, of course it will fall apart.  

The seat is easy to use, folds easily, and cleans easily.  We store it in our van (we have Stow-and-go storage) and it fits perfectly!

We've used it since my son, now 16 months, could sit up.  He lays his body from side to side and the seat doesn't budge...very safe.  The tray does snap off easily, and he has done that at times while trying to climb up on it.  This doesn't bother me, since it's not a 'toy' and shouldn't be climbed on anyway.  The tray hasn't snapped off while in use, and hopefully won't!  

We've used this chair on both a chair, and the floor when seating was limited (like at family get togethers).  We haven't had any problems at all.

Anyway, I highly recommend it..

This is the best product we have ever used for our little girl (yes that includes swings and bouncy seats). I stumbled across it when they had just come out. She was sitting in it at 4 months. BY the time she started crawiling though we couldnt use it because she was able to twist herslef and climb out of it. However... I see now that they have an attachment for it so it can be used for self feeding. I recommend this to everyone we know who is starting their family or already have had a child. It allows the caregiver to be hands free and it helps your little one learn to be more independant faster (which is a double edged sward! Tough fro parents good for kids).

VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: DOT NOT TURN ON SYSTEM BEFORE READING THIS. 
You have to open up the parent receivers and plug in the battery pack before usage, then Charge the system for 16 hours. DO NOT TURN SYSTEM ON WHILE CHARGING FOR THIS FIRST TIME!!! 

I did a lot of research on monitors and found this one to have pretty good feedback on several parents' websites. With most items, there are pros and cons... see below: 

Pros: 
-You will not pick-up any feedback from the neighbors. This is a significant improvement from monitors in the past. ABSOLUTLY NO INTERFERENCE! 
-Great reception. You will have no problems picking up your child with this. I can take it outside and work in the yard, with confidence that I will know when my baby needs me. 
-Interchangeable AC power cords make it easy to move the system around to different rooms in the house. 
-Lightweight and compact system. 

Cons: 
-The biggest issue is battery life. HORRIBLE BATTERY LIFE, TYPICALLY ONLY 3-4 HOURS at a time! The battery drain on this system is almost a deal breaker in my husband's opinion. This system comes with the options of 1 or 2 docking stations, I HIGHLY RECOMMED the one with two stations because the system is constantly running low on batteries and and can recharge while the parents portion is on the dock. Or the second receiver can be used while the other is charging on the dock. 
-With any power interruption the child's unit shuts off. The parents unit beeps and flashes red to inform you of the issue, but it can be irritating at 2:00 A.M. to have to get up to turn it back on. Graco really needs to find a way to have the system stay on at all times that it is plugged in. 
-Belt clip does not work well with normal amount of movement. The system is better left unattached to belt, unless you want to be constantly picking it up from the ground. 
-A bit expensive.

A little of both... Pros/Cons: 

-Sound: Pro: Great sound, very clear. In fact I can often hear dogs barking outside with this monitor. Con: Picks up on every little sound because it is so sensitive. For the light sleepers, on the softest level still can be very loud. 
-Loud, every 5 seconds, parents warning: Pro: Beeping will let you know that system is not functioning correctly so you can fix the system. This was nice for us one day when the baby's system had fallen and came unplugged. If the system had not beeped, we would not have known. Con: Annoying beeping while searching for signal... a startling fact in the middle of the night. 

*Overall the system does what it should, but there a few area's that could be improved. I gave it 3 1/2 stars but rounded it up.*

We really like our Graco digital iMonitor. It gives very clear sound in a good range of volumes, and has a much longer range than any analog monitors that we tried previously. We do not get quite the range that is claimed on the box--usually it reaches about 1/2 a city block, depending on the strength of charge left in the rechargeable batteries. The lights that light up for baby's sound are quite bright, which can be a problem if you like to sleep in complete darkness. I turn the monitor around so that the lights do not keep me awake

My husband is a NYC doorman so we found it very fitting to decorate our son's room in this theme. Since my hubby deals with taxi's and limo's on a daily basis we thought it was very cute that the main theme of this set had those things in it. We also love Manhattan and are there often so we brought a little bit of it out to our house in L.I. The set is very well made and I like the fact that since it feels like it will last, my son can grown with it. It is also not too pastel and babyish that he can use it well into his toddler and pre-school years

If you are going to get a manual pump, get this one. I got a Medela from the hospital and it was SOOO slow and killed my hand, but this one is way better. It takes 5-10 minutes to get the same amount it took 30 minutes to get with the Medela, and it doesn't hurt your hand at all because you have to pump the handle far less often because of the massaging petals, and because you use it for less time total. I have never used an electric pump so I can't compare it to one of those, but as far as manuals go this one is AWESOME

I have had great success with this manual pump.  

My best advice if you are having trouble is to TAKE OUT THE PETALS!!!  

This helped me immensely.  Milk was getting sucked under the silicone and my I was getting rubbed by the narrowed opening.  I took out the petals and the milk started to flow down into the bottle and pumping became a lot more comfortable and effective.

I used this pump for 2 kids and never had a silicone disk tear on me.  I highly recommend this pump

So far our 7 month old son likes this toy.  He watches the flashing lights, listens to the music and noises, and seems to like the different shaped blocks (we have several other peek-a-boo blocks).  He uses the handle to push the bus, flips up the shape sorter and kicks at the wheels to make the music come on.  It keeps his attention while he practices sitting up for long periods of time.

We thought at first we had a broken one since only one light worked and it didn't flash.  Well after my husband pounded the light bar down on each side both lights came on and started flashing.  It also made the hood stay shut better.  So maybe try that before taking it back to the store if you encounter the same problem

This is a durable and quality product. My son uses it for everything, from turning the lights on to getting on the potty. I use it to reach the pantry and get to all the permanent markers that I must hide from my 2 and a half year old. I must say that I am a hard core fan on Baby Bjorn items as they are durable, classic in design and color. This is a sturdy non-slip item It has supported me for months 120lbs (give or take 10 lbs!) We used it so much that I bought another step stool, made by playskool and I wished I had bought another BabyBjorn

This is so much better than those crappy plastic boosters I can't believe we didn't buy it sooner.  It's easy to clean and doesn't slide off the chair.  Our son fits in it perfectly and now feels like a big boy.  It even has a little carrying bag to take on trips.  Great vendor with quick delivery too

My daughter loves to kick the blankets off during the night and I was always worried that she would get cold, especially with the very cold weather we have had so far this winter. I saw this and knew it would be perfect for my little kicker girl! She wears it every night now and I know she stays warm throughout the night. The only suggestion I have for anyone thinking of buying this, is to make sure you get the right size and length for your little one. Mine is growing so fast that I will have to get a bigger size soon just because she is getting so long

I bought these extensions because I had to have them so that the co-sleeper would fit properly next to my bed.  However, when added the sleeper didn't seem as steady or stable on the floor.  There was a lot more sway in the sleeper with the extensions than without them.  While not a big issue because the sleeper was attached to my bed, I expected something a little more solid or sturdy.

Our little guy was sleeping comfortably in his stroller for the first several months we brought him home. When we tried to transition him to the crib, he was startled by the large space and would cry or sleep very poorly. As he outgrew the stroller, we tried to think of ways to emulate the coziness of the stroller inside his crib (lots of attempts - not an easy task!!). He's 5 1/2 months old and we now use the Sleep Nest in the crib as well as putting him in the larger sized SwaddleMe at night. He loves the closeness and sleeps very soundly. The Sleep Nest is small enough to be cozy, but large enough for him to move comfortably. It fits very nicely into the crib and is also portable which is great since he enjoys being on the go

This doll is attractive, does everything it is supposed to do, comes with appropriate accessories, and above all, children love it. Appears to be well made, with a soft, cuddly body, and our 6 year old granddaughter loves it.

I haven't traveled with the bag yet, but the quality seems good. The bag has a cloth-like exterior and the interior fabric is a thick vinal. My stroller is a pram style one where the handle bar can reverse and is oversized. The stroller fits in the bag with 2 wheels off from the same side because of the thin long ends of the bag (the top thin long end is where the zipper is). They are removable wheels, so its no problem. With all the wheels on, the bag can't zip closed. That is why I gave it only 4 stars. I bought the bag because I will be traveling overseas soon and I don't want my stroller damaged during the long flight.

We purchased this gate to span an opening near the bottom of our stairs and it works very well. We have had this gate in place since my son started crawling and he has yet to breech the perimeter. My husband installed it easily (one end into a stud in the wall, one end into an oak stair banister) and it is sturdy - even with my son frequently shaking it in the middle, it has shown no signs of dislodging. 

I give it 4 stars out of 5 because it is not very attractive and the opening mechanism is somewhat cumbersome (and tough for guests to figure out). But it definitely does its job and I would recommend this gate to anyone with a long span to cover

I can't tell you how much I love this product!!!  I live in Colorado and we've had tons of snow/cold weather this winter and now I can't even imagine zipping my 4-month-old into a snowsuit.  It's so easy to slip her right it, zip it up and go!  I have appreciated the flap that can fold up or down--this covers her head as we walk from our car to the door when it is snowing or windy.  
I chose this urban style over the original because I liked the way it looked, but after having used it a few months there are a few more reasons I like it better.
First, it washes beautifully!  The liner stays soft and looks the same as the day I bought it--unlike sherpa fleece.  Second, the outside fabric is waterproof.  Once I spilled a small soda on the Bundleme and the soda literally beaded up and poured right off!  It never soaked into the fabric and left a stain

I also own the Bundle me w/fluffy heavy winter liner & we could not have lived without it! I was excited to see this trendy,light-weight, weather resistant version for spring. I'll admit I would not have purchased this had it not been on the wrong shelf at $39.99. My $59.99 dismay soon evaporated-it is so sleek and functional!  No more struggling with bulky snowsuits, jackets and sweaters (which never seem to fit baby anyway)  Easily unzips so as not to overheat.  LOVE the little pocket for binky.  Velcro back openings make it easy to switch to stroller (No need to buy two!)

I love this item.  It really works well in February winter weather.  I bought 4 snowsuits and I haven't used one for our newborn because snowsuits are tedious.  I am able to put her in her car seat, put a blanket inside and put a hat on her.  Forget the suits and mittens.  I cover her with the cover and she sleeps in the dark and warmth soundly.  Also, it prevents people from touching her all of the time because they can't see her when I cover her up.  The only problem is that this item didn't fit well with the newest Peg Perego infant car seats.  I made it work, but it doesn't fit perfectly.  It worked with the old Peg Perego car seat, but not the newest one.  I loved this item so much that I've made it work, though.  It isn't perfect, but it works.  It actually is so much better than Peg Perego's cover, which came with the car seat.  This cover has made my life pretty easy.  I found it easy to put on the Peg Perego.  I love the color.  It zips up easily.  It is soft.  Isabella seems to like to snuggle in it.  It is comfy for her.  Be aware, though, I live in Salt Lake City, UT.  Our winters are mild. If you have colder winters, you may want to add a snowsuit.  Still, it is worth the money!  I am glad I bought it.

Well, I'm sure this is probably a novel use for this product, but we bought this for our great dane to sleep on.  He's giant and old and needed more support that the traditional dog bed, but orthopedic giant dog beds STARTED at over $200.  We got the idea to try a baby crib mattress, and ordered it.  Very soon thereafter I arrived home from work and was puzzled to find no dog blocking my way into the door waiting for a head pat; it seemed the mattress had arrived and he was simply immovable.  He loves it.  

It is well crafted and everything the ad said.  Our use is quite unconventional but it works well and we could highly recommnend this for anybody with a large dog

We haven't had any problems cleaning this chair--occasionally we need to use the crevice tool on the vacuum, but that is simple enough.  Most of the time, we simple take a wet paper towel or wet wipe and run it around the seat sides.  (We'd do that with any high chair.) The tray doesn't fit in our dishwasher, but that too has been easy to clean in the sink.  

We love the neutral and plain color of the oatmeal vinyl.  Our daughter is very happy in her chair.  She is only 16 months, but very big for her age she has no problems fitting in this seat at all.  

Our only complaint is that we have to push the tray release handle in when we put the tray on in order to lock it into place or else our daughter can push the tray almost out.  that may be a defect on ours rather than a design flaw--we just live with it since it isn't that big a deal.

This is the BMW of all highchairs.  It's super-sturdy and the Italian leather seat is easy to care for.  Ignore the reviews about being a "pain to clean."  You need to clean EVERY highchair- nooks, crannies, and all.

This diaper bag is a great urban carrier for baby items and can easily pass off as a regular messenger bag for every day use. 

*	It's functional and has multiple organizers, including a place for your cell phone, keys, and a zippered insulated compartment for baby's bottle or a toddler's drink.

*	For parents, there are two inside pockets with zippers that are perfect for wallets and other small items. The interior has easy stash pockets for storing diapers, wipes, and other baby essentials. 

*	Overall, it's a stylish looking bag that moms or dads could use. The design is trendy without having an appearance that will become easily outdated.

*	After nearly two years of daily use, it's still in good condition and shows little signs of wear. 

*	It's also a very convenient on-the-go type bag that stays put when you're out and about

It was nice of my "ninth month wife" to agree upon a diaper bag that I wasn't too embarrassed to carry. Now that the baby's here, I've found it to be functional as well as comfortable; it easily holds enough clothes, diapers and stuff, and doesn't feel like you're carrying an elephant. No complaints at all, it's a great bag

We have had this monitor for about 7 months now and we love it! The peace of mind in being able to see that your little one is okay is priceless. I used to have to run up and down the stairs constantly, and I do not miss that. I can cook dinner or watch a TV show in a relaxed state without worry. It has always worked well, and it something happened to this one we would replace it immediately. The picture is clear, the sound is excellent. You do have to keep charging it if you do not keep it plugged in, but the cords are all generous in length.
We would go nuts without it

It works fantastically for the purposes we purchased it!!  Sometimes there is a little interference, but if you just move the monitor (sometimes moving it even just a couple of inches to the left or right will make a difference) it will work great!  We have had no problems whatsoever and we would definitely buy this monitor again!!  The night vision works great, even in our son's dark room.  The color is great as long as there is sufficient light.

My baby had very bad reflux and pediatrician told us not to move her to her room, my fear was that she would get use to sleep in our bedroom and moving her became a nightmare. When reflux got better at month 4 We finally got to move her and for us this monitor became a very useful tool, it has rechargeable batteries, image and sound are clear enough, night vision works perfect, monitor is not bulky at all (no color at all though), and we managed to tie camera to the crib's headboard and worked great for us.

I have a 6 month old who absoutely loves this walker.  We started using this when he was only 4 months old and being the wiggly, active baby he is, he loved being able to push himself around. Now, along with his "walking", he loves to push the buttons to hear the music and see the lights.  Along with that, he likes to pull and pet the plush toys on the side while "chatting" with them.  This is a great walker; just always remember to keep an eye on baby at all times! I highly recommend this for those babies who love to move around on their own.  It also provides mom and dad with about 25+ minutes of catch-up-with-to-do-list time!!

I purchased the Sesame Beginnings Walker and my daughter loves it. There is a mirror in the middle of the toy bar and she loves to look at herself. It also has big bird and cookie monster figures on each end and she loves to play with them. This walker makes noise and lights up.

There isn't any paint on her walker and I don't know what the other writer was referring to but this walker is very safe and enjoyable for my daughter

I bought this for my second son who is a year old.  I love it.  It's compact and fits easily in the diaper bag.  After he eats, I take it to the restroom and it rinses right off.  I've started using it at home too because the little tray in the front catches food really well (and saves my floors!).  I recommend anyone who hates to see their child rub their food all over the germy table buy this!!

I was really nervous about this product after reading the reviews, but once I put the organizer up it was great. I use the top four slots for thing like mittens and cotton balls and the next two for wipes and larger lotion and bath items. The bottom is really good for several diapers. I love it!!!

I love the Baby Bjorn bib- it is excellent for protecting my 1 year old son's clothes as he learns to feed himself.  It is great for car rides too - I can place Cheerios in the pocket and he can feed himself a little snack.  

The only drawback is that with my son being small, the highchair tray and the pocket are the same height.  However, as he grows taller, they won't interfere with each other

I gave birth to a premature infant that had to spend a week in the NICU.  Because of that I was forced to establish my milk supply w/ a breastpump.  The morning after I gave birth my husband went Walmart to pick up some of things that we hadn't purchased.  I called him crying and told him that he had to find something for my sore nipples.  Well this is what he brought back.  The relief was instantaneous. I bought a couple more boxes as my daughter "learned" to breastfeed.  I use another of their nipple creams for everyday use(they're too expensive to use everday), but I make sure that there is always a box of these in my cabinet!

I received this monitor as a gift and it has been a life saver. How nice that I can monitor my baby's every move and sound without being in the same room every minute!  The are two different channels, so this usually cuts out the extra static or the alarm going off. Sometiems it's also just a matter or re-positioning the monitor to resolve the noise. 
We were suprised one evening when we picked up what sounded like a phone conversation between two girls, but switching to channel B solved that. 
I've used the Evenflo Whisper Connect for about 3 months now and am quite satisfied

I own this seat for my son who is age 6. It is the law in my state that children must in a booster or car seat until age 8. The seat material is high quality and the cushioning is very comfotable. The headrest is perfect for long trips since my son can fall asleep without an annoying crick in his neck. The price is decent too.

The only issue I have with this seat is the cupholders. If you have a regular sedan and want to fit others in your car, the cupholders aren't very usable. Additionally, the cupholders don't slide out very well when the child is sitting in the seat. Personally, I leave the cupholders pushed in. I have another carseat for a young infant in my sedan and must fit my 10-year old in the back seat. 

I wish carseat and booster seat makers would instead make a mesh bag pocket hang right off the botton front for kid toys and such. Furthermore, with booster seats in general, I think they are very impractical for families who need to fit 3 kids across the backseat. My son has a very hard time buckling his seat belt because he must reach to the side where space is at a premium.

I would love a forward-facing booster seat with a 5-point harness that would lock into the LATCH loops for the older child. Not only is a 5-point seat harness safer but it is much easier for a child to buckle themselves instead of reaching around to the side.

As far as the options available for a child who has outgrown a convertible seat but is too small for a regular seat belt, this is a nice option.

As most of the other reviewers, I live in a small townhome.  This chair is wonderful.  It takes up very little space and is so easy to clean.  I remove the straps and throw them in the wash and they come out so clean.  The rest of the chair is very easy to wipe clean and the tray just gets put in the dishwasher.  Despite carrots, prunes, etc. being mashed into it, the tray hasn't stained at all.  I recommend this chair to all my pregnant friends

I purchased your "Space Saver Highchair" for my 9 month old daughter who is severely disabled. Finding equipment for the very young disabled child is very difficult.  This chair works for everything!  This chair is so comforatable for my daughter and allows her to sit up and play with her toys as she gets very bored laying on her back all day.  She also has a very difficult time playing with her toys as her grasp is not well controlled and she is constantly dropping toys on her face or off to the side and cannot get them back in her hand. I love this chair for its size, the way the whole seat tilts (not just the back), and the 5 point harness.  The chair is also small so it holds her very nicely.  My daughter loves nothing more than to sit in this chair all the time

I received this stroller about a week ago, and so far, we love it.  The ride is smooth, it's very light, and I love the salmon color.  The shade comes in handy, too.  It has all the features I'd want while still remaining ight and streamlined.  It's a little awkward to close, but I'm a bit of a klutz, so I assume others might not have this problem.  The handles are great, though, and they're very comfortable for my husband (6 feet) and me (5'7".)

Lightweight, high-quality construction. We are very pleased with it, and our 1.5yr girl just loves it.  The carrying strap is a very convenient addition. Don't waste your money on a $20 umbrella stroller, spend a little more and enjoy the high quality of this excellent stroller

I was looking for a decent sized, sectioned plate for my 1 year old to have at the dinner table and these were perfect.  I have not used them to travel with but I do not think the lids would stay on the plates very well in that type of setting.  They do work great for her leftovers though when I put them in the fridge.  They are nice and slim and fit well into long skinny areas.

I had my doubts when we first used it b/c it closes with just some toggle-like buttons and i was worried that the wind would slip through.  But my baby comes out of this stroller-sleeping-bag/wrap warm every time.  And we've had a few days this winter here in the Northeast that have been way below freezing with a wind chill strong enough to sting your face.

I actually had put this on my daughter's wish list and then broke down and bought it myself for her because I just couldn't wait to see if she'd get it for her 1st birthday.  I always take tubbies with my daughter so I like to have fun toys in the tubby that I enjoy too.  My daughter loves her out-of-water xylophone and thinks this one is pretty neat too - I have to admit I play with it more than she does at this point.  She's only 9-1/2 months right now so I think as she gets a bit older she'll enjoy it more.  My only complaint, and the reason I didn't give it 5 stars, it should come with more play sheets and they are NOT waterproof.  Other than that, a fun toy.  After I got this, I did find it at Target for the same price it's listed here with no s&h charges but still don't regret getting it.

This seems to be a decent changing pad with the exception of it not being easy to clean. I am having a real hard time cleaning it and never had this problem with other changing pads. It's almost porous! If you get this changing pad, plan on having a cover on it at all times to keep it clean.

It works great for me. I have 2 floor + 2 kids + 2 cats and before I didn't know what going on in my house. Now I can hear any sound - guests coming, kids playing/watching TV and even when cats jump on dining table to steel some food.
It makes some fone sound on max volume, but I don't care - I just reduse volume or change unit position. I strongly recomend this Monitor

We were downstairs one night watching TV and kept hearing crickets.  Turns out her bedroom window was open and we were hearing the crickets through the baby monitor. This thing is so good, I can hear crickets in the backyard from one story up. There is no doubt I can hear anything my daughter needs. I can tell from her cry through the monitor whether I need to prep or bottle, get a diaper ready, or its time for play.

Every mother/father should definitely purchase a baby monitor. Until this came I could not leave my baby while she slept to go do the dishes and what not. The receiver side is battery operated, so even if I walk around the house I can here my baby. Even the smallest sound is picked up! Amazing. I haven't tried other monitors, but this one is perfect and inexpensive, so I would recommend it to anyone

It is hard when you have an infant to secure them in their car seat with a huge snowsuit on. I found myself dredding going out because my daughter would look like an eskimo in her car seat.  I was delighted when I found the Urban Me Bundle.  I don't have to worry about bundling her up in heavy gear when we go out.  We just put on her hat and go.  The Urban Me Bundle gives your child enough breathing room as well as providing warmth and comfort.  It helps too that it is rain resistant.  I have received many compliments on my Urban Me Bundle and found it to be a wise investment. It really doesn't compare to the other ones that are on the market because you can definitely see the difference in quality of the fabric inside and out

Out of all the loads of baby gear I bought- this is by far the best money I spent.  I thought, its a little spendy, but super cute.  After my preemie came home the 3rd week of November and it was 27 degrees... I realized how great this thing was.  Its super snuggly for her and keeps her warm.  No need for a jacket that would mess up her straps!  also in the wind and the rain, to just be able to flip it over her face is so great!  This is way better that the ones with sherpa inside in my opinion.  My daughter will be able to use it well into Spring.  Not to mention, not a day goes by that I don't get a compliment on the sack and people asking where I got it.  Love it Love it

It took no time to figure out how to use this seat.  My daughter meets the minimum height and weight requirements, so I am moving here from a 5 point harness Britax to this booster in a second car.  The seat is easy to install and remove, and also easy to stowe in the trunk when not in use by simply pulling the rear latch and folding.  I can definately see using it for travel on planes, as it is easy to fold and light enough to carry.  My daughter also likes the fold out cup holders for water.  They are sturdy and easy to tuck back in when storing or carrying the seat.  Highly recommended.

I have taken and posted a picture to show what Luke and I carry in this bag.  We luckily have not had any ripping or stitching problems.

We have a recieving blanket, cell phone, first aid kit (in the ziplock at top of pic) burts bees baby lotion, oil and diaper rash ointment, 3 diapers, bag of wipes, bib, onsie, sleeper, burp cloth, 2 toys, hat, and 3 empty ziplocks to hold dirty diapers, clothes that have ahd to be changed or trash.  What is not in the picture is the camera that goes in the middle compartment because that took the picture.  My cannon S2 powershot goes in the middle compartment!  

We don't have anything in the bottle container, but that is where we stuff dirty diaper and clothes ziplocks and there is nothing in the larger front pocket, so we have room to spare.
Excellent design and as other reviewrs have noted the colors are great in person.

This is a great bag for day hikes and outings with dad.  And it has held up great for us so far

In my months of 'experimentation' and a few purchases in err, this is the best product of its sort out there.

It's the ONLY product I've purchased (or tried out in the store) that truly requires only ONE hand!  With my 8 month old on my shoulder, I drop this bag into the cart seat, I unzip it flip the 'diaper pocket' over the back, pull the generous, elastic edged cover up and over the cart handle and that's just about it.

Additionally, the Buggy Bag is among the few that covers the whole cart, and (uniquely) adds further protection from germs with 2 separate belts: one to go around your child's waist, the other to secure it to the cart.

Not to be forgotten: the Buggy Bag comfortable (apparently!), has simple convenient storage options and stores itself w/ ease!

On the other hand, I tried one imitation in a popular Baby store and not only did it not open with one hand (a necessity with a baby on your hip in a grocery store parking lot!) but I could NOT get it back into its 'carrying' shape with two hands!!  I hid it on the shelf and moved away quickly.  eek.  Another product I purchased online came in two pieces and had so many clips and belts wrapping it together, that I could barely attach it with both hands and help from passersby. While it had 'shoulder straps unlike any other, they dont work in most carts that put an advertising placard on the back of the cart seat.  Finally adjusted, that product (the "Shop'n'Dine") didnt cover most of the cart. (on its debut shopping trip) I threw it back in the car and went home, too tired to shop.

Finally, there are lots of imitators out there, dont be suckered in by similar names, better price points or preferred fabric choices:  the Buggy Bag will preserve your sanity and, perhaps, your child's health.

We've had this toy for around 3 years now.  My second child loves playing with it as much as my firstborn!  It is also a hit with other children visiting our house.  The toy is as educational as it is fun!  We've used it to practice colors, shapes, and musical creativity.  It can get a little pricey as the cartridges to expand the set run ~$20 new.  All in all a FANTASTIC toy well worth the price!  Another upside is how friendly and helpful the Neurosmith company is.  We lost a block and they were friendly and helpful with the replacement.

My friend finally broke down and bought this for her 2 kids because they also loved it so much

This 2-in-1 is amazing.  The scent is wonderful...too bad they don't make it for adults :)  A very gentle cleanser that can be used for babies and toddlers alike.  It actually cleans the skin and leaves it soft and smelling beautifully.  I love Mustela products so much that I got rid of every other product that I had that wasn't Mustela.  Fifteen donated bottles later the only products that still remain in our home are these products.  Try them and you'll see why

We have these straps all over our house (on every piece of furniture taller than two feet), because we have two "climbers." There have been two occasions that I know of where these saved my eldest daughter from injury, as she climbed large pieces of furniture. 

The hardest part of installing these is finding them. We searched several local stores, with little luck - and a few odd looks, as salespersons didn't understand why we would want to strap our furniture to the walls when we don't live in an earthquake zone. But trust me, once you find somewhere that sells them, buy them up. Once you see how well they work, you will become addicted to testing to see if you can tip your furniture - and will want them everywhere.

Before realising that there actually was such a thing as a car seat carrier, my husband and I used to stuff our car seat into plastic garbage bags and tape them shut. It kept the seat clean (and we even had plenty of airline staff commend us on even thinking to bag our seat to keep it clean), but obviously did nothing to make it easier to tote around the airport.

Then I found out about car seat carriers, and chose this one as it had the most favourable reviews. It was purchased just before a trip to Colorado, and has since also been to Europe and back. 

I'm extremely happy with this item. It's relatively easy to put our convertible Evenflo car seat into, and the canvas and zippers have held up well, with no obvious signs of wear yet, even after braving the luggage belts.

The only tip I can give people is that my husband and I found that the car seat has a tendency to wobble or tip over more when pulled in a more upright position (much like small wheelie carry on luggage), and was more stable to pull when you had it leaning backward quite far, so that it's center of gravity is lower. So you might need/be able to use the strap that comes with it or something else to attach to the handle so that you have some extra length to tip it back further. Both my husband and I were a little too tall for just the handle to do that comfortably. 

For anyone looking for a way to more easily take their carseat along, I definitely recommend this product

As im sure all mothers can relate, my 9mo old son is always trying to eat the shopping cart. I looked at a lot of local stores for a cover. I couldnt find one that fully covered the front back and sides of the seat that wasnt $80. This one is great! its reasonably priced, wonderful bright colors and holds up well after several washings. i just wish it wasnt so bulk to carry around, but i guess thats the price you pay to keep him from sucking who knows what up off the carts!!

I bought this for my reluctant potty-trainer, and he's used it once and tried to go in it several times, but the real blessing has been his 6-year-old brother using it. I have one bathroom, and one very messy boy who never lifts the toilet seat. This has saved me from having to clean my toilet seat constantly or face unwelcome surprises. I do have to check the collection reservoir a lot, though, because my older son does "go" a lot, as big boys will. The flushing mechanism works well and is a necessary part - it saves a lot of time you may spend scrubbing and rinsing a traditional training potty. Plus, the pee collects in a part of the potty the child doesn't have easy access to, unlike a trainer potty that they can pee in, then stand up and step in or put on their head when your back is turned for a second (I speak from experience). Makes it much more sanitary.

The only problems I've encountered are my kids flushing it constantly (mostly when it was new), simultaneously filling the collection reservoir and draining the water and therefore creating two jobs for me to repeat every five minutes, the fact that my three-year-old still can't quite get it that he can't sit on it and do #2, and the fact that it's just a little off-balance, so unless you wall-mount it or lean it up against a wall, you could have an icky mess. Luckily, ours has only fallen over when filled with water

I had one of these with my second son and loved it.  We just kept it in his car seat and it made it so easy to cover him up when necessary.  When it was hot out we could uncover him, and when we went into somewhere with air-conditioning we would just cover him up.  It is soft and cozy.  We found it so convenient.  We will be purchasing another one for number three, who's due in May.

This lamp is so much cuter than I was expecting. The quality looks excellent.  I looked at cheaper lamps and you get what you pay for.  The quality of this lamp is definitely superior to others.

This is the absolute cutest general neutral baby bedding set out there.  The colors are fabulous, the material is soft and nice, and I was SO pleased by its overall quality.  We also purchased some of the extras, (the lamp, pillow, and wall hangings) and were just as pleased.  I would reccommend this bedding to any person expecting a child that doesn't wish to know the gender before it's born, but also any parent that does know, be assured, it is great for a girl or boy, especially if you like animals!!

I havent had any problems with the bottles leaking like others have stated, but I guess I always check and make sure the lid is on right.  The suction isnt too fast, which is great.  My baby doesnt get choked.  She latches easily to the nipple since it is the same as the pacifier that she loves.  My only gripe is that since the bottles are so wide they cover the whole lower part of her face and it smooshes her nose.  There isnt a curve in the bottle, so when the milk gets low you either have to lean the baby back more, which I dont like, or either mash the bottle on her nose.  Its avoidable, but I tend to do it whithout realizing sometimes.  Id rather just stick with a bottle like playtex with a curver or a bottle that is slimer.  I still use the bottles, but I just have to make sure the whole time I'm feeding that it isnt mashing her nose so she can breath

We adopted a little boy when he was 2 days old.  He was slightly preemie and weighed just over 5 pounds.  He wouldn't have anything to do with the soothie for preemies, but loved the regular soothie pacifier even though it covered half his face.    We had a hard time finding a bottle that he liked, he didn't seem to care for any of the nipples and we tried several: avent, dr. brown, gerber and playtex.  I was strolling the baby aisle in Target when I saw these and was thrilled.  In the store the 3 pack of 5 oz bottles was half of what they are here on amazon.  I love the width of the bottles because it's super easy to add in formula and make sure everything is really clean.  The lid also snaps onto the bottom which helps keep them from mysteriously disappearing.

Our baby is now 8 weeks old and these are still doing well.  This bottle has really cut down on the amount of mess our baby makes when eating also.  Double check to make sure the top is on tight and you shouldn't have any leaking problems.  I'm so glad I found these!

I tried several different bottles, including Avent and Second Nature, and this is the only one that my baby could get a good suction on and didn't flow too fast or make her gag. The nipples are the same as the pacifier given to me at the hospital (which is the only pacifier she will take as well). I am breastfeeding, and with all of the trouble I was having findnig a bottle, I was worried about what would happen when I went back to work and my baby had to be fed from a bottle. This bottle has eased my mind. Also, the wide neck make washing easier than any other bottles. The reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because it will leak if the top is not on really tight, but as long as I make sure it is tight I have no problems

I bought this stroller after having a 7 year old peg perego hand me down. I loved the old one but it looked like it had one thousand miles on it, as a friend told me so I gave it to my mom to use. I knew it was important to get a good stroller that would last rather than buying cheap ones. I am a very price sensitive, I shop at consignment shops, etc and I still feel the money spent is worth it!

The reason I like this stroller:

1. You can guide it with one hand.
2. There is a spot for bags, etc underneath. 
3. The cup holder for mommy and child. (this is an extra accessory)
4. It's lightweight and you can pop it open and closed easily. 
5. The five point harnes

For the price how can you go wrong, it is absolutely FULL FEATURED, besides a lot of features of the stroller itself, you get a uv shade cover, a raincover, and a cover for the legs (the boot; useful when it is cold). Easy to open and close, a breeze to push, I can even manage with one hand, baby is happy in it.  Only wish it could recline with one hand. The two buttons you have to press to recline the stroller, get a bit stuck on ours, but maybe 'cos it is new. Even if I knew that would happen, I still would buy this stroller, it is something I can live with. It is almost half the price of the 2007 models, which only differ from the 2006 in color and fabric. The color though is not really what I expected from a teal, it is more of a dirty blue

I bought 3 packages of Dr. Brown's (through AMAZON.COM) standard size nipples and I received 2 standard and 1 wide.  They shipped the wrong item to me.  I returned the wide to the address in Calabasas, California and have not received and feedback that they received it or any refund for the product as well as the postage to send the wrong item back to RIGHT START.  I enjoy using this product for my child because it is the only one that works for him.  Since my purchase, I still have not received anything except this email from AMAZON.COM.  I rate the product 5 stars but the service 1 star

I bought this when my daughter was 2 weeks old and it is simple to use and extremely helpful for sleep deprived mothers. With the touch of one button, I can keep track of how long it has been since I fed my baby. I don't use the sleep or diaper timers but this is worth it for the feeding timer alone. The first unit I was sent was defective and I received terrific customer service when I contacted the company. I am rating with 4 stars instead of 5 only because I'd like to be able to keep track of the daily total feedings as well. Maybe a future model

This timer system is beyond helpful - it becomes your BRAIN when you have a newborn, as the hours, feedings and diaper changes become a total blur during this amazing yet totally sleep deprived time of your life.  While it would be nice to have a few more features like total ounces drank, whether the diaper was a wet one or a doodie, and tracking of daily totals for everything - that'd be more of a infantcare PDA, and is a bit beyond the scope of this little device.  All it aims to be is a timer that will keep track of the key stats in your baby's life, consequently making your life way easier.  I wake up in middle of the night and the baby is grunting, for example.    I click the backlight button and see that in fact the baby has only been asleep for an hour, and had a diaper and bottle right before that.  Then I just go back to sleep.  On the other hand, he beguns grunting and making noises and I see the Itzbeen says it's been 2 hours 30 minutes since his last bottle or diaper, and I know it's time to get up and feed him.

It's also great for team caregiving, as my husband can hand me the Itzbeen after doing his morning shift, and I automatically know when the last change and bottle were.  We use the wildcard button to track bottle expirations too.

Thumbs up for the developers of this cool gadget - I hope to see an "Itzbeen II" w/ some advanced features in time for my next baby - although keeping it simple does help keep it easy and quick to use, especially in the fog of a 1am, 3am, and 5am feeding schedule!  (my son never got the memo that full term babies are only supposed to eat every 3 or 4 hours :

The Snuggle Nest gave my husband and I peace of mind while co-sleeping with our son.  I thought about purchasing the Arm's Reach Co-sleeper but my son wanted to be REAL close to us through the night.  Our son is ten weeks old and it still works.  It is cumbersome when trying to nurse because you have to sit up and pull the baby out and after a Cesarean that proved to be a little difficult.  I'm hoping the transition to his crib will be easy with the Snuggle Nest by putting the Snuggle Nest into his crib.  The little light is helpful when trying to get my son to latch on during nursing or chaning diapers in the middle of the night (the bedside light wakes my husband.

We had an old wooden cradle for the newborn. The Snuggle Nest made it snuggly, warm and comfy. However, it didn't work in our bed (queen size) because it was big and bulky. If you plan on using it in your bed buy "inclined to sleep" with positioners. Babies'R'Us sells it now. It's easier to move the sleeping baby from and to your bed when in inclined to sleep.

I am nursing our 2 wk old, and it is just easier for me if our baby sleeps with us.  My husband is always worried he will roll over on the baby, so, he does not sleep well.  The snuggle nest has given him peace of mind and now he can sleep.  Also, the DVD has made him more comfortable taking care of the baby by himself, because he feels confident that he can calm our baby down without my help.  I only wish we would have bought this with second child

I've tried other cart covers and this one is the nicest.  It's big and, well, floppy!   It's padded so it keeps my son comfortable. You can put it on the cart with one hand.  I have to put my son in and then do the seat belt through the back.  It works great.  We leave it in the car and use it everywhere.  I bought it because when my  other son was a baby he got really sick a few days after a trip to the grocery store.  I've seen programs about what's on those cart seats (people put their raw meat in that section of the cart all the time - yuck)  I feel much safer now!!

Our Hungry Pelican is now on child number three and shows no signs of wear despite being a favorite crib toy for many years.  

The bright yellow velour pelican ties onto the crib railing.  His fat cheeks squeak, his wings crinkle, and his feet rattle.  He comes with four sea creatures (crab, shrimp, fish, and octopus) that are each different textures and colors, and make different sounds (rattle, rustle, etc.).  Children can put the little animals into pelican's mouth and watch them drop down into his tummy.  The large circular tummy opening allows for easy removal of the animals so play can begin all over again.

I found that babies enjoy quietly investigating the sounds, colors, and textures of the four little sea creatures.  Toddlers progress to the eating game.

I am grateful to Mr. Pelican for allowing me an extra half hour of sleep every morning.  What can be better than that!

The fastest way to KNOW your plastic baby wares are CLEAN!  I love these bags.  Note, I use two bags simultaneously in the microwave to knock out my cleaning faster, since there are limits to how many items you can put in each bag without warping.

You do need to get any smudgy or residue like material off the plastic item BEFORE steaming it for best results.

Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend this product, it has been a lifesaver to me

I only occasionally feed my baby, and my apartment doesn't have a dishwasher. I usually decide right before going out that I want to take a bottle, so this disinfects everything really quick - in 3 minutes. As opposed to boiling it in a pot of water for 20 minutes. ANd I don't use it every days, so I don't see the point in keeping everything sterlized cuz I would have to sterilize it again right before using.

I heard about these blankets from a co-worker and had to order the mommie blanket for me and the pink baby blanket for my daughter. They are the softest blankets I've ever felt. There's a reason this company's name is CloudB! The only reason I gave this blanket 4 stars is because of the quality of the sewing - the mommie velboa blanket arrived with lots of loose threads hanging off the edges. Not a big deal, I just snipped them with a scissors, but still disappointing to get such a beautiful blanket but have it look a little unfinished.

I bought this pump about 6 weeks after my son was born and I love it.  He's 5 months old now and I have used it while working since he was 3 months old without any problems.  I have to pump in the ladies room where I work, but this pump is so quiet that no one knows what I'm doing.  I work 10 hour shifts, so I pump quite a bit, but this pump is so easy to use that I don't have the hand/wrist pain that I've had with other manual pumps.  
Overall, the bag is stylish and discreet, the bottles are fabulous (no nipple confusion problems) and I have not had any problems with any part of it.  The only thing I would suggest to someone looking to purchase one of these is to acquire additional ice packs if you can't keep your milk in the fridge.  I had to buy two more solid ice packs to keep my milk cold all day.  Otherwise, I have no complaints.  Excellent product and service

I LOVE my Avent pump. Even though I knew I would be returning to work when my son was just 6 weeks old, I was reluctant to spend the money on an expensive electric pump until I knew if breastfeeding would be right for us. Now, my son is almost 6 months old and I'm still using my manual pump. I take 2 15-minute breaks each day and find that I can easily keep up with my son's milk needs. On the days that I have trouble getting my milk to flow, I find that it has much more to do with my stress level than the pump's efficieny. (On those nights, I nurse on one side while I pump on the other.) I would definitely recommend this pump as a great value for the price

It's a great manual pump, but it's just a manual pump after all. Manually pumping both breasts one at a time takes more than twice as long as double electric pumping to get the same amounts of milk. It would be impossible for me to keep pumping at work if I had to take that much time out of every work day. However I do keep this pump in my desk drawer for emergencies (like the time I forgot my other pump at home) or for out-of-office meetings (because it's small and discrete). It's also great for occasional home use or for women who need to leave the house with a pump every once in a while. I'm giving it 4 stars because I don't think it should be advertized for use at a full time job

I love this containers.  First of all, I am a big fan of the Isis Breast Pump, so these containers are perfect for me.  I express into these containers--freeze them--thaw them out--replace the sealing disc with the nipple--warm it up.  Then my husband is ready to feed the baby.  It's one of their times together, and I get to spend time with my older children.  Perfect

I use the Medela pump - but their thin bottles and simple caps don't seem like they have the ability to keep the milk fresh. I love the heavy Advent bottles and the caps have a rubber ring in them to really seal the bottle

I love my new stroller.  I also have a Graco travel system.  The Graco was just way to big and heavy for me to handle.  I think the Peg steers very well, unlike what some other reviewers have said.  I even set up an obtacle course in the store I bought it at to make sure that I could steer it one handed with my 1yr old in it.  It handled like a dream.  My husband and I went to the mall last weekend and were waiting for an elevator, instead of waiting in the long line, my husband carried our 1yr old, and I carried the stroller up the stairs while it was fully opened.  It was a breeze!  We did the same thing when we left the mall, only this time I collasped the stroller, the carrying handle on it makes it super easy to carry up or down stairs.  It's still winter, so I haven't had much of a chance to test out the sun shade, but hopefully that will work out ok.  I would reccomend this stroller to anyone, infact I've told two of my girlfriends about it, and they have already added it to their gift registry.  You will be happy with this stroller

If your looking for a no frills chair this is the one.  I didn't find it terribly difficult to put together but was suprised at how well made the tray and seating area is.  I didn't want to spend a whole lot of money on a highchair being the fact that my older kids when they were big enough they would rather sit on a booster seat.  It does recline but I keep the seat in the upright for my 6 month old.  She seems to like it better that way.

 The only thing I would complain about is I don't care for the way the belt is.  I may be using it incorrectly (at least it seems like that) but it holds the baby (and that's what it's meant for)

The review before this one is what got me interested with this produce and so I decided to buy it and let me tell you, it was the best choice ever. I have no real experience with any other wipes, but have read reviews of all the promes other have given like wipes dry out or turn color...THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN WITH THIS ONE. I love that I just put the whole pack in, plastic and all, and it stays nice and toasty for my son's bottom. He loves it and no longer has to deal with cold wipes anymore. I love the spring inside to keep the wipes on top. I love that it heats from the top. The wipes never turn yellow and is ALWAYS moist. I also love the little handle on the top, so I just have to pull the plug and easily carry it to another room if need be! The product is hight recommended

 I tried several types of bottles when supplementing nursing. Even the Playtex nursers which I liked with my older children caused gas and fussiness with my son. I had received a free Avent nurser, so I tried it and the problem was eliminated. I bought the newborn set and some extras, not cheap, but worth it for a content baby! I was quite upset when they began leaking, then I discovered that unlike other bottles that leak if you don't tighten as much as possible, if you tighten Avent fully and then loosen by about a half turn, they don't leak! No gas, no leaks, happy baby

I wanted this set since I saw it in Babies-r-us, but it was so much more expensive. This is perfect for my new baby girl. I always loved Hello Kitty and I hope she will too. Also, there are many cute accessories that you can purchase with this set. The lamp, rug, and mobile are a must! =) The set comes with only one window valance, and as my nursery has 2 windows, I had to purchase an additional valance. Just something to keep in mind when buying this

This nursery care kit is great!  Before buying another care kit consider the following points, with the time and frustration you will save... you'll be glad you did.  The first week home from the hospital I used the nasal aspirator countless times.  It is very gentle but very effective.  The digital thermometer is quick and easy to use.  So much better than the glass and mercury kind.  The medicine spoon and dropper are very clearly marked so you know exactly how much you are giving your baby.  The nail clippers are curved so they can cut better with less chance of cutting your baby's finger.  Anyone that has ever cut their baby's  finger while trimming their nails will appreciate that!  The items in this kit are small and compact and very easy to store.  Great to keep in your diaper bag for when you're on the go

This is a great price for a 4 pc set. (I got ours at walmart for $35) The comforter is not thick and plushy.  Its very thin and stiff.  But then again, for the price, its ok.  The sheets are adorable.  We bought a very soft, fuzzy Dora blanket to go with it.  But the comforter that comes with it is definately cute.  Maybe after a few washes it will soften up some.  I would still buy it again for the price.  But if you are looking for a thick, soft warm comfoter, then this is not the one you want

I purchased this booster seat with the intention of using it on our upcoming vacation only, but it has come in very handy while visiting family and friends as well. It is easy to set up and take down and is very compact when folded. My son weighs 16 pounds and my nephew weighs approximately 25 pounds; both have used it and neither one seemed uncomfortable in any way.
We've only used it a handful of times so far, but I can't think of one bad thing to say about it. We're very pleased with our purchase

I bought these strap covers:
1. because my daughter's neck was being rubbed raw by the straps of her Snugride, and
2. because I could get them in PINK and she would no longer be confused for a boy all the time!
This product solved both problems.  When I took them out of the packaging and realized how BIG they were I was pretty concerned that my daughter would be uncomfortable even though they are really soft.  Luckily, she adapted easily to them and I think she even likes having them there because she can kind of chew on it and they also hold her head up like a travel pillow when she falls asleep in her carseat

This is a great item, but, it does have some flaws. I got this for my 2 month old, and he loved it! Now he's 6 months and loves it just as much. The thing is, you need to manually push the button, and then you can use the remote. After it plays all the music, and it shuts off, the only way to turn it back on, is to press the button yourself. Not great when you're flying on the freeway! But, it still seems to calm my baby as soon as the music goes on

I have a 7 week old baby and this is the only bag we have used, thus far.  I can carry my baby in a sling on the front and this bag slung over my back at the same time.  It seem quite rugged, and holds a ton! I can carry 4 newborn diapers or 2 cloth diapers, a travel wipes container, a small changing pad, a couple of spare onsies, a nursing shawl, 2 washcloths for spit up, an extra receiving blanket, a 4 oz bottle of cleanser, phone, lipstick, keys and wallet, and that is only in the main compartments.  The only proplem I've had was that the fastener on the bottle holder came off before I had even used the bag, but I was able to fix it.  I may want a bigger bag when she starts needing toys and food to come along, but for now, this is perfect

I am one of those people who used to think horrible things about people who put their kids on leashes.  Then I became mom to a very busy and independent little girl who started walking at 9 months.  I bought the Harness Buddy for a cruise we were taking when my daughter was 16 months.  I couldn't imagine trying to keep up with her on the ship and she will not sit in a stroller for an extended period of time.  The first time we used it I started having images of her reacting like what happens when you put a cat on a leash, but she loved it.  She enjoys her freedom even if it is limited by the leash.  I cannot tell you how many people have commented on how cute it is!  It is so soft and cuddly.  We now use it in the mall and have seen more and more people with the same Harness Buddy.  Oh, and I think the fact that she is getting exercise instead of sitting in the stroller is fantastic.  We love it!

I love the 5 point harness.  My daughter needed to get out of the car seat but still need more than a seat belt.  This seat was easy to install and we love it

We got our Maclaren stroller a few weeks ago.  We love it.  My husband and I are both tall ~ me 5'7" and him 6'1".  Both of us can use this stroller without slouching or kicking the wheels when we walk.  The stroller folds and unfolds easily and maneuvers beautifully. I highly recommend this stroller to anyone who is taller and wants a convenient stroller.

Our $10 piece of junk umbrella stroller (you know the one) bit the dust on a 10 day trip to Europe so in a bit of emergency we got this one at Harrod's in London, and about had a cow paying 60 pounds for this exact stroller. Turns out it's the best one we could have gotten and the price was right. You can't go wrong. It's sturdy, well-balanced, super easy to fold up and carry around (sling it over your shoulder--it's that light) and has a nice larger sun/rain shield (ours happened to come with a rain cover as well, but this was in London and I don't know if this US version comes with it automatically). The color orange is great for boys or girls and bright enough for pedestrian/traffic awareness. Love it. Like many people, with two kids we calculated that we've gone through half a dozen strollers over the past 8 years (how does that happen?! car seats, too) and this is the best so far. Go for it

This new Maclaren stroller is fantastic! We just returned from three weeks in France with this great stroller.  It can roll down an aisle on an airplane and negotiate the rocks and bumps of any street. It is very light and we love the new shoulder strap.  I have 3 kids and this is the best stroller I have ever used

I tried several different bottles, including Avent and Second Nature, and this is the only one that my baby could get a good suction on and didn't flow too fast or make her gag. The nipples are the same as the pacifier given to me at the hospital (which is the only pacifier she will take as well). I am breastfeeding, and with all of the trouble I was having findnig a bottle, I was worried about what would happen when I went back to work and my baby had to be fed from a bottle. This bottle has eased my mind. Also, the wide neck make washing easier than any other bottles. The reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because it will leak if the top is not on really tight, but as long as I make sure it is tight I have no problems

I was able to put this dresser together by myself and I was 6 months pregnant.  The overall look is beautiful.  A great buy for the money.  I did buy the fabric railing protectors from babies-r-us to protect the round railings from a teeting baby since it is made of pine and they fit perfectly

I know that after looking at the price tag, one might be confused why I say economical; however, when you only need one wipe to do the job that would take 3 wipes with other brands (for those exploding messes) - they are a value.  These wipes have the right amount of wetness to them to clean an area thoroughly with one wipe  most of the time.  Of course they smell amazing and are the softest wipe I've ever seen.  I have only positive remarks for these wipes

I installed this today though I haven't used it that much yet but the quality seems very good and it seems very sturdy. I was afraid it might not be sturdy and safe from looking at the photo, but after getting it and installing it, it seems pretty sturdy and safe to me. It also comes with a seat beat to keep the child secure in the seat. I'm giving the chair five stars because I can't think of anything negative about it

I wanted to respond to the other review.  If you choose to purchase window coverings from this set instead of making them or getting them elsewhere, please know that the curtains are a darker stripe (not the tan plaid).  But they do match the ruffle on the diaper stacker, the border on the wall hangings and quilt, the trim on the hamper, etc.  It is not as if there would be this one item with an odd color or pattern

My husband and I ordered these pictures for our sons nursery. Our theme is Barn Yard, we also got the coordinating lamp, light-plate switch and night light. These pictures really help to complete the room. 
The delivery time was slow (pictures arrived two days after set date) but they were definately worth waiting for! They appear to be actual canvas and acrylic art-work. 
I would recommend these to anyone who is looking for the perfect picture to complete their nursery!

this seat caught my attention because of the higher weight and height capacity, 29 inches and 22lbs but this seat is also very well made the padding is exceptional compared to evenflo and graco every where is padded the head rest has additional egg shock support and it comes with an additional body pillow for newborns ,until the pillow gets snug and you have to remove it.my daughter was 13lbs and 8 ounces and 25 inches at her 4 month old wellbaby check up in june ,now six months old she still fits and is not hanging out at all.i have to wonder if the previous reviewer removed the body pillow .it does get snug and then you have to use the seat without the pillow.why not five stars ?the instructions are bad the seat is much easier to install without the base.but a good seat overall

I cringe at the idea that I fed my baby from heated up polycarbonate bottles. I might not be able to breastfeed my baby, but with my new glass bottles, at least I know that I am feeding her the purest form of formula I can possibly give. She hated the taste of the latex rubber nipples so I bought some silicone ones and was successful.
When I consider the epidemic of autism in this country, I am dedicated to buying pure, organic baby products and avoiding using plastic products especially when heating in the microwave.

I had trouble getting my breastfed baby to take an Avent bottle (which my first took beautifully) so I called the lactation consultants at the hospital to ask their advice.  They suggested the Evenflo classic bottles which are like these except plastic with the clear nipple.  They worked great.  After swearing by Avent with my first, I never imagined the solution to feeding my second would be an "old-fashioned" type bottle.  It works though so I will stick with them

I would like to state that I take issue with the previous reviews, in that they claim this piece is flimsy. It is NOT at all flimsy, nor does it look cheap. In fact, my husband and I have the entire set (changing table and dresser), along with the Montery Crib.  When you receive the boxes, there is an instruction booklet that clearly states that the manufacturer, not the store, will handle all returns, exchanges, or shipping of missing parts. Well, we had a question regarging set-up of this product and thought there was a defect. We spoke with Storkcraft directly, and found thqat we were not following the assembly directions properly. Storkcraft was exremely helpful and pleasant, and promised us that we could return the item at any time to them DIRECTLY, and they would arrange for a prompt exchange.  This piece looks beautiful, and serves its purpose as a infant/child dresser. I am sure that you could spend $1,000 on a high-end piece, but if you are looking for something that is 1) AFFORDABLE, and 2) WELL-MADE, and 3) BEAUTIFUL, then Storkcraft is a good choice

I was given a Swaddle Me for my third child.  She has been my only child that slept through the night at five weeks.  My oldest did not sleep through the night until nine months and my second still does not.  I owe it all to the Swaddle Me. But at three months she outgrew the small size.  I thought she was old enough to go without swaddling, boy was I wrong.  It took me a month of sleepless nights to purchase the larger size.  I have had my large Swaddle Me for two weeks and have had two nights of trouble since then.  Thank you Swaddle Me for helping me keep my sanity

Since I also have a two year old, it has been so great to have this wrap.  I can go to the park with him and not have to leave the baby in a stoller and I can keep my hands free.  The best part is that my baby falls asleep in the wrap usually within five minutes.  If he is fussy and I don't really know why, it is so easy to put him in here and take the kids for a walk.  The only drawback is that it is a bit comebersome, so I wouldn't use it if I was only going to have it on for a few minutes.  This is such a great way to get the things done that you need to do while still staying close to your baby.  And the wide straps keep it from hurting my back at all

I like the fact that Kidsline offers extra crib sheets to go with the Zanzibar theme and am impressed with the quality of these sheets (I have two, one came with the bedding set and one was purchased off my baby registry) . They wash extremely well (still looks new), are soft and fit the mattress appropriately. However, I think $16.99 for a crib sheet is a bit pricey and have purchased other crib sheets that match the theme and are just as nice. (Amy coe, sage green at Target for $8.99 and koala baby sage green for $9.99 at BRU).  Since you need several crib sheets, I just don't feel the price is worth it for this one.

My daughter is breastfed, but we introduced a bottle around 3 weeks to ensure that she would take one (with pumped milk and/or formula).  We originally bought Avent bottles and had no problems until all of a sudden at 2-1/2 months she went bonkers!  Refused to drink from the bottle.  Granted we had be a bit lax on giving her bottles (not every day, but at least once per week).  I tried a Dr. Browns and it was the same problem.  And it didn't matter if it was breastmilk, forumula, warm, cold, room-temp, etc.  She just screamed!

during this time, she had been using a Platex ortho pacifier, but had begun using the soothie pacifer I got from the Hospital.  She didn't like the soothie pacifier at all to begin with...took several months for her to like it.  Anyway, I randomly had a freebie Soothie bottle from motherhood maternity in the drawer that I thought I might as well try.  she took it immediately!!

I have since bought several more in preparation for daycare, and she still takes them with no problems (she's 4 months now).  I have not had any problem with leaks, and in fact she stays much much cleaner with this bottle than she did with Avent.  

My only problem, is there is no disc to put underneath the nipple when transporting or mixing in the bottle.  However, the stage 1 nipples are pretty slow, so as long as its kept upright it does okay.  I have been using my old avent bottle with sealing discs as milk transport and pouring into the Soothie to feed.

My granddaughter was 6 weeks premature and at 4 lbs , she had no problem with the soothie bottle , the pacifer she loves , the bottles are easy to clean and love that the cap snaps on the bottom of the bottle while feeding , like the little cups to hold the powder formual .Haven't had a problem with the bottles leaking . Love the ones with the designs of Winnie-the-Pooh on them , wish they came in the 3 bottle set , also wish you could buy the little snack( formula ) containers seperately not just in the large sets .  Would recommend for any baby .

While these aren't waterPROOF, they provide enough additional protection to give you a little more confidence in going out of the house in underwear. So soft, and a little more absorbent than the Gerber ones. They aren't as trim a fit as some of the other brands, but my son really likes the roomy feel

This pail does not need special plastic bags--you can use leftover grocery bags, etc., which is a big advantage. I don't know why people buy those diaper pails that individually wraps every dirty diaper--a baby's poop does not smell bad!

This pillow is the best! After sleeping with it the first night, I new I couldn't be without it.  My husband bought it for me and I am so thankful.  I left it at my mother's house one night and I could not sleep, I keep waking up.  The night after getting it back I slept like a baby again.  If you are having trouble sleeping you have to buy this!  Its very soft, and you can take the cover off to wash it

I bought this same crib in May of 2005 from Buy Buy Baby and it came in six weeks pretty easy to assemble I did it while I was pregnant. It had no scartches or chips. I like it a lot and my daughter loves it. we havent converted it to a toddler bed or the full bed shes only 2. But its very roomy. It can get dented a little easily as when she banged a toy on it there were some dents but since its in white you dont notice it that much.
I really like it cuz the quality is superb and we're very very happy with. In fact we bought another one from amazon, for my son. My kids are 12 months apart so we needed another crib for him since now hes 1. He likes it a lot too. But even though company and everything is the same. the crib did come with some damaging to it, but it wasnt that bad, you dont really notice it, we got lucky i guess. But i do plan to just paint over the parts where the white paint has come off. The quality also seems different it doesnt seem as dense as the first one I bought. I dont know whether the manufacturing has changed or its quality issues. But overall its a nice crib I just wish it came in better condition and that it was the same wood feeling as the first one. But its definately worth the buy. AND it came with SUPER FAST SHIPPING with amazon. and the shipping was free too. But its well worth the buy!!!!!! My kids are happy and so im happy!!

I ordered this at Christmas with the free super saver shipping.  The crib arrived within a week.  Assembly was simple and the crib feels very sturdy and stable.  It's attractive, but my only complaints are 1)it did arrive with about five different chipped/gouged areas in the white paint (this was easily remedied by touching up with white paint) and 2) the bolts are exposed on the crib-it would have looked better if they had provided caps.  Overall, I'm very happy with the crib AND the price- can't wait to use it for my little girl who is due in May

This crib is beautiful and exactly what we were looking for. Our first shipment came in damaged but after a short phone call a second one was on it's way. Great customer service. The quality of the bed is outstanding. We purchased it for our first child but should also be able to use for the second when that time comes

My wife and I just finished putting this crib together.  It took a total of 25 minutes start to finish.  The instructions were extremely easy to follow.  We bought this exact crib in honey oak 18 months ago for baby number one and it has worked so well, we ordered the same crib in white for baby number two.  Our original crib is in the same great shape as when we first put it together.  The only adjustments we have done, where to lower the mattress support heights from higher to lower.  Even that process only took a matter of minutes.  I have read crib purchase reviews where the box arrived extremely beat up.  When ours arrived the outside of the box was a little rough, but the crib pieces inside are very well packed, padded, and wrapped and there was not a scratch on the white finish.  The super saver free shipping arrived at our door 6 days from date of purchase.  I have never wrote a review for an online purchase before, but we are so pleased with our two cribs that I wanted to pass on a very positive message to those who may be comtemplating buying this crib.  
P.S.  I'm a physician and this crib could not be any safer...no solid side walls or backing...just the well spaced rounded slates all the way around and no moving part

My 5 month old daughter always put her face into the bumpers on her crib so I stopped putting her in the crib because I was afraid of her sufficating and without the bumbers her hands and feet could still get in between the rails on the crib and because she moves aroung so much I was afraid of her hurting herself. So now I love puttingher in the crib because the bumpers are mesh and I don't have to worry. They were also real simple to put on because of the velcro and when you change the sheet on the crib its alot easier to get the matress back in because the bumper is so flat. Great product! I highly recommend it!!!!

AFTER READING ALL THE HORROR STORIES, WE WERE LEARY TO PURCHASE BUT DECIDED TO WELL IN ADVANCE OF OUR CHILD'S BIRTH.  WE RECIEVED THE ARMOIRE WITHIN 2 WEEKS OF PLACING THE ORDER. IT WAS EASY TO PUT TOGETHER (LESS THAN 1.5HRS). THERE WERE SOME SCREWS MISSING FOR THE DOORS, BUT I CALLED STORCRAFT THE NEXT DAY, AND WAS IMMEDIATELY PUT THROUGH WITH NO BUSY SIGNALS.  THEY SENT OUT THE SCREWS AND I HAD THEM WITHIN 10 WORKING DAYS (THEY COME FROM CANADA).  IT IS BEAUTIFUL WITH NOT ONE NICK OR DING IN IT. WE'D RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE AS PART OF THEIR CHILDS NURSERY.  FYI - IT WAS NOT CHEAPER AT WALMART ONCE TAX AND SHIPPING WERE INCLUDED

My son is going through potty traning and he hates those toilet covers, he just wont sit in them; so this product was our solution for him when we are out. It is small, but my son (20 months old) fits fine in it! The problem is I can't find the liners anywhere.

The crib just the way it comes is best.  A thicker mattress would be bad for 2 reasons.  Firm is best to avoid suffocation dangers.  Bumber pads are also recommended against by *all* modern advice sites and classes.  SIDS deaths appear to be related to suffocation, and this happens usually when the baby's mouth and nose are against padding.  Firm mattress (like this very thin one) are much safer.  The main thing is to always lay the infant on it's back to sleep, and not on it's belly.  Also, never use a bumber padding in *any* crib for any very young child.  Finally, there is also the issue of "outgassing" of any kind of waterproof plastic type matress covers and foam filling.   What you want, if you can't afford the very expensive natural options, is a *thin* mattress like this one, that won't have a lot of material to outgas, thus reducing the exposure of your baby to these common somewhat toxic VOCs.  Best is to buy this a few weeks (or longer) ahead of time, and then air out the mattress.  I'm even putting ours in the clothes dryer on low heat just past the switch off point, so that the drying heats it up a little and then clicks off the heat and continues exhausting air past it until the end of cycle.  This is my own idea of how to accelerate the outgassing, so that our new baby in January won't have much VOCs to breath.

We have 2 kids in a 2-bedroom apartment.  When our 2nd child was born, we put him in our bedroom.  There is not much space there, so this portable crib was a great find!  We use it as a permanent crib until our son outgrows it.   

Pros: saves space, folds, easy to move from room to room (on wheels), really easy to change the sheets (compared to regular crib with heavy matress).  It also has very neutral color and style, so it fits really well with other traditional furniture.

Cons: the baby will outgrow it in about 1 year, the matress is extremely thin (about 1 inch!).  We bought an extra matress (the normal thickness) for about $20.  To find it, do a search for "portable crib matress"

My wife and I like the portable crib quite a bit.  It is great to move from room to room and you can pull it up next to your bed similar to a co-sleeper.  The price is also not bad at all.  The only annoying thing is that the mattress pad that comes with it is so flimsy as to be practically unusable.  (We went to Baby Depot and bought a serviceable pad for about $20.)  Even after buying the extra mattress pad I still think the portable crib was a good buy and I do not regret our decision to buy the crib at all.  (I would buy the crib again if I had to start all over--our son sleeps quite well in it.

I bought this pump when I was going to a concert and knew I would need to pump while I was out to avoid discomfort and leakage.  This pump fit in my purse and was easy to use.  I just slipped out into the bathroom and pumped. It was silent and no one even knew

I researched many breast pumps on line before my daughter was born. After she was two weeks old, and my milk supply was established, I decided to purchase a pump. I had read many reviews about ISIS and was so skeptical...and I didn't want to pay $300 for an automatic one. I enjoy breastfeeding so much, however, I am not comfortable nursing in public not to mention pumping allows my husband to feed her too. After much thought, I decided to purchase the ISIS &amp;quot;back to work&amp;quot;. It came with the pump, bottles and the tote (which by the way is very discreet). I had no trouble assembling it at all. From the first time I used ISIS I've had great success. I am able to pump several ounces in 15 minutes, without any pain or discomfort as I control the suction. Our daughter does not have any problems switching from bottle to breast at all, nor have we ever experienced bottles/nipples leaking. I assemble the pump and the nipples/rings when they are just out of the sterilizer and are still wet. I love how easy this is to use and I don't have to find a place to plug it in at work. The only thing I've noticed is that the little gel packs don't stay cool enough for my liking so I went and purchased 2 little ice packs (.90 cents) and they work like a charm! I would recommend this to any Mom!

My Wife and I bought this item for the usual reasons.  We washed them and had no problems with fuzzballs or shredding.  They're just as soft and sturdy as they were before we washed them, if not a little softer.  For the record, we washed them on the cold cycle with other baby clothes.  They went through the drier for an hour at the lowest heat setting.  

Anyway, I'm just writing the review to offset the bad review.  There was nothing wrong with the pads that we received, and they do what they're supposed to do-- get between the warm baby and the cold changing table

I was surprised at what a good size this rug was.  It matches the bedding perfect.  The only negative thing I can say about it, is that it tends to scoot around a little bit when you walk on it.  I put it right in front of my son's crib and by the end of the day half of it seems to have scooted under the crib.  It could probably use some kind of gripping material underneath it to keep it in place

Product shipped quickly and was well packaged. Each loop or hole on the edge has an individual string that you have to tread. Would have been better if the strings were attached to the netting. Overall, the product works very well and gave us the protection for our child we were looking for. Our 22 month old tested it contiually by pushing hard and running into it and there were no problems

We just installed these this weekend on our upstairs banisters - they're great. They're strong enough to keep our 11-month-old baby from falling through -- we pushed and pulled on them after getting them all fastened. I still intend to watch him carefully when he's up there, but these will definitely protect him in an emergency. Just be sure to follow directions -- tie them tightly!! They're not that bad, looks-wise, either. I can still see my spindles through the netting so the "look" of the stairway is basically unchanged. Of course, looks are less important than safety! I think I'm going to get these for our outdoor deck, as well. I'd recommend them

My baby has used this since she was 4 months old It has a sturdy wide base..It has height adjusters...you can recline it..very secure safty belts but I do make sure my babies hands are nowhere near it when I buckle it thats the only thing I dislike about this highchair.  I dont find it hard to clean ..it comes with two trays and it has wheels and folds up definately worth the money especially now because it's on sale ..I paid full price :(

I love this car seat except for the fact that the one I have is defective.  The crotch snap does not work properly.  When I contacted Baby Trend, they advised that they do not exchange or repair their products free, even though mine was manufactured in October 2006 & I contacted them in December - less than a month after I bought it.

Otherwise, this is a wonderful seat.  I love the triangular handle.  I use it with the Snap & Go and have no trouble at all transferring her.  If she falls asleep in it, it is easy to take her wherever I want without disturbing her.  She seems very comfortable in it as well.  She was born November 12, 2006.

The hood is such that it can block out the sun, no matter from which direction it is shining.  And you can still see her face - if you are tall enough.

The product is great - if yours if fully functioning.  I'm anxious for her to grow to 20 pounds so I can buy another seat.  As it is, I try not to take her in the car any more than I have to because of the defective lock since I can't spring for another seat now.  I will never buy another Baby Trend for that reason

This is our first and only child seat and has worked quite well for us. We do need to put in a specialized cushon for our baby's head. There have been recent articles warning against letting your baby sleep in a child seat and sine babies' head muscles aren't very strong, the support is a good addition.  I find the triangle grip excellent but even with a small baby in the seat, you will not want to cary this very far at all.  My wife in fact had a back injury carying our son in this seat and that was just from the car to our house !  Some day, these seats may come with some other innovation making them more ergonomic for parents.  I don't know that it would have been different in another seat, but be warned, these things are not meant to actually carry a child by hand and women have weakened muscles after giving birth. It's a terrible combination.  Carying the baby in this seat should be a task for husbands for several months as I found out too late.

Back to the seat, it works quite well in the car and with the baby trend snap-n-go. We use the snap-n-go quite often and it prevents you from repeatedly removing your child from the seat and snapping him back in (which can be trying for you and your kid).

I was disappointed the unit had no SPF rating for the sun shade. That feature may not have made it to child seats but sun protection is extremely important for babies and it wouldn't be difficult to use a protective fabric.  I called Baby Trend and they had no idea if and how well the shade actually blocked harmful UV rays.  Other seats may not have this feature either but we will look closely for it in the future after being sternly warned by the child safety class at the hospital.  Babies have super sensitive skin and it's important to avoid any direct sunlight if possible. I know it sounds extreme and alarmist but it also should be very easy to do and is recommended by the American Adadamy of Pediatrics ([...]). For now, you would need an additional cover on top of the included cover.

Pros: Consumer report top pick, not as expensive as some

Cons: No SPF rating or sun UV protection listed for sun shade. Heavy and non ergonimic to cary by hand (not a complaint specific to this particular seat, they probably all are)

We bought this crib online & couldn't be more pleased.  The shipping was great - a few minor nicks but nothing overly noticeable.  The directions aren't bad - but they could be a lot better/clearer.  We also bought the matching change table & it looks great in the baby's room. Net, great value for a great product!

We loved this product and our little girl loved it even more!  We used it from the time she was 4 months to almost 10 months.  We have a nice wide doorway that we were able to put the jumper in.  We never had any problems with fingers getting pinched or heads getting bumped.  We believe her coordination is better because she used this so often.  At just 14 months, she could jump with both feet off the ground.  It is a quality product at a reasonable price.  Would highly recommend

This is my third child and third infant car seat.  This was the most expensive, but worth the money.  The padding keeps the baby's head from that scary 90 degree flop; the shoulder straps have padding which prevents the red marks the others left on my kids; the straps don't get twisted and it's much easier to get in and out of the car.  It's the same weight as the others (which is to say rather heavy and awkward to carry).  The only thing I don't like is it does not fit on shopping carts.  Worth the money

I received this set at a baby shower back in 2005.  It has held up really well.  My only advice: with a retail price of $232.00 and even an Amazon price of $152, it's still too steep.  I never had the quilt in the crib because it is dangerous to do so with a baby - and he was constantly napping, so I hardly ever "made" the bed.  Next time around, I'm going to find a pattern I like and just buy all of the decorative things associated with it, then buy an inexpensive and plain bumper and sheet. The room itself is what you and everyone else sees.  The bedding is almost impossible to see, unless you're hovering over the crib.  

I do especially love the lamp, switchplate, mobile and 5-pc wall hanging from this collection.  You could buy all the accessories to truly create a safari room for less than the cost of the bedding alone.

I ordered the 6 piece crib set plus other Zanzibar items to go with it and was really pleased at the quality & softness of the fabrics. It's beautiful and looks very nice and cozy.
I have a bigger crib that later turns into a twin bed, so what I did to make the quilt bigger was to use the fitted sheet to make an addition. I also used the dust ruffle to make the bumper bigger and some pillows which look great in the sofa I have in the room.

This is a great walker. The tray has plenty of activities to keep the little one busy and the music steering wheel and button lights can easily be removed to make the tray even bigger. My grandson just loves the walker and I do too because it gives him the freedom to move from place to place safely. Amazon sells model #14570, so don't worry, the walker is sturdy with locking wheels for when you prefer him to stay stationary. Also, a plus is that it converts into a walk behind walker which assists the child learning to walk

I am a first time expectant mother and like most excited moms-to-be, I read pretty much all of the reviews on every item I need to register for or buy for baby. However, the helpful hint I have to give comes from my other half who already has a son and has used a wipe warmer. He said the wipe warmers that heat from the bottom up (heat ALL of the wipes) are a waste of money because by the time you get to the bottom wipes....they are dried out from being continuously reheated. They basically lose their moisture which defeats the purpose of a wipe in the first place and you end up throwing a bunch of them out without the benefit of using them first. We opted to go with this one because it seems to be smaller (more convenient for travel which we will do a fair amount of) and it heats just the first few wipes which is usually all you need for a diaper change. Some mothers would say this is not really a necessary thing to have (after all, babies lived through diaper use just fine before these things were invented), but because our baby will be born during the winter, I thought this would have more use for us. I gave this product four stars because we haven't tried it yet....but just wanted to pass that helpful hint along to other mothers who are interested in practicality and saving money and hopefully not losing quality in the process

The first night we had our daughter home, she would wake up about every 45 minutes. My wife and I were pulling shifts to take care of her. Finally, at 6am, my wife says, "Hey, lets try the secure sleeper that we bought". We haven't removed it from her bassinet since. The product does as it says and we swear by it. She is only 2 1/2 weeks old now and sleeps about 5-6 hrs a night. The velcro "rolls" can adjust to the babies size. The previous statement about baby falling off may be because the baby is too large. Given the size of the secure sleeper, it's not hard to believe that it will not last once the baby is larger than the sleeper. Overall, a great product!

Despite some negative reviews I got this seat because I have an 8 mth and 2.5 yr old and my husband is deployed so bathtime can be very challenging. I also have a textured bathtub bottom so I knew a bathring would not work. 

Well this seat is fantastic - my baby loves to sit in it and tries to grab all of the bath toys so he can chew on them. Also, whenever I get the baby in the toddler wants to jump in too which is so much easier then conjoling an ornery 2 yr old into the tub. Since using the bath seat my infant hasn't scraped his legs on it once like some other reviewers mentioned so not sure what that is about. And although he has tried to climb out a couple of times he is usually content to sit there. Of course even with this seat you can't let such little ones bathe unsupervised anyways so it is fine when he tries to get out - I just put him back and he is happy. Even when I don't bath the two together I put the little one in here - just makes it so much easier then trying to hold him steady (he is such a wiggler - trying to crawl/stand immediately)and having my hands free to scrub him. To clean his bottom I just pull him out clean him and then stick him back in - no problem. To clean the seat I've followed the advice of other posts and again no problem.

I actually came back here to buy one for my sister but I see that it isn't available right now -boo - I'll have to find it elsewhere. 

Highly recommend

There are a few things that I liked about my simple round about better.  Such as, the latch system is more difficult in the Decathalon.  Overall though, very impressive car seat safety system.  The fabric for the cover is wonderful and plush and stylish.  I always feel safe when my little ones are in a Britax.  Well worth what may seem like an exorbitant amount of money.  You cannot put a price on the safety of your child

The first time I used this shopping cart cover my daughter fell asleep (need I say anymore)? It fits nearly every shopping cart, it's easy to fold and unfold, and it gives me the peace of mind knowing that all of those shopping cart germs aren't coming home with us! Well worth the extra peace of mind it gives me

I highly recommend this item.  As soon as your little one can sit up on his own, this is a MUST HAVE for all moms.  It fits all shopping carts (except COSTCO, but including TARGET) as well as those icky high chairs available at restaurants.  It keeps baby (and Mommy's hands) from touching the cart handle and prevents the kiddo from wedging his legs in the wrong hole in the cart.  A MUST HAVE! This is the gift I give at baby showers.  I've had for over a year and it has survived many a washing with a touch of bleach.  Still looks good

I love this blanket so much let me count the ways...(1) certified organic (so hard to find), (2) large enough for a good, tight swaddle (for a good night sleep), (3) darling drawing showing how to swaddle baby sewn to blanket (even my husband can now swaddle like a nurse), (4) soft, soft, and softer with every wash! I just love this blanket and I feel so good wrapping my little bundle in the ULTIMATE - and I know he loves it too

My husband and I received this changing table, along with the 4-drawer chest and the Monterey crib, as a gift from our parents. We were skeptical, because we wanted a nursery that was affordable, yet not too flimsy.  We were pleasantly surprised once the pieces were put together. The pieces coordinate beautifully with the nursery, and will take our soon-to-be-born infant into childhood. And the nicest part is that you don't have to spend thousands of dollars to have a nice nursery. My friends and family are constantly complimenting us on how great the pieces look and how sturdy they are. * The only reason I rated this 4-stars instead of 5 was because two of the drawers rubbed together slightly once assembled. It was very easily fixed by adjusting the drawer tracks, took 5 minutes. BOTTOM LINE: If you are looking for a beautiful, quality nursery that is affordable, this is a great choice

We were just at the baby store to choose carseats and the Britax Marathon carseat on display had a Gogo Babyz Travelmate attached to it.  It was so easy to maneuver that my 7 year old daughter wheeled her 20 pound baby sister around the aisle for fun. Two large, solid, screw-in knobs attach the Travelmate to a backplate that secures the seat.  The whole combination looks very sturdy and relatively easy to use.  We bought both the Marathon and Travelmate. We were looking for a better alternative to the Sit 'n Stroll.  This may be it.  I cannot compare the two options as I have never tried the Sit 'n Stroll, only read the so-so reviews.

This pump works great for occasional use and after 5 months, I still have not encountered any problems with the suction that some reviewers have mentioned.  (The instruction book explains how to clean the motor in the event of suction loss, so hopefully that problem is avoidable.)  However, beware that the motor is very loud -- I definitely wouldn't recommend taking this one to work or anywhere else that you would need to be discreet.  (When I use it, I sit in the bathroom with the fan on so that my family doesn't have to hear it!)  I also recommend buying the micro-steam bags by Medela so you can just throw the parts in the microwave and clean them right away each time you use them

I decided to by this pump instead of the single because it saves time to do both sides at once. This pump works very well and I quickly get the milk I need. I like that there are different levels of suction to fit my comfort. I gave it four stars because it is a little difficult to change speeds and adjust with both hands being occupied. Sometimes one side looses suction and while I am trying to fix it the other side looses suction because I had to remove my hand from holding it in place

I purchased the Medela Double Select Pump in anticipation for the arrival of my second child per the recommendation of a relative who had great success with this model (we both had a terrible time with manual pumps in the past).  I am extremely pleased with this pump.  I can easily fill two bottles within a few minutes and have never had any trouble with the suction, motor, malfunctioning equipment, etc.  It is extremely easy to put together and take apart, as well as easy to clean.  You will have to buy a pack of Medela bottles before the first use as they are not included.  And yes, the motor is a little noisy, but not unbearably so.  It has neither disrupted my children's sleep, for example, nor become irritating for me.  It is also versatile enough to pump on both sides simultaneously or just on one side.  Additionally, the Medela company has a very solid reputation and I understand that their customer service is very good when it comes to problems with their products.  I think that this pump is a wise choice for part-time use (not more than once or twice a day, at that).  I've had much success and I think that most of you will too

I breast fed my son for a year in 2003 with the Medela pump back then.  I trusted Medela to pick up this one for my daughter this year.  I pump once a day, so they get used, but not abused.  The model has changed some, I think it is more powerful this time.  The thing I don't like, but certainly can live with, is the motor not being attached to the breast shield.  My chest is rather large, so putting the bottles in the unit and holding the unit to my chest with one hand is not an option.  I have to hold each shield upto my chest and the motor sits in my lap.  I can't control the speed or turn the unit on/off because I don't have a free hand.  I leave the speed where I need it before and take the bottle off while it's still on and put it in the bottle holder while I turn the unit off.  I still very much like this product as it gets the job done

I borrowed this pump from a Mom who just used it the 8 weeks she was out of work.  I used it FREQUENTLY (at least twice daily) for the 5 months I pumped at work.  It always worked wonderfully.  I never had trouble with let-down or supply.  Sometimes I filled both 8 oz. bottles in a 15-minute session!  Unless you have problems with breastfeeding or milk supply, I can't imagine this pump not working great.  I didn't have any problems with it the whole time I used it

We took this stroller to use for our 13 month old at Disney World & it was great!!  It held the bags we needed in the park and was very easy to get on and off busses / monorail / etc.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  It was great to have it in the airport too.  The only problem we had was that the cupholder was broken off by the airline when it was gate checked, but we can get a replacement.

We bought this stroller to take on vacation and it proved to be easy to check at the gate of the airline, was lightweight, and continues to be a functional, comfortable stroller for our son.  The one feature that I expected to be different was how far the stroller reclined...it only slightly reclines so is not useful for a little one who needs to lay down further to nap while on the go.  I was happy with the amount of storage, but at times wished to have a storage compartment under the seat for my bag.  All in all, we are very happy with this purchase!

We were concerned about using a regular crib bumper for our tall toddler, but we needed something to keep his pacifiers in his crib at night.  This crib bumper does the job.  When he stands on it, it collapses, so it's no help boosting him over the side.

My one gripe (which I'm not sure there's a way around) is that there's a gap between the front crib corners and the bumper that attaches to the front rail (the one that slides up and down).  Because our little one is older, we put stuffed animals in the corners, but I'm not sure how comfortable I'd be using the bumper with an infant who might get her legs or arms caught

I love this bumper. It isn't thick like the padded bumpers and fits the crib nicely, without bunching. And the price is much more reasonable than the $$ bumpers that go with bedding sets. Mostly I can feel secure that my little one is safe even if he rolls up to the edge of the railings. I know his arms and legs won't get tangled in the railings, but he also can breathe. Great product. It is cute too and looks very nice on a white crib.

My daughter (2 1/2 yrs old) likes this cot, a lot.
I bought it for her so that she could nap on it while my M-I-L is over watching her since she has a hard time with stairs and lifting toddler into high crib.  

She sleeps on it for about 1 1/2 - 2 hours in the afternoon, which is about 1 hour shorter than if she were to nap in her crib inside her (darkened) room.  

It suits this purpose well and I intend on taking it on overnight weekend trips so we don't have to haul her port-a-crib.  

The only disadvantage is that she can get out of it, of course, but... it's a cot! 

She began daycare recently and sleeps on their cots for the same amount of time, so I figured I'd buy it for my M-I-L at home.  It does the trick and my baby thinks it's special.  I tell her that it's only for when Grandma S is over (b/c she wanted to start sleeping/napping in it all the time).  

Naturally, I'd prefer she take a longer nap, so I told her it's for special days only, when Grandma S is here.  So now she uses it to "tuck in" her bunny-bear stuffed animal before she goes to her room at night.  

I love it, and it seems comfortable, very portable and handy.  I would recommend it.  

The only reason I'm not rating it 5 stars is that I have yet to use it on a weekend trip, but I wanted to review it now, in case you were wondering whether or not to get it.  I think it's very much worth it, but everyone's different.  It's relatively small and inexpensive so if your child hates it they may like it for their stuffed animal friends.

Also, it is very sturdy & supportive and opens and collapses with no trouble at all.

Hope that helps

I purchased this for my 17 month old son who normally sleeps in a crib. I was told that the daycare that he would be entering uses cots. So in figuring this would also be good for travel, I bought it. My son loves it! The whole thing is like a mesh beach chair. I put it together in about 8 seconds. The removable fitted sheet that comes with it -is soft. The entire thing is easy to wipe clean. It looks comfy. It says it is good for kids up to 75lbs. and 52 inches. (Good to know) My favorite feature is how tiny it folds up - pretty light compared to other cots. Not nearly as bulky, too! Nice royal Blue colors

My son was 20 lbs at 6 mos., so we had to stop using front carriers :(  I bought the Combi as well as this one and this one is much more user friendly (SO easy to get on and off by yourself) and much more comfortable. I've read reviewers saying it's uncomfortable...well if you have a big baby...it's just going to be uncomfortable! They're heavy! But this is the best one & it's nice to give your arms a break! The neck strap is well padded and easy to switch from one side to the other (for relief) w/o taking the baby out. It's compact enough to keep with you. And if you're baby just needs to be close to you or held sometimes...it's a MUST HAVE! We took a trip last week and it was PRICELESS! One tip: read the instruction manual and you will enjoy this product a ton more

For all the reviews that have written that this product has been recalled, that is incorrect. It was the original Hip Hammock and all those that were in the stores were removed from the shelves. So unless you have an older model that was bought before 2/2005, you should have nothing to worry about. This product is great when your baby outgrowns the front carriers like the Baby Bjorn. I have had no problems with it and it is easier than using a sling with older babies.

I bought this item based on safety and comfort reviews from consumer reports and I'd have to say the reviews I read about on the Titan were dead on.  My 7 month old is very long for his age and he loves the freedom this seat provides as opposed to the cramped car seat we were using.  I also like the fact that as he grows into a toddler and is able to sit forward I can still use this seat - I wish I had bought this seat from the get go

Out of all the department stores here, I got a recommendation to choose the titan over the triumph, for the easness. It got noted as lighter and easier to deal with. I secound the so far so good comment earlier.. Its comfortable than most seats I have shopped for besides the #1 Britax that I have yet to experience:)

I LOVE these cups and better yet so does my baby!  They are easy for her to hold and the soft tip makes it easy for her to drink.  She has no idea that it's not a bottle.  It has made the transition away from the bottle so much easier.  Thank you

My son is now 2 and has been a bottle baby. We have atleast 10 different cups and he has always refused them and screamed for his bottle. 
 Lastnight we bought this terrific cup and he has not asked for the bottle yet! I will now be putting the bottles away for good this time! I will be ordering a few more so we always have one on hand.  
 They are pricey, but if I wouldn't have bought all the other cups, I'd have had plenty of money saved just by buying these in the first place!

I was a diehard graco fan.  When my daughter was born 2002 the Graco Snugride was the top rated infant seat (I put a lot of stock into what consumer reports has to say).  The infant seat was great and we got it as part of the travel system.  I loved both the stroller and seat, and was very sad when she outgrew the seat around 1 years old.  I tried an Eddie Bauer convertible seat next and it was horrible, the straps always twisted and my daughter's head always fell forward onto her chest when she fell asleep.  I quickly changed the Graco Comfortsport (the one with the overhead drop down bar) and she loved it.  It had more padding, her head rested on the side of the carseat instead of her chest and the straps never twisted.  It was easy to get in and out and not too heavy to lug around in airports.  When she outgrew that seat I decided to make the switch to Britax.  Although the Roundabout was rate #1 on CR I went with the Marathon because the only thing CR didn't like about it was the infant latch (which I wouldn't need as my child was 3yrs old) and it had a higher weight limit than the Roundabout.  I own a Honda Accord 4 door and my husband drives a 4 door Toyota Echo (tiny).  The seat fits perfectly well in both vehicles in the forward facing position.  The Toyota has latch and the Honda doesn't but in both cars it doesn't move.  Partly due to the fact that my husband is excellent at installing and partly due to the car seats weight.  It is quite heavy, and it can be a pain to haul around airports.  My husband usually just loosens the straps and wears it like a backpack through the airport.  My daughter loves it, (we have a girly print, not the granite) it has plenty of room for her, she never is uncomfortable sleeping in it (her head doesn't sit on her chest either), and though she's a very bright 4 year old she's never been able to get out of the seat.  I love the fact that she can be in it until she's 65lbs with the five point restraint and the straps never twist.  Britax also does thoughtful things like adding velcro on the sides of the seat to hold the straps in place when you're putting your child in and having a padded area under the clip so your child isn't burned by the hot plastic in the summer (or freezing in the winter).  I plan on staying with Britax from here on out

I got four of these sleepsacks, two fleece and two cotton.  I found the fleece sleepsacks do get bitty after a couple of washes, but it didn't effect the product.  They are wonderful.  If you are buying for a newborn, get the 6-12 month size, since it'll last a bit longer. I ended up giving away the 0-6 month size, when my baby was only 3 months old, as it was getting a bit small.

my baby is now 5 months old, and we've been using the Halo sleep sac since she started moving around more.  I was always worried with the regular blanket because more than a few times she would wake up crying because she had kicked her regular blanket onto her face!  Now, I never worry that she will soffocate or that she will be cold in the middle of the night.  This product really gives me peace of mind and I'll be sure to give this to any new parent friends

This product works well with my Dr Brown's bottles.  There are holes in it that make it easy to stand up the inner parts of the bottles.  Much better looking than a lot of bottle drying racks.  I use a Sassy rubber bristled bottle brush so that it won't scratch the bottles, though.  The Sassy color totally coordinates perfectly

This is a wonderful stroller.  I'm so glad I took a chance and ordered it, sight unseen.

I ordered the red version, which is much snazzier in person than on the Amazon picture.

It is fairly lightweight - much lighter than our Graco model, but heavier than those cheap little umbrella strollers, nice and sturdy.  But it folds up in an umbrella fashion, so it won't take up too much room in your trunk and could be carried, if necessary.

It comes with neat things like a rain cover, sun shade, and cold weather boot.  The rain and shade covers are neatly contained in an attachable pouch and the boot fits easily in the stroller's basket.

The canopy has a window, provides lots of shade, and is even partially removable to let the breeze run through on a balmy day.  Coolest of all, it has a built in mesh pouch that doesn't take up any room but still manages to hold everything I need: sunscreen, hand sanitizer, wallet, keys, cell phone, and sunglasses.  It's stretchy mesh, so if you don't have anything it just lies flat against the hood.  But it does have a plastic lining, so it's waterproof!  Also, it zips, so your things can't fall out and aren't accessible to your two year old, either.

The basket is large enough for a medium sized diaper bag, although a small bag would fit best, especially if you want to keep the boot in there.

The best part is that everything is snazzy.  Everything looks nice, the materials feel great, and it's well designed.  The parts that should be removable/washable are.

It's a snap to put together (took just a couple of minutes) and everything locks into place in a smart way.  It's very easy to fold and unfold.  Also, it reclines beautifully and easily, including into a totally upright position.  I became frustrated that my Graco model's most upright position was still too reclined for our one year old.    

The place where your child's legs hang down is neat.  It is adjustable, so it could stick straight out, hang down, or even flip up for a very little one (maybe to use with the boot?)...  Your kid won't get a weird stroller mark on the underside of their little knees.

It has the newer style which I notice most new strollers seem to have where you only have to clip two things in to buckle a baby in.  My Graco model (purchased last year) is such a complicated mess.  You attach two things together on one side, two things together on the other side, then connect each side into the center.  Arg!  My son almost always fussed by the time I'd finished.  Also, he was always sitting on one of the straps, which easily became twisted.  My husband STILL has not figured out how to do this quickly.  :)  So this is a big improvement.

It's also comfy!  I can't vouch for that myself, of course.  But my son settles down into it and looks perfectly comfortable.  With the Graco model, he ended up with his legs flung over one side of the tray and if he wasn't tightly belted in he slouched down a lot.

A few minor imperfections about the Zooper Twist.  

The cupholder is a mesh bag attached to the handle.  It works well for a standard water bottle or something, but one of those giant mall-sized beverages might not be so great.  You can easily remedy this by investing in a good quality cup attachment, if that is important to you.

This stroller is great for me - I'm 5'5.  It would be nice if the stroller handles were adjustable.

This isn't a jogging stroller.  It does offer a nice feature where you can lock the front two wheels so they do not swivel, which makes going over rough surfaces safer and easier to manage.

This isn't the kind of stroller that is going to hold everything but the kitchen sink, if you are looking for that kind of stroller.  There isn't a cup and snack tray for your child.  No clock.

This is just the greatest stroller and I'm so glad to dump our awful Graco stroller.  Hated. that. thing.  This is snazzy, well designed, handy, lightweight, convenient, and offers everything we need

If anyone asked me what baby product I would have to have it would be this product!  I love it and it is very comfortable to use.  One negative thing though is that the suction cups do not work very well, so don't let your child use it because they could slip.  I would purchase it again and would give it as a gift

Very convenient carseat, can be placed in the combi double stroller, which is the only side by side stroller that I have seen that you can attach an infant seat into. (and I've searched a lot) The carseat is comprable to the Peg Perego Primo Viaggo (whichI also have) but you can;t connect that one into the Aria twin, the peg perego side by side.
 The seat itself is lightweight and easy to manage, and VERY soft with the foam insert. It's easy to get into the car with or without the base. Only complaint would be that the straps could be a little longer because you can't have both a baby bunting bag and the foam insert otherwise the straps aren't long enough to comfortably get the baby in and out.  
Also, our daughter was extremely colicky from 5 weeks to 12 weeks and would only sleep in this carseat, so it must be pretty comfortable

I have just got this bed set 5 days ago and love it! It could be used for a girl or boy. I have looked around for bedding for a portable crib and could not find anything I liked and they seemed high in price, well then I found this one and it's fits perfect on a portable crib. And it's alot cuter than the picture! I really do like it. The only thing is I wish it had a dust ruffel :

We have tried 3-4 different gates at the top of our stairway over the past 3 years with our 2 young children (now 4 yrs and a 10 month old).  This is a GREAT option for a gate.  Ours is solidly installed, it clicks shut automatically with an audible click (so after my 4 year old goes through, I don't have to worry about him leaving it open - it closes by itself AND I can hear the "click" that tells me it closed), and you don't have to drill holes in your woodwork/staircase to install this.

It is much easier to open, just as sturdy as the drill-in gates, and looks nicer than all of the other gates we tried.  We love it for our house

Our son has an especially strong startle reflex, and has to be swaddled to sleep, at all.  At 2.5 weeks, he startled being able to get out of any swaddle we did, no matter how expertly done, no matter what blanket we used.  So, at 1 hour of sleep, he'd start crying and we'd have to go in and start all over.  We searched online for actual "Swaddling" blankets and based on reviews, chose this one.  WHAT AN UTTER MIRACLE. We are in such debt to the dad who created this!  Our son is now 12 weeks old, and we use this for each nap and for nighttime sleep.  He was sleeping 6-7 hour stretches at 5 weeks, and slept 11 hours at 8 weeks.  We would never have this success without this blanket.  We've periodically tried to get him to sleep without it, but his reflex is STILL so strong that he needs it.  It took a little "getting used to" the method to get him wrapped up, but in no time we both were experts.  And the price on Amazon, with free shipping, is way better than what we paid directly through AMB.  I wholeheartedly reccommend this to all parents, especially new parents.

My son has colic and this blanket is a lifesaver! When I wrap him in it, he falls asleep and stays asleep for long periods of time. He can easily break out of the Swaddle Me, but not the Miracle Blanket. I am going ot buy this product for all of my pregnant friends!!

When we got our changing table from a friend who no longer needed it... They gave us the Diaper Depot as well. I love how it puts everything at an arms reach without clutting the changing table. It has lasted two kids before the one it's on now, so a total of three babies. I guess like anything if it's taken care of properly it won't break

Love it, and it is a must in our babies room, but the only drawback is that our wipe warmer (Lion Heart 2004 model) does not fit correctly. To fix this we just taped down the wipe warmer. I love that everything you need can be placed in the diaper depot and so easy to grab one handed of course. 

Note:
We do not use the bottom basket under the wipe warmer as a diaper storage but instead as a cloth towel holder and it works great, especially if you have a boy and need alittle protection and/or clean up from showers! Also our diaper stacker holds more and adds decor to the nursery's them

I purchased this stool with the matching seat cover for my daughter for potty training.  I like that the top has a non-slip cover on it to keep my daughter from slipping when getting up on the toilet.  She really likes that she has her own special stool for going potty, it has helped in encouraging her to start potty training

I have this seat for my 4 month old and I love it... Yes it is larger than your average infant car seat but I have no problems getting it in and out of my car which is a Toyota Avalon not the smallest car on the market but certainly not the biggest... With my daughter who is 5 when she moved to the convertible car seat the biggest downfall was having to wake her up to get out of the car... Graco has made it so that I no longer have to do this. My son is nearly 20lbs already and had I been using your average infant seat I would have to buy him a new one already... Bravo to Graco for making a seat with extra weight/height limits... Another perk is it has the canopy so the sun isn't in his eyes which I also wouldn't get if he were in a convertible car seat.

My one and only complaint is that the fabric isn't breathable so my son sweats a lot in this seat but I just put a receiving blanket between him and the seat and he is fine... This in itself isn't enough to make me trade this seat for another

My 6 month old daughter just transitioned from her infant seat carrier to the Britax Boulevard and is loving it.  She looks comfortable in it, and I really appreciate the side impact support in case of an accident.  I can really see her growing into it as well.  It is a little large for our Camry but there is still enough room for one other person (instead of 2) in the backseat

I got this car seat for my 10 month old daughter. I was concerned that it would be too large for my car (I have a Honda Civic), but it fit just fine. Rear-facing you would need to put in the center of the back seat, so if you have 2 kids, you would have to put the seats up further, but if you are short, that will likely not be an issue. I had it installed at the fire station and it fit in perfectly -- he installed it in minutes and did NOT need any foam pieces to make it fit properly! It was a perfect fit on its own.

Pros: 
1. it is the best car seat you can get!
2. has side impact protection -- also makes a good headrest when baby falls asleep
3. the adjust knob for the harness is awesome to adjust especially over large coats
4. the seat is very well cushioned, soft fabric
5. fits fine a small car even rear facing (I have a Civic)
6. it's heavy so its not going anywhere!
7. works for up to 65 pounds, so we will get a lot of use out of the seat
8. she loves it!

Cons:
1. it is large/heavy (though it is staying in my car so heavy is not a problem)
2. the strap to tighted the harness is a little tough to pull tight on a smaller child, but you need to pull straight out and not up
3. it is expensive

I highly recommend this seat (we have the Onyx fabric). It is large, heavy and expensive, but it is the best!! I had buyer's remorse for a few minutes, but I figured it is the best seat on the market right now and $300 is a small price to pay for protecting my daughter. I did a lot of research before buying and felt confident in my decision and in the seat! Very pleased with this seat! Also, please make sure you get your seat installed by a certified technician (Check with your local Children's Hospital). Improperly installed car seats and improper use of car seats is the leading cause of death among children and infants. Something very easy to prevent

Our 8-month-old daughter outgrew her infant carrier, and we needed a "big girl" car seat immediately.  I knew that we were going to purchase a car seat made by Britax because they are always consistently highly rated in crash tests and by other safety measures.  After reading reviews and checking out the Roundabout, Marathon and Boulevard seats in the store, we decided on the Boulevard.  I love the added protection the side-impact wings provide.  True, it is just about the most expensive car seat out there, but I believe it is well worth the price.

The only drawback was that I found none of the fabric options particuarly appealing.  I finally settled on Brownstone because I believe it to be the least dreadful of them all.  I was surprised to find that it is not as bad as I had imagined.  It is extremely soft (almost has a chenille-like feel) and does not get too hot (even in direct sunlight).  There is also the option of ordering different covers, if I tire of this one.

This car seat is pretty big, but it fits just fine in our Honda Accord (in the  middle of the back seat), and two normal-size people can easily fit on either side.  It was very easy to install using the LATCH system.  I have not had any problems or complaints.

My daughter seems very comfortable in her new car seat, and I feel safe with her in it

I bought this portable tent for my Graco Pack N Play because my toddler can climb out of it and I wanted him to be safe. We use this when visiting friends and relatives and it provides me with 100% peace of mind knowing that he won't be able to escape and injure himself. It is easy to attach to the portable crib and holds very securely. My only negative comment is that it's a little difficult to put together- I usually keep it assembled and throw it in my trunk to save time and my sanity.

I have a climber!  She could climb out of her crib at age 13 months.  She was way too young for a bed.  We also have the crib tent II and both items have allowed us to feel our now 22 month old daughter is safely in her crib at night--not roaming her room or house while we sleep.  It was either these products or emptying all the furniture out of her room, putting a mattress on the floor, and putting a lock on her door at night to keep her safe.  Life saver

AFTER 2 NIGHTS OF NO SLEEP BECAUSE OUR 18 MONTHS OLD SON FIGURED OUT HOW TO FLIP HIMSELF OUT OF THE PACK N PLAY (WITH JUST SHEER UPPER BODY STRENGTH!)I WAS SO RELIEVED TO FIND THIS CRIB TENT AND IT WAS A PAIN TO PUT TOGETHER (IT TOOK ABOUT 20 MINUTES) BUT WELL WORTH IT BECAUSE IT WORKS...HE HAS STAYED IN THE PACK N PLAY AND DIDN'T SEEM TO CARE AT ALL THAT HE WAS "TRAPPED", I THINK KIDS DO LIKE THE PLAYFULNESS OF A TENT. MY 4 YEAR OLD WAS JEALOUS! THERE ARE A FEW DOWNSIDES...ITS A PAIN TO SET UP AND BREAK DOWN AND IF YOUR USING THE PACK N PLAY FOR OVER NIGHTS AND TRAVEL IT ISN'T AS PORTABLE AS COULD BE...AND I HAVE AN OLDER PACK N PLAY, ITS FROM '02 WHEN WE HAD OUR FIRST BABY SO THE ENDS ARE HIGHER THAN THE SIDES SO THE CLIPS HAVE NO WHERE TO CLIP ONTO BUT IT HASN'T MATTERED. THE SIDE CLIPS HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TO KEEP OUR STRONG TODDLER IN PLACE. OVERALL THE PRODUCT IS EXPENSIVE AND A PAIN TO SET UP BUT PRICELESS BECAUSE IT LETS THE WHOLE FAMILY SLEEP SOUNDLY AND SAFELY!

I am surprised to read that people don't like this mirror. We have had it since our son was 1 mon. and we still use it at 7 mon. We have a Trailblazer and it installed easily and we can see him great even over his Britax Marathon carseat. It has been great for road trips (our son was entertained even on a 9-hour trip) and has been a blessing for short trips to the store. We don't always use the music/lights but the mirror is always handy. We have never had trouble with it being too soft. I have given this as shower gifts and my friends have been pleased as well. Def. recommended.

A great success. I love all Kiddapotamus products, that I bought so far because they are well-done, thoughtful and win awards all the time - but best of all, they are really very handy.

We went to a restaurant and for the first time we could put our sons food right on the placemat on the table so that he could feed himself. Without that mat, we had to hold onto the food or but a napkin underneath - so one of us was always busy with our son instead of enjoying a dinner out. The placemat comes with a scoop that holds most of the food that our son will drop from his mat and the floor was still clean after we left. Best of all with this mat we can provide a germfree space for him to sit, eat and play - on our table. He was really happy about it.

After our visit we rolled this wonderful placemat together and put it in my handbag.

I was really satisfied

I bought this w/ the hippo travel high chair.  It worked great and kept things cleaner.  Unfortunately it was in the case w/ the chair when it was stolen out of our truck.

I have used both this product and the disposable kind that have stickers to keep them on the table, and I like both for different reasons.  The disposable ones are sort of expensive, but very portable when I am flying and visiting relatives.  The Hippo one is great to grab and go around town, when I am not concerned about the weight of my diaper bag.  I have had waiters thank me at many restaurants!  Just fold the mess right up and clean at home!  My son is way too young to have a plate and not toss it, and I don't want him eating off of a table that is probably full of nasty germs.  This hippo is really durable too, I have used this same mat for over 3 years, (I first got it for my daughter) and it still looks great

I got this product b/c when we first put our daughter in the highchair when we went out to eat she immediately wanted to touch the table.  I was fine with it until I wiped the table off and was disgusted at what I saw.  The tables at most restaruants aren't always cleaned with clean rags.  
Now, as she's older and eating some puffs and other finger foods, it's great b/c I can put the food directly on her mat and the cup catches the leftovers!  
I keep ours in a large ziploc bag in my diaper bag so when it's dirty it doesn't get everything else dirty.
It's such a simple concept product, but so GREAT!
The only complaint I have is that sometimes it doesn't stick very well.....

I have been looking for the perfect diaper bag and this is it!!  The description doesn't do the bag justice as it has many features not shown in any of the photographs.  To start there is a large back pocket to put all of your changing needs, which is quick and easy to access.  The heart of the bag contains ample room with six pockets total; two elastic pockets on one side and 4 layered pockets on the other.  There is also a front flap with a magnetic closure with one zippered pocket on the outside and a wallet organizer on the inside...the perfect area for mom's stuff.  There is a cell phone compartment on the front of the bag and a bottle pocket on each side of the bag.  The construction and material are very sturdy and everything closes up nicely so there is no risk of spilliage.  Finally, the graphite and green is very unisex, where many diaper bags are not so father friendly.  I am so pleased with this bag and the price is unbeatable!

I have tried just about every diaper rash cream (desitin, balmex, mustela, vaseline, sprays, gold bond powder, generic brands, etc...), but this is the only brand that truly works.  The oatmeal or whatever secret ingredient it has gets rid of the redness on my daughter's bum in usually one or two changes.  BEST PRODUCT

This stuff works wonders for my son's sensitive bum... and FAST!  We usually see results in just one application - usually by the next changing the irritaion is GONE or nearly so.  It also has a very natural/herbal scent which further outweighs other barrier creams.  It may seem a little pricey on a per ounce comparison, but I've found that I don't need to use as much, which makes that argument mute

We bought this for a trip we will be taking in May but when my daughter saw it she got in it immediately.  She wants to sit in it to watch tv, take walks or to put her dolls in it.  The light weight makes it easy to take and use in more places for me.  This helps with my back problems since I am more likely to have a stoller with me now.  It is easy to open, shut and lock.  I do wish that it had a place to hang or store a smaller baby bag though.  I also like that the ride is smooth for Victoria and she has the option to reclined or sit upright.  The large padded hand grips help to have more control and comfort with the stroller also.

Great buy.  My daughter loves this stroller.  I like the option of the back padding that you can fold during hot season so the air can go though.  Your child never gets hot or sweaty at their back.  I would recommend this stroller.  maneuver really well, I can do it with my 1 hand, fold one hand.  Great, great stroller.

Before my daughter was born, I knew I was determined to breastfeed her.  I read several books and asked a lot of moms what their breastfeeding must-haves were.  Several people mentioned this nursing stool.  I was doubtful about how helpful a little stool could actually be, but I also wanted every resource possible available to help my breastfeeding relationship go smoothly, so I went ahead and bought it.  In the weeks prior to my daughter's birth, my husband assembled the stool and I would use it to prop up my aching feet after a long day at work.  After my baby was born, I set up a little nursing station in my living room, and I found the stool to be an essential item.  Basically it lifted my knees to just the right angle to help prop the baby in the correct position.  I also used a nursing pillow, and between the pillow and the stool, the whole experience was actually very comfortable.  I was able to nurse for long periods of time without feeling any pain or stress from holding the baby in the right position.  I am definitely holding on to this item for use with future babies, and I would recommend it to any new mom who plans to nurse her baby

This gate has some good points and just one negative.

Pros - good price, easy to operate. Mine are very easy on the batteries, I replace them about every 2 months. They are located on the kid's bedroom doorways, about 8' apart from each other. We use them as a double safety for the top of the stairs, and to keep the roaming 22 month old out of his sister's room when she wants some quiet time. 

For those of you who have multiple gates and complain about 1 control unlocking both gates you should know that if you replace the batteries at the same time and arm the first gate it sends out the signal to both gates and programs it to unlock both. So simply set up one gate while the batteries are out of the other, then set up the second gate seperately. I have never had them malfunction following these steps.

Cons: 
I also have had my toddler wedge a knee in the door. I found that this was due to the gate not being tight enough. It was very frustrating and a little scary but we were always able to help him out of the gate by sitting him down and pulling him straight back. We nearly got rid of this gate because of a few times dealing with this. But since we tightened up the pressure on the gate we have had no problems. It has also stripped some of the paint from my doorway where the tension feet are..right down to bare wood. I will have to repaint and patch when these gates come down. The also should be a little taller IMO, and if the gate is not tight enough it can become dislodged and open. Always check the gate when you close it to make sure it IS closed..a few rare occasions I have found it not completely closed. This usually happens when you manually open the gate then try to use the remote button to open it.

Overall, 4 stars. Would be 5 stars if the gate was taller and the bars a little closer to prevent pinching. Good price though and it is put together well

We tried three other brands and types of gates on the market. Two were plastic and the third was a metal gate ordered from one of the pet catalogs costing $66! The two plastic gates each broke within days of being installed and the other metal gate was stiff and hard to use and took over an hour to actually install. This Evenflo Gate was put together, installed and in full use within 30 minutes of arriving and the dogs haven't been able to budge it one inch. Plus it looks good and blends with the taupe ricepaper on the walls. Great product at a bargain price - we're ordering three more

A snap to install, my only complaint is that when you press the button to open the gate, it waits about 5 seconds before you can latch the gate again.

**PROBLEM**

Forget about using the remote if you have more than one of these gates in the house -- one remote will opena ll of them... pretty stupid design. :

We purchased this gate for use with our youngest of four daughters.  The pressure gates we already had were difficult for our 3 and 5 year olds to get pass and it gets difficult constantly lifting them over the gate.  This gate is well worth the money.  The remote unit is on the wall in a place where everyone can reach it, except for the 13 month old of course.  It is so much easier for everyone.  

With all of the use our gate gets, the spot welds broke one day.  You really miss this gate when you have to go back to using a pressure gate again.  I called customer support, concerned because I do longer had my receipt or even the box.  The spot welds breaking loose was a problem they hadn't had reported before (so this apparently isn't a common problem!)  I was told we would receive a new gate within two weeks and the old one would be inspected by engineers to determine what had occured.  I was very impressed!  I will be sure to check out Evenflo products first when purchasing any new child/baby products for their customer support alone.  Service like that is not so common anymore.  Like I said, great concept and service

I have to say this is a better made one than some of the others. My mom purchased this to have in her car in case our daughter is with her. How the cover is designed to fit over the base some of the straps are almost impossible to reach underneath and where it is to be attached.  I had to end up using needlenose pliers to pull the strap thru.
The arm rest raise up. Not sure about the drink holder part...doesn't seem very durable but we will see.
Other than the cover part I feel this will be a good item
