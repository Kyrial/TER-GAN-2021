My husband is a big fan of this instant tea and always claims that it got rid of his cold/sickness right away. I have always thought that he exaggerated it until I was so cold and feeling really sick after a 2 hr working outdoor in the cold. The first thing I did after I came home was making a cup of hot ginger instant tea (which take me about 5 sec) and drank it right way. I have to admit, it is like a miracle! My nose almost stopped running right away. My headache was also so much better. I could feel the warmth running down and really warmed up my whole body. 

The tea is very pleasant, not too spicy and not too sweet either. It is extremely tasty. I highly recommend this tea to anyone who need to go out a lot, or use it to guard you from winter sickness

This has a wonderfully intense ginger flavor, without managing to be overwhelming.  I cannot speak about its effectiveness in combatting motion sickness, though it did do a good job settling an upset stomach.  That being said, whatever ends up getting you interested in this product, whether it be the flavor or the other properties of ginger, this is definitely a candy you will want in your candy dish, desk, etc.  My only suggestion is to buy more than one at a time, because the flavor is so good that you will go through these rather quickly

I love this product.  It is not super sweet like American sweets, but just right.  It tastes like drinking green tea iced tea.  Very refreshing with only one.  These Japanese foods are high on flavor and it makes it so easy to eat just a few.  I am dieting, so I like something I am not prone to over eat.  They do have hydrogenated oils so that is not good, but I hear there is something about possibly getting it out.  Another interesting ingredient was shea great for lotion and a nut butter that tastes good too I know now.  Very good refreshing after meal taste.  One is even satisfiying and I mean one stick. Not one individual pack.  They come in small packs so they are easy to take on the go.  Enjoy

The service from iGourmet is impeccable

Everything arrived in perfect condition i.e. ripe (and therefore "stinky" just like it should be!!)

The Styrofoam packaging was the perfect vessel for delivery; the cheese arrived "alive" from not being over chilled.

I have not had cheese of this quality outside France, and this is the first time I have found "perfect" cheese in the US.

If you like top quality "stinky" cheese this is for you........

When most of reviewers praise other pocky, this is really so much better: it is more slender with richer chocolate. It actually has more sticks than almost all other pocky types. The chocolate is slightly bitter than the red chocolate pocky, but no too much. Very balanced. If you love chocolate, this is definitly better... Worth trying

As it say so astutely on box of glowing color, this yum-yum Pocky is for men only. It not good or happy for womens to consume. Do not dare to ask why for that journey will not be pleasant.  Only accept and then you will see the joys of Pocky.  This Pocky for men.  Get other Pocky for womens.  Then two can be most happiness in joy of whirlwinds

I was expecting a good thing after all the positive reviews.  It was even better than I'd hoped.  The first container was entirely devoted to fluffer nutters.  I had to fight my boyfriend for the second container and he could eat the real stuff if he wanted!

Once I was down to just a little fluff stuck to the sides of the container, I used strawberries (alright, and the occasional finger) to scrape the last of it out.

A great product is one thing, but this company has great customer service, too.  I called the store because I had a question about another one of their products.  They were extraordinarily helpful and friendly.  Even though they were very busy, I wasn't rushed off the phone.  They treated me like my business mattered a great deal to them.  This is a rare thing to find in today's corporate landscape where the customer is treated like the most unimportant cog in the machine

yes!  yes!  yes!  this marshmallow cream is amazing.  i'm diabetic with an enormous sweet tooth and this stuff is a g-dsend.  sooo yummy and sweet without that weird, cloying aftertaste or mouthfeel.  just marshmallow goodness.  i'm sure, as other reviewers have suggested, it has many uses.  maybe i'll discover some of them with my next batch; the first batch got eaten plain -- it was *that* good.  (i am thinking of bringing it camping so that when the rest of the family has their s'mores around the campfire, i can make a little tin foil packet of my own with this, chocolate and graham crackers and rest it in the coals.  how good would that be?!

I have to say, growing up my marshmallow Cream always came out of a jar, so half way through the jar you'd have to put your hand inside and get it all sticky.  Now with this tub with a wide mouth, my hands aren't sticky.  PLUS because it has no carbs or sugar, I can eat more straight then I ever could... without having to worry as much either

If you have to avoid sugar and miss marshmallow life is good again. This marshmallow is delicious, has the perfect consistency and lasts and lasts. Hot chocolate, fluffer butter sandwiches, home made sugar free rocky road ice cream - you can have it all now!!! Plus the people at A Bountiful Harvest are wonderful.

Come on America! What ever happened to trendiness. Albiet I got my Pocky from a local Walmart, but geeze! It is so good and has very few sugars for how much chocolate is on each stick. Sure it is a tad pricy being at around 88 cents for about 14 Pocky sticks, but once you taste it you NEVER will want to go back to Oreos.

I know my gummi's and Haribo gummi's are the only ones worth eating! If I can't find this brand at the store, it's nothing. A little tip: I buy the 5lb. bag at Safeway for under $6! (A much better bargain than here.) They are usually located on the bottom shelf underneath the hanging smaller bags

These gummis are by far the best; the taste is tart and sweet, and the consistency is yes, gummy but not sticky. The bears resist the teeth with a pleasant rubbery consistency. And the outside is lightly dusted to prevent sticking together--however, they will melt with high temperatures in the Texas summer. They are nice mixed in trail mix for hiking, by the way.

A five pound bag is a lot, but if you pack a few every day in the kids' lunch bags, they will disappear. They are great for teaching counting, too. Or getting things done. Put a bowl of gummis out and an empty bowl next to it. When one task is done, put a gummi in the empty bowl. At the end of your list, eat the gummis. Yummi

The first time I encountered Haribo Gummi Bears was when I went to Germany for a semester overseas. I won a bag of these as a classroom prize.

At first, I thought these were going to be ordinary gummy bears, but, boy was I wrong. These candies truly are a step above all other gummy bears. In Germany, this is THE brand of gummy bears. Competitors' bags are sold at much lower prices, but few people buy them - and that's because the difference in quality and taste is noticeable. The other people's reviews regarding sweetness and softness are accurate. Haribo has found the perfect combination.

During the rest of my stay in Germany, I became a huge consumer of Haribo candies. Haribo sells other gummy candies, but their "Gold Bears" are the best.

When I returned to beautiful America, I was disappointed to find that Haribo is not so easy to acquire. They are sold online at other stores at decent prices but after shipping, the cost was quite steep.

I am truly excited to see these bears offered on Amazon with free super-saver shipping.

If you have never had Haribo Gummi Bears, you really need to try some. A 5-pound bag seems like a large quantity, but I promise, you will not be disappointed

I am a huge black licorice fan, however I don't think I'd really experienced black licorice until I had Panda black licorice. Great, intense licorice flavoring, extremely addictive.  If I open up a box, I find it very hard to stop munching until the box is empty!  Delicious

I followed the package instructions and these noodles turned out great!  They do have a different texture than carb noodles.  They are firmer, and more slick.  But these noodles taste great!  They are more than worth the $2 in order to cut the carbs!  I ate them with margarine and garlic salt and I loved them more than regular carb noodles.  Luckily, a local grocery store started selling them, so I no longer have to pay the outrageous shipping price (they are refrigerated)

I was actually anxiously waiting to try these since the reviews were mixed but I am soooooo glad I did try them bec now i am hooked!!!! Yes, they are a bit expensive when compared to pasta but i think of it as paying some extra bucks to remove some pounds off! I make sure I rinse them really well in cold water right before I boil them for around 5 minutes which removes all the bad smell! I just add some marinara sauce and it is a done deal! I found the texture to be actually good , like a firmer version of the ramen noodles! I think these make an excellent snack or meal!

I stumbled on these in Whole Foods and decided to buy a couple of packages.  I have NEVER been disappointed with anything I have eaten them with.  Maybe it's because I am a heck of a cook! :-) This are not pasta they ARE tofu. If you are looking for something to be negative and skeptical about YOU WILL FIND IT.  I could eat these noodles with home made spaghetti sauce every single day!  Go ahead, try them for yourself...If you have an open mind, you will NOT be disappointed!  Also, the shipping should not be a bad reflection on the quality/taste of the product it's self. This stuff is GREAT...look for them in a store near you so you won't have to worry about the shipping...

I lived in Japan for many years & really enjoyed using these "noodles" in soups, stir-fry, Korean-style cooking, etc.  If you are looking for pasta, these may not exactly match your craving, but are nonetheless really versatile!  My advice for those who don't like the smell upon opening the package is to drain them, sprinkle liberally with salt & rub through with clean hands, then rinse in cold water.  This is how they prepare them in Japan - it removes any odor & they are ready to use

I started eating these as a kid and I still love them.  I am not Asain, but I like foods from all over the world.  These candies have a little rice paper edible wrapper.  While the toys moved to stickers now the candy is still really good.  It has a unique flavor and I just cannot get enough of these.  They are pretty wholesome for candy.  They really are a special treat.  I think they are healthier than other candies.  I am not sure what American kids of today would think, but if they are not used to total junk I think they would like them.  These are really special.  The taste is really light.  They are chewy and sticky so you would not want to give them to really little kids for risk of choaking.  I do think they would be healthier than other things and might be nice for a holiday special gift or other special occasion for an older child.  Someone who is age 5 and up would be perfect

I've been snacking on Botan Rice Candy since I was a little girl.  My mom used to pick it up for us every time she visited the Asian grocery store.  And I still have it a few times a year.  This candy is delicious!  Sweet like honey, but not too sweet...chewy like caramel squares, but not sticky.  And the sticker is sometimes a tattoo- bonus!  It's fun

If I could survive on Pocky and pocky alone, I would do it. This is the world's perfect snack food. Strawberry is the best of them all, though I am partial to the coconut and chocolate flavors too. Sweet creamy strawberry-y goodness coats a thin crispy cracker stick, making for a one-of-a-kind taste sensation in your mouth. Plus one tip is uncoated, so you don't even have to get your hands dirty. If you only try one Japanese food, this is the one. Try it, you won't be disappointed

I like this because it tastes like drinking green iced tea.  It has a great taste and is not super sweet.  I find it refreshing and cleansing of the palate.  Unlike the other person I am not addicted, but am satisfied with one piece and that is what is great about so many asian candies.  If you like green tea I think you will like these.  I drink unsweatened tea all the time and this was like drinking it.  Nice refreshing candy.  Individually wrapped like many japanese candies and that makes it easy to eat over time

My Japanese pen pal Y. Yamamoto just adores Strawberry Pocky and tells me they're lovely icebreakers in stressful situations.

Mind you, I'm not sure I should believe Yohko-chan as she describes these situations, many of which involve her flying a space battleship and using time travel in a remarkably casula way, but I must admit they're entertaining reading. and the souvenier she sent me from that space Hot Springs was rather interesting -- although why you would make crocodiles that are just like bananas is completely beyond me.

Still, I want to date her friend Ruuan. She looks hot, in an amazingly ditzy sort of way....

I am a mom of four, who tries to balance a limited grocery budget with the healthiest food that my family can eat.  I keep making more and more changes as I gather more information and products like this become so readily available.  Anyway, I have been concerned about food dyes lately but still wanted my kids to be able to have some kind of a candy treat.  I thought I would give these a try.  I just got them yesterday.  I haven't given any to the kids yet (I am saving them for Christmas), but I also didn't want to wait until then and find out from the kids that they were horrible.  So, I performed my own taste test of three of the flavors, and I found them to be delicious.  I know the kids will love them!

Dealing with an allery to corn isn't easy, but these lollipops sure make it seem a lot easier.  They're wonderfully flavored, organic, and made by a company who honestly cares about its customers.  These are a great find and a staple of my house. They're just awesome, its hard to believe they're corn-free

my friend told me how she loves these YummyEarth lollipops, so I bought a bag to share at work.  everyone loves them like crazy and we're almost done with them in just a few days.  really packed with great flavor.  different than other candy.  very fruity and real tasting, not like overly sugary fake flavor of regular candy.  just awesome taste.  pretty cool, too, that it's organic

This product is great!  I love cinnamon sugar on my toast and bagels, but not all the calories.  I didn't want to just mix splenda and cinnamon together on my own since I didn't know what ratio to use.  I will definitely order this again when the 3 I bought are almost gone

I liked these.  I was prepared for an awful stench upon opening the package, but mine didn't smell at all.  I followed the instructions and was pleasantly suprised by the taste and unique (unique = good) texture.  These noodles weren't like pasta, but they were good.  I'll have no problem eating them agian.  As a matter of fact I thought they were quite delicious

I bought a few bags of these noodles after reading a very favorable review of them on the Hungry Girl website, and I am glad that I did.  They work well in a number of different recipes, are filling, and add a "calcium boost" to the dishes I use them in, for very few calories.  These are not "pasta" type noodles, of course - the texture is different (softer and kind of "slippery"), and they have virtually no flavor of their own - they take on the flavor of whatever sauce or dressing you use with them.  I probably won't use these noodles with European-style or American-style sauces such as marinara or cheese sauce - those types of sauces were created for grain-based pastas, which these are not.  On the other hand, these noodles are fine in such Asian recipes as Pad Thai, Lo Mein and Dan-Dan Noodes (basically, noodles in a spicy peanut or sesame sauce).  There are a lot of Asian-style recipes in cookbooks and on the Internet which are fairly easy to make, taste terrific, and work beautifully with these noodles.  You can prepare yourself a real treat, if you use these noodles in the types of recipes that work well with their texture, and for a fraction of the calories you'd eat if using regular noodles or rice.  In short, if you attempt something like spaghetti with meatballs or chicken cacciatore using these noodles, you're likely to be disappointed, but if you use them in Pad Thai, any type of curry, other Asian dishes, or most soups, you're likely to find yourself enjoying a delicious and wonderfully low-cal, low-carb meal. 

One thing - when you open the bag, there is a slight ammonia-like odor (it smells ammonia-like to me, anyway).  If you rinse the noodles well and then parboil them for a few minutes, as per the package directions, the odor really does disappear.  It is not a strong odor, it won't permeate your kitchen or anything like that, but you will definitely want to rinse and parboil the noodles before using them.  Just follow the package directions

It ain't spaghetti, folks, but used properly it can enhance your eating. It's great in a wet, soupy type dish. Eaten "as is" (after rinsing) the noodles are very soft and tender, too soft to pass for a dry Italian type pasta, unless you always cook dry pasta to death. Boiling them for a minute or two firms them up somewhat, but they never become as firm as a properly cooked dried pasta.

For the reviewer who said that pasta is out due to his/her type 2 diabetes... it's not! I'm in the same boat, and we can still enjoy pasta, we just need to measure it to control the carb servings and always use whole grain types to slow down the sugar load. I weigh out 2 oz. before cooking for 2 carb exchanges (the 1/2 cup serving measurement is absurd because different types of pasta will fill a cup differently), and I use bulkier additions like chunky vegetables and have a big salad on the side.The oil and vinegar salad dressing helps to further temper the blood sugar rush. Of course, if you eat lots of carbs for breakfast and lunch, don't plan on 2 carb servings of pasta for dinner. And I have given up the (white) Italian bread on the side! That's the worst part, but the pasta is at least do-able.

If you've missed your favorite pastas because of your low-carb diet, this definitely is the product for you. Though it doesn't have the starchy quality of pasta, it's a convincing substitute if you're don't mind sacrificing texture for a low-calorie, low-carb meal. Be sure to drain adequately before you top with a sauce, otherwise you end up with a slimy mess. Otherwise, I would recommend this product to anyone who misses pastas because of Atkins, South Beach, etc.

If you're expecting egg pasta made from the finest durum wheat, you'll be disappointed, but if you're a fan of japanese sukiyaki, stir-fry udon and chow fun these low carb subs will be right up your alley.  Also and excellent sub for pad thai dishes.  If the texture doesn't bother you, then go ahead and try it with your favorite western-style dishes.  

Shirataki (shredded konjac) really has no flavor itself, but like tofu, it absorbs flavors extremely well.  In addition to being low in calories and carbs, it's very good for your digestive system!  Eat up

I read about this product on the Hungry Girl website.  It listed Amazon as a supplier.  I read all the reviews and decided to place an order.  It took longer than I expected to arrive, since I had to pay extra shipping I thought it would be here sooner.  The extra shipping must have been  for the cool pack in the box it was shipped in.

The noodles were a little chewier than regular pasta.  But like regular pasta the didn't really have a taste of their own and took on the taste of what ever sauce you use.  I really did like them.  Being diabetic, it is a great pasta alternative that will not raise my blood sugar.  And I didn't find a unpleasant smell when I opened the bag as another reviewer wrote. Just the same I did rinse them well.

I have since found them in a local health food store so I won't have to pay the high shipping any more.  I have not been able to find the spaghetti type anywhere, only the flat noodle type and I would really like to try the spaghetti.  

I would recommend this product to any one that wants a lower carb, lower calorie pasta

Come on America! What ever happened to trendiness. Albiet I got my Pocky from a local Walmart, but geeze! It is so good and has very few sugars for how much chocolate is on each stick. Sure it is a tad pricy being at around 88 cents for about 14 Pocky sticks, but once you taste it you NEVER will want to go back to Oreos.

These gummis are by far the best; the taste is tart and sweet, and the consistency is yes, gummy but not sticky. The bears resist the teeth with a pleasant rubbery consistency. And the outside is lightly dusted to prevent sticking together--however, they will melt with high temperatures in the Texas summer. They are nice mixed in trail mix for hiking, by the way.

A five pound bag is a lot, but if you pack a few every day in the kids' lunch bags, they will disappear. They are great for teaching counting, too. Or getting things done. Put a bowl of gummis out and an empty bowl next to it. When one task is done, put a gummi in the empty bowl. At the end of your list, eat the gummis. Yummi

The first time I encountered Haribo Gummi Bears was when I went to Germany for a semester overseas. I won a bag of these as a classroom prize.

At first, I thought these were going to be ordinary gummy bears, but, boy was I wrong. These candies truly are a step above all other gummy bears. In Germany, this is THE brand of gummy bears. Competitors' bags are sold at much lower prices, but few people buy them - and that's because the difference in quality and taste is noticeable. The other people's reviews regarding sweetness and softness are accurate. Haribo has found the perfect combination.

During the rest of my stay in Germany, I became a huge consumer of Haribo candies. Haribo sells other gummy candies, but their "Gold Bears" are the best.

When I returned to beautiful America, I was disappointed to find that Haribo is not so easy to acquire. They are sold online at other stores at decent prices but after shipping, the cost was quite steep.

I am truly excited to see these bears offered on Amazon with free super-saver shipping.

If you have never had Haribo Gummi Bears, you really need to try some. A 5-pound bag seems like a large quantity, but I promise, you will not be disappointed

I am a huge black licorice fan, however I don't think I'd really experienced black licorice until I had Panda black licorice. Great, intense licorice flavoring, extremely addictive.  If I open up a box, I find it very hard to stop munching until the box is empty!  Delicious

These noodles are traditional for sukiyaki but work well as oriental noodles or even chicken soup noodles. And made of tofu, they won't add carbs to your diet. I find I cannot eat processed starch--upsets my stomach, so these are a total lifesaver. And the slightly slippery soft texture is soothing. Love'em

I was actually anxiously waiting to try these since the reviews were mixed but I am soooooo glad I did try them bec now i am hooked!!!! Yes, they are a bit expensive when compared to pasta but i think of it as paying some extra bucks to remove some pounds off! I make sure I rinse them really well in cold water right before I boil them for around 5 minutes which removes all the bad smell! I just add some marinara sauce and it is a done deal! I found the texture to be actually good , like a firmer version of the ramen noodles! I think these make an excellent snack or meal!

I stumbled on these in Whole Foods and decided to buy a couple of packages.  I have NEVER been disappointed with anything I have eaten them with.  Maybe it's because I am a heck of a cook! :-) This are not pasta they ARE tofu. If you are looking for something to be negative and skeptical about YOU WILL FIND IT.  I could eat these noodles with home made spaghetti sauce every single day!  Go ahead, try them for yourself...If you have an open mind, you will NOT be disappointed!  Also, the shipping should not be a bad reflection on the quality/taste of the product it's self. This stuff is GREAT...look for them in a store near you so you won't have to worry about the shipping...

My husband is a big fan of this instant tea and always claims that it got rid of his cold/sickness right away. I have always thought that he exaggerated it until I was so cold and feeling really sick after a 2 hr working outdoor in the cold. The first thing I did after I came home was making a cup of hot ginger instant tea (which take me about 5 sec) and drank it right way. I have to admit, it is like a miracle! My nose almost stopped running right away. My headache was also so much better. I could feel the warmth running down and really warmed up my whole body. 

The tea is very pleasant, not too spicy and not too sweet either. It is extremely tasty. I highly recommend this tea to anyone who need to go out a lot, or use it to guard you from winter sickness

I bought this over 6 months ago from an Asian food store. It is so good! It's really cool how the rice paper melts in your mouth. I gave some to my little cousins and they loved it. It's a wonderful thing to suck on and it's not very sticky either. It also comes with a sticker or a tatoo.

This has a wonderfully intense ginger flavor, without managing to be overwhelming.  I cannot speak about its effectiveness in combatting motion sickness, though it did do a good job settling an upset stomach.  That being said, whatever ends up getting you interested in this product, whether it be the flavor or the other properties of ginger, this is definitely a candy you will want in your candy dish, desk, etc.  My only suggestion is to buy more than one at a time, because the flavor is so good that you will go through these rather quickly

I love this product.  It is not super sweet like American sweets, but just right.  It tastes like drinking green tea iced tea.  Very refreshing with only one.  These Japanese foods are high on flavor and it makes it so easy to eat just a few.  I am dieting, so I like something I am not prone to over eat.  They do have hydrogenated oils so that is not good, but I hear there is something about possibly getting it out.  Another interesting ingredient was shea great for lotion and a nut butter that tastes good too I know now.  Very good refreshing after meal taste.  One is even satisfiying and I mean one stick. Not one individual pack.  They come in small packs so they are easy to take on the go.  Enjoy

I like this because it tastes like drinking green iced tea.  It has a great taste and is not super sweet.  I find it refreshing and cleansing of the palate.  Unlike the other person I am not addicted, but am satisfied with one piece and that is what is great about so many asian candies.  If you like green tea I think you will like these.  I drink unsweatened tea all the time and this was like drinking it.  Nice refreshing candy.  Individually wrapped like many japanese candies and that makes it easy to eat over time

I don't even like tea, but these candies are delicious. On first taste, they're a little bitter and weird tasting as you absorb the green tea powder coating. As you continue eating the candy, it develops into a chewy tasty gummy type candy. Very tasty and definitely grows on you! One warning, they're not a healthy snack, so watch out how many the you and the kids eat

this is my first asian food purchase with pier mall, and my first review here at amazon as well... these matcha candies get better and better with each one- i can see how they could become quite addictive! individually wrapped and matcha powder coated, this flavor takes some getting used... the outside is kind of hard underneath the powder, and then the inside is all chewy and decadent- YUMMY - actually, i think i'm already addicted!! also, nice to travel with or put in your bag- these won't melt or make a mess.

The taste is really great it is a bitter chocolate and tastes like one that is expensive high end to me.  Mens is the name perhaps because the 2 individual packs are so big.  When I first saw that I wondered if this was a musk candy like they have in australia.  Nope these are for everyone.  It is an easy way to have an easy dose of chocolate.  I cannot eat a whole pack just one stick at a time.  Share this with some friends.  Would be fun to have these for a party

When most of reviewers praise other pocky, this is really so much better: it is more slender with richer chocolate. It actually has more sticks than almost all other pocky types. The chocolate is slightly bitter than the red chocolate pocky, but no too much. Very balanced. If you love chocolate, this is definitly better... Worth trying

As it say so astutely on box of glowing color, this yum-yum Pocky is for men only. It not good or happy for womens to consume. Do not dare to ask why for that journey will not be pleasant.  Only accept and then you will see the joys of Pocky.  This Pocky for men.  Get other Pocky for womens.  Then two can be most happiness in joy of whirlwinds

My Japanese pen pal Y. Yamamoto just adores Strawberry Pocky and tells me they're lovely icebreakers in stressful situations.

Mind you, I'm not sure I should believe Yohko-chan as she describes these situations, many of which involve her flying a space battleship and using time travel in a remarkably casula way, but I must admit they're entertaining reading. and the souvenier she sent me from that space Hot Springs was rather interesting -- although why you would make crocodiles that are just like bananas is completely beyond me.

Still, I want to date her friend Ruuan. She looks hot, in an amazingly ditzy sort of way....

First of all, I do agree with the above reviewers who thought this wasn't a great fruit dip. Second, there's very little marshmallow flavor-this stuff is NOTHING like regular marshmallow fluff. 

However, I still give this 5 stars, because it's got features you can't get anywhere else. The texture is smooth pudding (Grainy reviewer perhaps ate his past the expiration date?) and that's mainly how I use this. Because of the slightly sharp taste of the cellulose, this dip lends itself very well to making citrus puddings (just add about 1/4 cup lemon concentrate and stir, doesn't get any easier than that). I also use it to make cheesecake and other dessert recipes. 

To actually make a good fruit dip out of this, try mixing it with yogurt or cream cheese

Can't go wrong here.  Intense flavor and impressive ingredients.  I love 'em and everyone I give them to loves them.  Get a load of these ingredients:  organic evaporated cane juice, organic tapioca syrup (no sulfites added), non-GMO citric acid (from non-GMO sugar beet), organic & natural flavors* (watermelon, pomegranate, orange oils, lemon oils, raspberry), organic & natural colors (red cabbage, purple carrots). * = Cheeky Lemon, Wet-Face Watermelon, Pomegranate Pucker, Orange Squeeze, & upcoming Mango Tango flavor contain some amount of orange or lemon or citrus oils (0.58% of the natural flavor formula of watermelon is derived from lemon oil). Safflower oil is in the Wet-Face Watermelon and upcoming Mango Tango.  HOLY COW!!!  AND THEY'RE REALLY REALLY GOOD!

This is the candy our two boys ask for the most. And their friends (and their parents) love them, too.  We gave them out for Halloween and had rave reviews back from neighbors. It's great to be able to give out candy to trick or treaters and to guests that we know won't hurt anyone (no peanuts, no corn, no artificial anything). Just great taste!  Rock on, Yummy Earth.

I am a mom of four, who tries to balance a limited grocery budget with the healthiest food that my family can eat.  I keep making more and more changes as I gather more information and products like this become so readily available.  Anyway, I have been concerned about food dyes lately but still wanted my kids to be able to have some kind of a candy treat.  I thought I would give these a try.  I just got them yesterday.  I haven't given any to the kids yet (I am saving them for Christmas), but I also didn't want to wait until then and find out from the kids that they were horrible.  So, I performed my own taste test of three of the flavors, and I found them to be delicious.  I know the kids will love them!

Dealing with an allery to corn isn't easy, but these lollipops sure make it seem a lot easier.  They're wonderfully flavored, organic, and made by a company who honestly cares about its customers.  These are a great find and a staple of my house. They're just awesome, its hard to believe they're corn-free

my friend told me how she loves these YummyEarth lollipops, so I bought a bag to share at work.  everyone loves them like crazy and we're almost done with them in just a few days.  really packed with great flavor.  different than other candy.  very fruity and real tasting, not like overly sugary fake flavor of regular candy.  just awesome taste.  pretty cool, too, that it's organic

This is a very good product. It keeps you from having to try to mix your own cinnamon and sweetener. It's good for a lot of things for those who can't have sugar. My favorite is cinnamon toast. I will reorder it when I am out of it. It's so nice to have something with Splenda instead of aspartame

This product is great!  I love cinnamon sugar on my toast and bagels, but not all the calories.  I didn't want to just mix splenda and cinnamon together on my own since I didn't know what ratio to use.  I will definitely order this again when the 3 I bought are almost gone

I bought a few bags of these noodles after reading a very favorable review of them on the Hungry Girl website, and I am glad that I did.  They work well in a number of different recipes, are filling, and add a "calcium boost" to the dishes I use them in, for very few calories.  These are not "pasta" type noodles, of course - the texture is different (softer and kind of "slippery"), and they have virtually no flavor of their own - they take on the flavor of whatever sauce or dressing you use with them.  I probably won't use these noodles with European-style or American-style sauces such as marinara or cheese sauce - those types of sauces were created for grain-based pastas, which these are not.  On the other hand, these noodles are fine in such Asian recipes as Pad Thai, Lo Mein and Dan-Dan Noodes (basically, noodles in a spicy peanut or sesame sauce).  There are a lot of Asian-style recipes in cookbooks and on the Internet which are fairly easy to make, taste terrific, and work beautifully with these noodles.  You can prepare yourself a real treat, if you use these noodles in the types of recipes that work well with their texture, and for a fraction of the calories you'd eat if using regular noodles or rice.  In short, if you attempt something like spaghetti with meatballs or chicken cacciatore using these noodles, you're likely to be disappointed, but if you use them in Pad Thai, any type of curry, other Asian dishes, or most soups, you're likely to find yourself enjoying a delicious and wonderfully low-cal, low-carb meal. 

One thing - when you open the bag, there is a slight ammonia-like odor (it smells ammonia-like to me, anyway).  If you rinse the noodles well and then parboil them for a few minutes, as per the package directions, the odor really does disappear.  It is not a strong odor, it won't permeate your kitchen or anything like that, but you will definitely want to rinse and parboil the noodles before using them.  Just follow the package directions

It ain't spaghetti, folks, but used properly it can enhance your eating. It's great in a wet, soupy type dish. Eaten "as is" (after rinsing) the noodles are very soft and tender, too soft to pass for a dry Italian type pasta, unless you always cook dry pasta to death. Boiling them for a minute or two firms them up somewhat, but they never become as firm as a properly cooked dried pasta.

For the reviewer who said that pasta is out due to his/her type 2 diabetes... it's not! I'm in the same boat, and we can still enjoy pasta, we just need to measure it to control the carb servings and always use whole grain types to slow down the sugar load. I weigh out 2 oz. before cooking for 2 carb exchanges (the 1/2 cup serving measurement is absurd because different types of pasta will fill a cup differently), and I use bulkier additions like chunky vegetables and have a big salad on the side.The oil and vinegar salad dressing helps to further temper the blood sugar rush. Of course, if you eat lots of carbs for breakfast and lunch, don't plan on 2 carb servings of pasta for dinner. And I have given up the (white) Italian bread on the side! That's the worst part, but the pasta is at least do-able.

 Having begged a local super market WEGMANS in Buffalo NY suburbs,I found this product in the refrigerated isle w/yogurt and procesed and packaged ready to eat heat and serve items.
 Texture was not exactley what I expected,but knowing that being a type II diabetic put regular spagetti out of reach (too high in carbs.)I ate the treat with my favorite sauce,then proceeded to put on my shoes and drive directley to the supermarket to purchase another pound of SHIRATAKI Spagetti for my next planned sauce meal.
 This product is great for me because I eat alone several times a week , it is easy to prepare and is satisfying .
 I do have a problem with the high cost $1.99 per pound,but I will use this product again just not as often as I would like.

If you've missed your favorite pastas because of your low-carb diet, this definitely is the product for you. Though it doesn't have the starchy quality of pasta, it's a convincing substitute if you're don't mind sacrificing texture for a low-calorie, low-carb meal. Be sure to drain adequately before you top with a sauce, otherwise you end up with a slimy mess. Otherwise, I would recommend this product to anyone who misses pastas because of Atkins, South Beach, etc.

yes!  yes!  yes!  this marshmallow cream is amazing.  i'm diabetic with an enormous sweet tooth and this stuff is a g-dsend.  sooo yummy and sweet without that weird, cloying aftertaste or mouthfeel.  just marshmallow goodness.  i'm sure, as other reviewers have suggested, it has many uses.  maybe i'll discover some of them with my next batch; the first batch got eaten plain -- it was *that* good.  (i am thinking of bringing it camping so that when the rest of the family has their s'mores around the campfire, i can make a little tin foil packet of my own with this, chocolate and graham crackers and rest it in the coals.  how good would that be?!

WOW! What else can I say. This is some amazing tasting marshmallow. I made fluffer nutter sandwiches for the first time in almost 10 years! I never thought I would be able to do that again! I don't know what amazed me more, the incredible taste and marshmallow made without sugar and other artificial flavors or the fact that when I called to find out if I could buy it local I was informed that it was only available direct from this company and that they would be making fresh marshmallow the next day if I wanted to order more.....you mean it doesnt spend 6 months in a warehouse and a couple of months on a supermarket shelf? WOW! This really is the best thing since sliced bread, at least in my book it is. I was also told it works well to make rice crispy treats, I'll try that with my next tub! I'm so excited about finding this little treat

If you have to avoid sugar and miss marshmallow life is good again. This marshmallow is delicious, has the perfect consistency and lasts and lasts. Hot chocolate, fluffer butter sandwiches, home made sugar free rocky road ice cream - you can have it all now!!! Plus the people at A Bountiful Harvest are wonderful.

****
Tazo Assorted Black and Green Teas and Herbal Infusions includes one or two of each:
AWAKE:  plain ordinary black tea, a little bitter
CALM:  nice chamomile tea
CHAI BLACK TEA:  an okay chai black tea with caffeine
CHINA GREEN TIPS:  great green tea experience, Tazo's best, no "natural flavorings"
DECAFFEINATED CHAI: an okay chai black tea without caffeine
EARL GREY BLACK TEA:  a disappointing perfumy, intense, black tea experience 
LOTUS:  decaf green tea with lotus flower, one of my favorite Tazo's
PASSION HERBAL INFUSION:  hibiscus-y, intense, caffeine-free, and luxurious
WILD SWEET ORANGE:  orange herbal tea, some complex overtones perhaps
ZEN:  mild, relaxed green tea

Their ingredients include: black tea, green tea, hibiscus flowers, chamomile flowers, lemongrass, citric acid, natural flavors, spearmint leaves, blackberry leaves, cinnamon, rooibos, ginger root, rose hips, orange peel, rose petals, licorice root, safflower, black pepper, lemon verbena leaves, cardamom, cloves, peppermint leaves, chicory, sarsaparilla root, lemon balm leaf, star anise, and red poppy flowers. 

Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea. In general I'm not a big fan of tea with flavorings added, preferring the subtleness and authentic taste of the real thing.

Overall, the green teas seem good. The herbal infusions are fine. The black teas tend to turn bitter if you don't brew them very briefly...even then they have bitter overtones. Tazo's assortment, and Tazo teas in general, are fine---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not anywhere near as good as Numi, or Aspen, or other super premium teas made with only "real" ingredients and minus all of the flavorings. I'm more used to these high quality teas, which Tazo attempts to be, but disappoints...so overall Tazo Assorted gets a 3.5 to a 4. For this review, I'm rounding up, since so many people seem to enjoy these teas, and I'm in the clear minority. If your tea experience so far is drinking commercial teas of a lower quality, no doubt Tazo's teas will appeal to you, as they are a great improvement. They have a lot of variety and many interesting tea experiences. If you don't enjoy Tazo's teas, though, know that there are many, many teas made with all real ingredients, teas that cost only a fraction more, that may be just the thing you were looking for.

This is one of the nicest tea assortments to keep on hand for yourself or visitors.

Awake is a great quality, sweet black Assam tea. By sweet, I mean it is not too astringent or bitter.
Calm is a chamomile-lavender blend, very distinctive

There is a green tea, a mint, and other flavors that will please nearly anyone. You can try these teas to see what are your favorites (the fine Earl Grey?) and this is also great to keep in your office or home for treating guests to whatever tea they may prefer

My first Tazo experience included a box of interesting items from a friend and packets of Tazo Green Ginger tea, which was slightly bitter and delicious with orange blossom honey.
 
This box of Assorted Teas: 

Awake - Keeps you very, very awake!
Calm - Chamomile
China Green Tips
Earl Grey - Perfumed
Tazo Chai - Spicy
Passion - hibiscus flowers and orange for a calming blend
Decaffeinated Tazo Chai
Wild Sweet Orange - really delicious when blended with Lotus and poured over ice
Lotus
Zen - Nice alternative to black tea and has a lemon verbena,
spearmint and lemongrass twist. 

The ingredients include: Black tea, green tea, hibiscus flowers, chamomile flowers, lemongrass, spearmint leaves, blackberry leaves, cinnamon, Rooibos, Gingerroot, rose hips, orange peel, rose petals, licorice root, safflowers, black pepper, lemon verbena leaves, cardamom, cloves, peppermint leaves, chicory, sarsaparilla root, lemon balm leaf, star anise and red poppy flowers. 

I use 16 ounces of water and two tea bags for each experience. When you drink these teas you can transcend reality for moments at a time and that is all the truth I need about these teas. Some of these teas even evoke a sense of wonder. 

Warning: HIGHLY ADDICTIVE TEAS. Once you taste these teas, you will want to try them all and forever be on a search for new Tazo teas. Fortunately they have enough tea blends to entertain you for years.

If you're doing a low-carb diet or looking for snack foods that won't trigger a glycemic reaction, try these amazing cheese snacks.  They are very delicate and pastry-like, crumbling in your mouth. Very savory -- no sweetness. Aunt Lizzie is on to something, and these are a no-compromise low-carb snack

I used to buy this tea when I was a kid, and could no longer get it.  Found it at Amazon, and it couldn't have been easier to get.  This is wonderful, aromatic tea that makes the whole house smell great when you brew it, and it's so delicious - falls in the category of "comfort food"

My first experiance with MarketSpice Tea was on a cold day in Alaska. It's warming, tastes great, and is just what's needed on a cold day. 

I discribe the tea as orange flavored with a "bite" It's aroma fills a room creating a warm feeling

My husband and I were introduced to Market Spice Tea in 1984 while we were living for a few months in Seattle.  We loved it and, upon our return to Jamesville, NY, begain to regularly order it.  Many of our friends now order it, too.  It is an ideal hot drink in the winter and equally good iced in the summer.  23 years and counting it is still our favorite tea

Market Spice Tea is the name of the signature blend and the tea company that has been producing it since the early 1900's in Pike Place Market in Seattle. It is black tea flavored with cinnamon, orange peel and essential oils. It is naturally sweet but contains no sugar or sweetener. 

Many people who don't like tea, love it. It is very fragrant and is great hot or iced. If you are used to drinking black tea with no flavor or sweetener you may prefer to blend it with a plain black tea as it is a very strongly flavored tea. Taste it before sweetening it. 

You should buy it in small quantities because it contains no preservatives and the citrus oils can go "off" after six months or so. You should also make sure not to store it or serve it in plastic or styrofoam as the citrus oils react with them.

Tea, of course, is a matter of taste and this one fits my taste to a tee (p.i.). I'm generally not a tea drinker but was first given this product as a gift. That was five years ago and I'm hooked. We even moved to Europe and I get it sent over here

I lived in Seattle for almost 20 years.  However, in all that time, and even going down to the Pike Place Market at least 2 or 3 times a year (we lived far east of town), I never "knowingly" drank MarketSpice Tea.  However, we moved to North Carolina and "discovered" this wonderful drink.  We also became avid tea drinkers.  A good part of that conversion, was due to MarketSpice Tea.

The flavors are spicey, pungent, smack you up side the head intense.  If you like Lipton, you won't like this.  We use the loose tea only.  Yes, it's a little more of a hassle compared to tea bags, but worth it due to the freshness, flavor, etc.

Also, until the our last purchase, which was from Amazon, we always ordered from MarketSpice themselves.  They're great people, they always shipped what I wanted, etc.  I'll never buy from them directly again.  They don't want to move into the 21st Century when it concerns automation and I respect that.  However, I have.  Amazon gives me the capability to do both; order my favorite tea and do so online, with a company that remembers my address, credit card, etc.

I can wholeheartdly recommend this product and ordering through Amazon.  If you like tea, you owe it to yourself to try this product.

My sister (who reviewed the MST bags) turned me on to this tea in January.

I was a chai girl up to that point, a cup in the morning.  I could generally take it or leave it.

Now no day is complete without my beloved MST.  I began with bags, which are amazing.  I upped it to loose tea pound bags and have become a total tea person.  I do believe I will branch out this time and order some rooibos and green versions--may as well make the shipping charge worth the time.

I can't say enough about this sweet, spicy stuff.  It needs nothing but one enormous cup because a little one just won't do.  Prepare to become addicted.  Oh, and I've lost a lot of weight, too, because I no longer drink coffee with creamers and truly have no sweet cravings anymore.  If that doesn't justify buying it by the pound, nothing will!  Enjoy this amazing brew!  And share it with a friend

Of all teas I've tried, this is my favorite; sweet, powerful, and fragrant, MarketSpice is the answer for many moods and cravings.  I prefer this tea hot, steeped for 5+ minutes, but its good cold as well-although I've found adding any sweeteners to this tea can make it too overwhelming.  Be warned: if you only like very subtle white teas, this may not be for you . . . but it has converted many a non-tea-drinker friend of mine into looseleaf addicts

I've been trying to buy this off the shelf and just could not find it (for, like, 2 years).  I mainly wanted it for texture -- table salt is not fine enough.  This stuff is so fine it completely changes the flavors.  I wouldn't have believed it myself

This is a great product.  It's texture makes it perfect for other things besides popcorn.  With salt in so many products, I don't worry about the lack of iodine in this salt.  After all, it's not like you eat it everyday.  In fact, it sticks so well you can actually use less.  Good product

I love this salt and use it on my french fries as well as on popcorn.  It is not as good as fleur de sel or some of the other "gourmet" salts, but it is only 15 cents per ounce, not 15 dollars.  Note that this salt is flaked, unlike the normal crystals for which Diamond Salt is known.  It absolutely CLINGS to the surface of the popcorn, fries, and other similarly-textured foods MUCH better.  It has a cleaner taste than some of the brown or grey sea salts and CLEAN is always good in my book.  

As a treat, I sometimes Iick the tip of my index finger, sprinkle a little of this on it, and then pretend like I'm getting ready to do a mini tequilla shooter, but without the lime.  Almost like a couple of hours on the beach.

I can only give it four stars instead of five because it is NOT IODIZED and you could end  up looking just like a frog with big goiter things on your neck if you don't get enough iodine.  This is not a problem for people who eat a lot of seafood, but if you live in the Midwest far from the ocean it could cause some difficulties

Try something different.  Forget microwave popcorn for a few weeks and try this four-pack just once.  At the very least, you'll have a new food experience, but what you might get is a new family tradition.  It's worth it.

My wife and I received a four-pack of Fireworks Popcorn last year with these four flavors, and because we are huge fans of stovetop-popping popcorn, it was a definite treat.  We love watching movies, and it's a weekend tradition to make a giant tub of popcorn and jump on the couch.

This 4-pack is a fantastic way to discover the differences in types of popcorn, and there really are subtle differences.  There is a description of the flavor on each bottle, and the bottles also tell you about the size and robustness of the finished product.  

As gourmet as any other gourmet popcorn I've ever tried, the kernels pop up nice and big and almost every kernel pops.  The flavors augment a good low-fat butter spray if that's your fancy.  I'm very much looking forward to receiving the 8-flavor sampler!

Personally, I pop mine in olive oil with a few dashes of garlic-infused oil and/or the red spicy olive oil and a little salt.  That is something you can't do in a microwave!  If you've never popped popcorn on a stove before and you're intimidated... no worries.  Pour in enough popcorn to cover the bottom of the pot, add enough olive oil cover up about half the height of the kernels, shake it over the heat until the popping almost stops, and pour out the popcorn into a bowl asap.  Practice makes perfect, and you don't need much practice at all... maybe just one try!

Honestly, for the labor of about 90 seconds on the stove and one pot to wash, you turn an evening of TV-viewing or movie watching into an event.  The kids will love it, and as a grown-up kid, I highly recommend it.  I have fond memories of my dad making popcorn for the three kids on Saturday nights, and this is a good product to make those memories

I bought these steaks the other day and cooked them on Easter for my wife and I.  All I can say is, UMMMMMMMMMMM!  With a lite coating of koshers salt and pepper, drizzeled a little bit of EVOO ontop and layed them on the grill on a nice high flame.  They were cooked to perfection in about 10 minutes!  I just went back and orderd 12 more since they are on sale right now

There is no better way to drive home T.S. Eliot's "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" than to hold a peach and read:

"Shall I part my hair behind? Do I dare to eat a peach?	[CHOMP]
I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach."
(And shall I dare yet again to eat a peach and teach?) [MUNCH MUNCH]
"I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each."
(But I do not care to preach; I only dare to eat a peach.) [SLURP]

It gives me an intelligent excuse to snack while I'm lecturing

On a hot summer's day, after a hard day at work, there's nothing I want more than a delicious fruit from the beautiful Prunus persica. Amazon offers this convenient 4-pack, great for sharing with your crew.

The scrumptious peach is one of my top 10 favorite fruits, right behind Bananas, Strawberries, Apples, Grapes, Watermelon, Tomatoes, Blueberries, Blackberries and Nectarines.  Then you've got the peach.  Georgia knew what it was doing when it was selecting it's state fruit!

If you could condense heaven into a colorful, 3" diameter sphere, it would be a peach.  They are candies that grow on trees, are picked by angel-elves, and teleported directly to your local grocery store to avoid blemishes.  One day I was eating a peach while walking downhill and caused a peach-juice-slide.  Everybody on the sidewalk jumped on the slide and it carried them down to a radiant peach-pool at the bottom, which everyone splashed into with a wave of orgasmic bliss.
Said best by the Presidents of the United States of America,  "Nature's candy in my hand, can or pie.

Like an apricot, but better, in my opinion. The downy fuzz, the sweet juicy flesh, there really is nothing like a good peach. I think they are best on their own, though some like to cut them up in a fruit salad or make a peach melba. That is fine, but I would strongly advise against cooking them. In my opinion, this is a waste of a good peach. A friend of mine swears by his baked peaches with demerera sugar and cinnamon, but he is a savage and a charlatan.

To conclude, peaches are without doubt one of the finest fruits around. There are few things as satisfying as a sweet ripe peach on a sunny day.

Earl Grey is supposedly the second most popular tea in the world. Traditionally Earl Grey is created from a blend of black teas, usually Chinese and Indian teas, sometimes with a smokey flavor, and scented with the citrus fruit bergamot. Earl Grey tea has an interesting history. Legend has it that the first tea scented with bergamot oil was presented to Lord Grey from a Chinese mandarin whose son was saved from drowning by one of Lord Grey's men. Twinings and Jacksons of Piccadilly both claim to be the first to have commercially blended this tea.

Tazo shows considerable expertise in the blend of this top quality tea. The black teas utilized are as the box states "the worlds most sought after teas from the high-elevation gardens of Nuwara Eliya, Uva and Dimbula in Sri Lanka and Assam in northeast India." They provide the perfect complement to the strong bergamot essence in this blend. The fragrance is powerfully floral, in particular lavender, citrus, and the woodsy-malt scent of premium black tea. The flavor of this splendid potion is rich and perfumed. A tasty sensual delight!

Earl Grey is traditionally served black, sometimes with lemon. I prefer it with cream. On a warning note, if you keep this tea in the cupboard for too long it will get old--the taste becomes very thin and harsh. Brew it from fresh teabags and you won't be disappointed

I'm a great fan of Earl Grey tea and have enjoyed starting my morning with a cup o' the grand stuff for nearly fifteen years. As it happens I am in very good company in this practice along with the likes of Captain Picard and the eponymous Earl Charles Grey himself. Earl Grey is one of the more popular and well-known kinds of tea in the world and deservedly so. Despite general belief, Earl Grey is not a tea varietal at all, but simply ordinary black tea infused with bergamot, a citrus flavor from the rind of the fruit. Try your cup with a few drops of fresh lemon juice for some occasional, yet delicious, variety. It is also pretty neat to watch the lemon juice lighten the tea from dark brown to yellow as the citric acid reacts with the blend!

The Tazo version of Earl Grey is one of the best I have ever tasted. Perfectly balanced, light, aromatic.....it's the perfect start to a morning

These truffles are very, very sweet and very, very rich.  The powdered sugar forms a thin, crisp shell around a thick layer of creamy white chocolate which is filled by a dark chocolate/champagne ganache.  I don't hesitate to offer them to friends because nobody eats more than one or two at a time.  They're just that rich.  

I recommend them for a totally luxurious experience, especially if you are giving small gift boxes w/ only a few chocolates.  I don't recommend for people who prefer their chocolate less sweet.  Actually, they are a bit too sweet for me, but I gave five stars because the product description warned me and they're still really good.  People who have a bigger sweet tooth than mine probably won't share.

The packaging is a gold box, wrapped in blue and white Leonidas paper with a gilt deep purple box.  For shipping, the package was placed inside a sturdy styrofoam shell.  Mine arrived within three days and looked like I'd purchased it at the store to give as a gift

An incredibly refreshing drink when iced! Mix in a teaspoon of honey while your tea is warm and then pour over a generous amount of ice. Because of the ice, use two bags and steep for three minutes or more depending on your taste. You will be pleasantly surprised

The sugar was perfect, I ordered it to go on a cookie I make only at Christmas time.  The cookie is an almond flavored one that you make by chiliing the dough and then cutting off a small piece which you make into a ball and then roll by hand out so it is about 9 inches long.  You try to keept it a little thicker in the very middle so when you twist it, it has a tapered look.  You leave the top with a small opening so you can put a pretty ribbon thru it like it can be hung on the tree.  When they are cooked and still warm you put a thin coating on them of powdered sugar and almond flavoring and water and when they are still sticky, you sprinkle the sugar on.  They came out beautiful, I then put them in an old cookie tin and serve them up to company, they think I am soooooo talented and it is so easy

Very sophisticated, complex flavor not normally found in a mix. Great alone, or as a base for your own creative additions. It gets so thick, it could be reduced a bit further and used as a bean dip. I added more water at the end of cooking for a looser, soupier consistency. We finished each bowl with a sprinkling of chopped jalapeos, cilantro and scallions which added a hit of brightness to the smoky undertones. 

I can't wait to try the other flavors I ordered! This Soup was favorably reviewed by all ages in my kitchen, and that doesn't happen often...

I love chocolate, and always buy the 70%-on up variety's so I looked forward to trying these.I expected some bitterness, but  these tasted (when eaten raw) like burnt chocolate nuts.I still prefer to eat them this way though

True they are a bit bitter, but not TOO bitter and not nearly as bitter as unsweetened baker's chocolate! There are also some taste components I noticed that I've never noticed with processed chocolate, a delicate floral essence and flavor that adds character. I was also surprised to find that raw cacao smells and looks like cooked chocolate, I thought the smell and brown colour came mostly from the cooking process.

I want to try grinding them up and sweetening with agave nectar, a delicious sweetener with a low glycemic index. I tried sweetening a ground up mix with stevia, I think I might've used too much and I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS! Stevia is a good sweetener for a lot of foods, but using too much leaves a bitter aftertaste.

I'd recommend this product to anybody who likes chocolate, especially raw foodists and chocolate connoisseurs. Enjoy

I'm very happy to have discovered these & will definitely continue to use them in baking, it helps me cut back on the semi-sweet choc morsels with a healthier alternative. 

As far as eating them raw - I don't recommend it at all!!! Very bitter taste raw. Maybe some would enjoy it, but I would venture a guess that it's a minority of people rather than a majority

Rings-Ding's are the best snacks out there for many a reasons. First off, they are the best after dinner snacks out there. It's really like a cake, just more condensed and not as fatty or filling. Also, these things are addicting. In my life, I cannot even count how much packs I have consumed, since I have been eating these things everyday since I was young, and let's just say now I am very old. If you cannot afford drugs, then go for the ring-ding's. The only negative about these things if there isn't enough cream, then you get a mouthful of chocolate. Most people I know like the chocolate, but I personally would not like a mouthful of it. Another bad thing is in the summer, they are melted and can only be slightly revived if refrigerated. They kind of lose that good flavor edge in the summer, which makes this the perfect snack for the winter.

Alright...the anatomy of a ring-ding (DUN-DUN-DUN). First off, you get a chocolatey outside that is pretty soft. In the center is a creamy sensation (sorry if that sounded dirty...get your mind out of the gutter) that really makes this product go from good to great. Put that together and you get probably the best snack out there right now. They come two in a pack and are made by Drake's. Usually, Drake's is in the shadow of Hostess, yet I feel Drake's destroys Hostess in terms of their cakes. If you are actually reading this, please don't destroy me for saying that Ring-Ding's totally annihilates anything Hostess has ever put out. Wow...I managed to make a food product two paragraphs long (two short paragraphs I should say). I would put the whole history of the Ring-Ding in, but that would probably be taking someone else's work. I guess I'll stop now. Anyway, Ring-Ding's for the win!!

In many languages around the world, "chai" simply means "tea." In India, however, the word denotes a specialty that to tea lovers even in the West is fast becoming what cappuccino already is to coffee lovers: spiced milk tea. 

Chai comes in a variety of recipes that differ from region to region, although traditionally it consists of a blend of black tea, rich milk, various spices and a sweetner. The spices most commonly used are cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and pepper; Tazo's very peppery Chai adds rooibos, vanilla, star anise and chicory to the traditional recipe. 

You should always have this tea with real sugar, even if you have all your regular tea without any kind of sweetener, because only sugar will bring out the full flavor of the spices. And if you like your store-bought Chai, maybe you'll one day try brewing chai from fresh black tea and spices, too! Namaste ..

****
Tazo's Chai Black Tea is an enjoyable chai experience for the most part. On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a rich blend of teas and spices in the style of the hill dwellers of the Himalayas." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Chai as "cinnamon, creamy, sweet spice" and "medium-bodied yet full-flavored, with the spicy kick of cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, and black pepper. Tazo describes the aroma as "sweet, spice". Those are pretty accurate. The black tea "blend" is a little bitter, though, even with minimal brewing. It's a real trick to get it to brew long enough to get to experience the flavor from the spices without having the tea turn bitter.


The ingredients in Chai are: black teas, ginger, cinnamon, black pepper, cardamom, cloves, and star anise. It is caffeinated. 

Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.

I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Chai gets only four stars.

Whatever that thing is that hot sauce does for you, Dave's does it double.  I have also found that Dave's steak sauce makes a fabulous "secret ingredient" (in small doses) to spaghetti sauce, stews, anything that improves with a tiny bit of heat (think tabasco only with flavor)

THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I AM ABOUT TO PURCHASE OMAHA STEAKS.
THE FIRST WAS THE PROMOTION ON THE TOP SIRLOIN AND BURGERS WITH A COUPLE OF "FREE GIFTS".
I BRIEFLY THOUGHT THE SHIPPING WAS A BIT STIFF,.... BUT THE ORDER CAME IN A STURDY COOLER WITH DRY ICE.
THE QUALITY OF THE STEAKS AND BURGERS WAS THE BEST WE HAVE TASTED IN A GOOD WHILE.  I WOULD NOT SAY THAT THEY ARE THE BEST I HAVE EVER EATEN.... BUT, I WOULD SAY THEY WERE WORTH THE MONEY WE PAID. MY ORDER HAD INSTRUCTIONS THAT IF YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED..... THEY WILL REFUND YOU YOUR MONEY OR SEND MORE STEAKS AT NO MORE COST??  SO......WHAT'S THE "BEEF"???
I AM NOT DISUADED BY A COUPLE OF NEGATIVE REVIEWS... AND AM GOING TO ORDER SOME MORE OF THE TOP SIRLOIN... AND MAYBE TRY SOME OF THE FILET MIGNONS.  IF THE QUALITY IS NOT WHAT WE EXPECT CAN'T I USE THE MONEY BACK GUARANTEE?? DID THE NEGATIVE REVIEW PEOPLE TRY GETTING THEIR MONEY BACK OR SATISFACTION... THE PRODUCT SAYS IT WILL SATISFY OR GIVE YOUR MONEY BACK?

Flake - a rippled layer of chocolate. In the adverts, you need to eat it in the bath in order to avoid dropping chocolate crumbs. Buy them and put them in the fridge. Eat your flake while balanced over a plate to catch the crumbs. Divine. So much better than typical US chocolate. Yum

I have been using a Chemex 10-cup coffee maker for almost a year and have never had such good coffee before in my life. I am constantly looking forward to my next pot of coffee!

There is a downside to this coffee maker: it is a more manual procedure than what you are used to, and it also takes a couple of pots to learn how to use this most efficiently. The first time I tried to use mine, I had ground my coffee way too finely and it just took forever! The big time consumers: you have to boil your water separately (you do have a water kettle right?) and then you have to gradually pour the boiled water through the Chemex. This means that while the coffee is brewing, you are pouring, or watching, or giving the filter area a bit of a stir.

Now the up side: you will never ever ever drink a better cup of coffee. I use filtered water, freshly ground home roasted beans, and this Chemex to produce the finest coffee I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. And this coffee is a pleasure! In fact, I've totally given up using cream and sugar because my coffee no longer has anything to hide.

Another up side: clean up means swishing the Chemex with warm water and tossing the water down the drain. You can also wash with a bottle brush but this is rarely necessary. A brief swish is really all it takes to get your Chemex looking factory new. Try that with your electric drip machine! Ha! That thing will NEVER look brand new!

Oh, here's a final upside: this Chemex brews the best coffee you'll ever drink, and it costs less than just about anything. You are probably already spending more money than this every month at Starbucks!

Go ahead and buy yourself one of these. If necessary, wake up 10 minutes earlier to make your coffee. Better yet, wake up 20 minutes earlier. And when your coffee is ready, instead of dumping it into a travel cup and bolting out the door, sit down and enjoy your first cup for the next 10 minutes. You deserve it

My husband and I recently went to Florida to see his mother in the hospital. She had suddenly become ill. As we waited for her prognosis, we went to several local grocery stores to try to locate Drake's Funny Bones which my husband considered a comfort food that his mother would always get for him when he would visit. We looked to no avail.  
Unfortunately his mother passed away the next day. We headed home to Arizona and the first thing I did was try to find out how to get some of these snack cakes. I knew that it would mean so much for him to have them, if anything out of remembrance of his mother.  
I located Gristedes through Amazon and was so excited. The package arrived today. Unfortunately I was at work when my fianc notified me, and I sat with him on the phone while he opened his surprise. Both of our eyes filled with tears and you could hear the cry in his voice when he realized what it was. He said it was the best gift that he had ever received.  
Thank you for allowing him to have a little extra tribute to his mom for Christmas time.

I love Funny Bones. First of all I'm a sucker for chocolate and peanut butter together. Add an incredible consistancy- shiny chocolate coating around chocolate cake with peanut butter cream filling- well, put these in the fridge a spell, take them out, and Voila! The perfect munchy snack attack. Enjoy

Well, it worked out great because they were bought for a friend who now resides in California but is originally from New York.

They arrived in a timely fashion and they were in good condition and enjoyed by all.

In fact I would order them again.

  This product is great! Tastes fresh and enhances many foods and I was quite surprised that the container it came in was kind of like a pepper mill.............you just twist cap back & forth like you would do with fresh pepper and the product comes out. This product has many uses but really comes in handy for those sweet & sour recipes. I added this along with some pineapple to my chicken and it was outstanding

First of all let me say that this is what Black Tea is suppose to TASTE like. As soon as I took a sip of this tea earlier today, I knew that this is one of Tazo's finest tea. I'm not going to say that I've tasted many Earl Grey teas, because the only other Earl Grey Tea I've tasted is Twinings. But this tea in my opinion added a twist that was needed for Earl Grey Tea. Don't get me wrong Earl Grey Tea is fine the way it is, but the scented citrus bergamot added by Tazo makes a difference. 

I would enjoy drinking the Tea straight up with some sugar, but I like to add a little bit of milk to the tea because I'm used to adding Milk to Black Teas.

I recommend this Tea to anyone that is willing to try something new or enjoy Earl Grey with the Tazo Twist

Earl Grey is supposedly the second most popular tea in the world. Traditionally Earl Grey is created from a blend of black teas, usually Chinese and Indian teas, sometimes with a smokey flavor, and scented with the citrus fruit bergamot.  Earl Grey tea has an interesting history.  Legend has it that the first tea scented with bergamot oil was presented to Lord Grey from a Chinese mandarin whose son was saved from drowning by one of Lord Grey's men.  Twinings and Jacksons of Piccadilly both claim to be the first to have commercially blended this tea.

Tazo shows considerable expertise in the blend of this top quality tea. The black teas utilized are as the box states "the worlds most sought after teas from the high-elevation gardens of Nuwara Eliya, Uva and Dimbula in Sri Lanka and Assam in northeast India." They provide the perfect complement to the strong bergamot essence in this blend. The fragrance is powerfully floral, in particular lavender, citrus, and the woodsy-malt scent of premium black tea. The flavor of this splendid potion is rich and perfumed. A tasty sensual delight!

Earl Grey is traditionally served black, sometimes with lemon.  I prefer it with cream.  On a warning note, if you keep this tea in the cupboard for too long it will get old--the taste becomes very thin and harsh.  Brew it from fresh teabags and you won't be disappointed

How come all the fun is for Chubby Bunnies like WHOLE milk? Don't skimmy girls have more fun? Then what about SKIM milk?

Why not 128 fluid ounces of Tuscan WHOLE milk, instead of SKIM milk? To get the full benefits of milk's yummy yummy eternal goodness, I'll let these experts tell you why.

I was a blubbery dude after downing countless gallons of Tuscan Whole Milk.  People were calling me "Shamu the Whale" and "Gluteus Maximus" after I gained about a hundred pounds.

Made me come up with a rhyme about what happened next:

Then a friend, Gristedes, 
told me about the skim.  
A hundred pounds lighter 
without goin out on a limb.

It's got style, 
it's got class.
It took a big weight 
off my stomach

As my class of middle school students and I enjoyed the comments for Tuscan Whole Milk, one thought kept popping into our heads -- why not skim?  Why heap such praise upon whole milk and neglect skim, whose delightfully low-fat content has made my morning ecstatic for years?  I believe Tuscan Skim Milk will allow me to live forever (though I haven't proved that one yet).  My students say it enables them to do difficult homework with ease.  So, at last, we can breathe a full sigh of relief that Amazon is providing the world with the joy of skim

From Italy's famed milk region, Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz and Tuscan 2% Low Fat Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz are guaranteed to satisfy. The birthplace of the Italian Renaissance is also the birthplace of the world's most delectable beverage, Tuscan Whole Milk. Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo and Dante Alighieritable were known to imbibe in Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz's sweeth frothy goodness. Some say that Milk was the inspiration for the Mona Lisa.

Now the milk growers of Tuscan have released Tuscan Skim Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz...a lighter taste with less creamy overtones. In my opinion, an improvement over their earlier release and is my libation of choice. Bon appetit

I had this stuff almost every day while living in Chile for 2 years. Let me tell you, there is almost no comparison with the non-fat milk we drink here in the states. This stuff is way better. Don't quote me on this, but I heard that Nido isn't 100% non-fat. That being the case, it doesn't keep as long as non-fat powdered milk. But I might be wrong. At any rate, it's worth it. If you really want to make it taste good just add a little bit of sugar to sweeten it up

I cannot speak about the food item because it is in my pantry and I have not tried it yet. I will speak however, on the customer service of ImportFood.com Thai Supermarket.
First off - this is the first time I have ever been asked to submit a review for something I purchased via Amazon - this tells me that ImportFood.com is interested in feedback from their customers in order to continue their process improvement. I applaud that and have happily complied.
Secondly - out of all the times I have ordered from Amazon - this was the fastest delivery I have ever had. I was so surprised to see the box - I didn't know what it was at first because I wasn't expecting the product for several weeks - not a couple of days. When I opened the box, I couldn't believe that it was the product I had JUST ordered. So I am a very happy customer to have found the exact item I was looking for, at a very reasonable price with even better rate on shipping (I was worried about the inc. in gas would drive up shipping to make it not worth it) and then to receive it so quickly. Thanks

This tea is awesome. I had it in a restaurant once and tore off the little label and came home trying to find it on the internet. After finding it on Amazon, I looked up all the benefits of green tea, and realized that original green tea is kind of disgusting. So I ordered the Jasmine Green Tea, and with a little sugar and lemon, I drink it every day. Excellent product. Can't live without it

I drink this brand of Jasmine Green Tea every single day at work. The lower level of caffeine eases me awake as opposed to giving me coffee-jitters. Green tea is extremely good for you and also happens to taste amazing! I recommend this to anyone. It also makes a great iced tea for a different twist

I found this syrup to be quite tasty, on apples, and other things, or even on a spoon. You can use it to drizzle on things, instead of honey or maple syrup. You can use it in making rice Krispisy. truely, golden syrup is wonderful

I used this years ago when I lived in Europe and tried it again recently when I found it on Amazon. It adds a wonderful molasses taste in recipes calling for corn syrup, like pecan bars and chocolate frosting. It's a hit with my friends. One likes oatmeal now with a spoonful of the syrup.

The greatest tasting syrup ever made. Excellent on toast, no other syrup can come close. Forty years ago I thought it was the greatest and it still is! I am having a hard time purchasing it in my province in Canada and it is worth the effort to order it on line. I wish they would expand their distribution

These little cakes are so good with coffee and a real treat especially when frozen.  They can be a little dry if eaten without a beverage, otherwise, but they are an all time favorite of mine since I was a little girl growing up in Brooklyn, NY.  This company also used to put out little cream filled cakes called Yankee Doodles, but I don't think they are around anymore.  I'm just glad Drake's was kind enough to keep one of them going and I'm glad I found a place where I could order them without bothering my sister in NY all the time.
They're worth the try.

This is like hot sauce concentrate.  You MUST dilute it to use it.  Do not try to eat this stuff straight or you will be miserable for hours, and then some.  Lets just say it burns both ways.  A teaspoon in an entire crock of chili will make the chili hot enough to be near inedible, and I like very hot and spicy foods.  Five or six drops is probably more than enough for an entire dish.  Tabasco isn't even comparable to this, because no amount of tabasco would make a dish that hot.  This is truly the hotest sauce I have ever had, I think it killed my tastebuds (slight sarcasm).

Wash your hands thoroughly after use as there will often be residue on the lid.  If you rub your eyes they will burn for a long time, and I would suggest flushing them with water for about 10 minutes if you have the unfortunate experience.

The first listed ingredient is habaneros

Hottest Sauce in the Universe: no brag, just fact. I find that a single drop of Dave's Ultimate Insanity is more than equivalent to TEN drops of Tabasco. Why not five stars? While this sauce gives new meaning to the term extreme heat, I find the taste of Tabasco more pleasant. Ultimate Insanity adds a hint of a smokey/burnt flavor, which I assume is due to the roasted peppers. Try it for yourself..this the most heat you can get without notifying the Fire Marshall

This is the stuff hallucinogens bow before. The warning states that it's not for anyone with poor heart conditions, high blood pressure, or contemplating pregnancy, ever. And it means it.

One drop of this sauce in anything will have your eyes watering and your stomach curdling. Why it's in a bottle this big I'll never know, but this stuff is the real deal. I was foolish enough to have three drops in a shot of vodka one fateful night many moons ago, and I still tremble at the memory.

I can't rate it high enough, so five stars will have to do

I love this popcorn.  I buy loads of it so I never run out.  I don't know why this isn't the most popular popcorn out there.  I don't think people know about it, or maybe they don't want to have to cook it.  But it's so easy and good

This is probably the BEST popcorn you can make at home, packaged with the Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper, and you have a great little gift set.

Sidenote:  It probably isn't the healthiest Popcorn for you (there is a lot of oil and butter flavoring), but it is the tastiest!!

I tired Real Theater Popcorn last night for the first time and managed to eat the entire thing by myself!!  It was that good.   If this isn't exactly like movie theater popcorn, it's as close as it gets!  I'm purchasing the 20 pack today and am going to hand out a few packs to my friends whom share the same love of popcorn that I do.   

It's GOOD!

I bought some of this for my husband last Christmas with a stovetop popcorn popper (the kind with the stir rod.)  Now it's our favorite brand of popcorn and our favorite way to make it.  The packages come with pre-measured oil & popping corn and you just cook it all up.  Each box has 5 bags.  Each bag makes a big bowl (?20 cups?)  We only have to add salt and we love the taste.  I highly recommend this with a stir rod popper, too--either the stovetop or electric kind.

i LOVE Lindt Lindor chocolate truffles. i fell in love with the milk chocolate and since i am such a big white chocolate fan as well, i had to try this one. its divine - i will give it that - but it tasted more like vanilla frosting than white chocolate. it felt like i was eating some sort of vanilla cake frosting out of a can than white chocolate, so i was dissapointed that aspect. but it really is a great item, despite that

Great product for chocolate lovers and social lovers alike. More of an end-of-the-night activity... unless you're just having a dessert party of course! My one complaint is the impractical (although oh-so-whimsical) tissue packaging. It is hazardously absorbent. Even the assertive flavors of these high-quality chocolates are not enough to ward of infringing odors from nearby pantry items. Note: do not store next to your curry sampler...
Best of luck chocoholics,

I saw this at Whole Foods and bought it from there.  I wanted something nice to bring to a house party and didn't feel like bringing flowers.  It was a hit!  It really is very pretty and memorable.  It was one of a kind, plus a small piece made a nice dessert with coffee.  Well worth the price.  It would be fun for a chocolate tasting event.

Don't go for generic gooey dollar store imitations. This is what gummy bears are supposed to be.

It's great to have the option to enjoy Drake's even on Weight Watchers.  Each package is only 4 Weight Watcher points and they still taste like Drake's!

Yum

This was the best experience. I had mixed feelings about ordering food products and from a new company with Amazon but it was wonderful. The leaves are just great and taste great too. They were very appologetic because of weather it shipped out a couple of days late BUT I still got them ontime. I can not wait to use all of the leaves to order (as well as more ingredients) from them.

Divinely Delicious Chocolates - Truly the best in the world!

If it is possible to fall madly in love with a box of chocolates, then the assortment is the perfect place to start such an adventure. These chocolate are named after Leonidas Kestekidis, who definitely knew how to create chocolates for the true chocolate connoisseur. 

When he moved back to Belgium he not only married his true love, he created chocolates the world now adores. When you taste these chocolates, your taste buds will also finally know true chocolate happiness. Whether you try one of these with a cup of coffee or tea or enjoy one as a daily indulgence, these will impress. 

The "I Love You" chocolate with dreamy lemon filling embodies this sentiment. Each chocolate has a unique design and the I Love You chocolate has two hearts, ribbons and a seal. After you sample the variety of chocolates, specific flavors will stand out as favorites. 

Here are my favorite creamy fillings (ganache and butter cream) which come in dark, white and milk chocolate depending on the selection: 

Antoinette - A smooth Brandy flavored ganache 

Lingoit Lait - Absolutely delicious vanilla flavored fresh butter cream filling. Time definitely stopped while tasting this chocolate. 

Irrsistible - Dark chocolate and Strawberry sauce. 

For ever - If you love coffee this may be one of the most delicious milk or dark chocolate chocolates ever made as it is filled with a special coffee cream that has hints of caramel. I ordered an entire box of these and they come in a variety of flavors. The milk chocolate and cherry filling is like Claude Debussy's Rverie. It is difficult to describe besides saying it is like a delicate cherry icing wrapped in milk chocolate. 

Merveilleux - Milk or dark chocolate filled with coffee ganache. 

Europe - Dark or milk chocolate filled with rum filling. 

Ganache - Milk or dark chocolate with pure ganache. 

Tosca - Milk chocolate with a special ganache. 

Posie - Dark chocolate and a Cointreau filling. 

Antoinette - Delicate caramel hints in the milk chocolate coating mingle nicely with the vanilla filling. 

Eve - Milk or dark chocolate with a creamy dreamy banana filling. 

Alexandre le grand - A milk or dark chocolate with caramel cream. 

Also Recommended: 

If you wish to also try the Napolitains, I'd suggest the 1 pound sampler Ballotin with six varieties. You may also want to look for the new Palet d'Or. A deeply delicious and strong bitter chocolate filled with ganache. The center is made with butter, cream and chocolate and the outer coating is a masterpiece with gold decorations. 

Leonidas now has over 1700 stores and sales locations worldwide and they offer over 80 varieties of fresh chocolates. The chocolates are air freighted weekly from Brussels so you will always find the quality to be superior. 

My chocolates arrived fast and were as fresh as if I had purchased them in Belgium. They were carefully packaged in the famous gold boxes with signature/seasonal wrapping and a ribbon. The boxes were then placed in protective Styrofoam containers to protect the chocolates during shipping. The expedited shipping is recommended from May to early September.

This is a good selection of ingredients to start making sushi. It has everything you need except fillings, but there are no instructions. I recommend getting a simple book like Sushi Made Easy to give you the basics. I was pleased with the quality of the ingredients. I might buy this again if I find myself out of everything at once.

So here's the deal, I'm from Omaha, you can't go two miles without an Omaha Steaks Store.  Here we just call em steaks.  I can go to any butcher shop in Omaha and buy steaks that are just as good if not better than anything Omaha Steaks has to offer for considerably less.  This has always been my stance.  That is until I had these, these are quite simply the best steaks.  Yes, they're expensive, but if you're like my family and go out for steaks on birthday's you can actually save quite a bit by buying these instead.  You won't get a better steak in a restaurant, and my uncle's the head chef in a steak house, I could be stabbed just for saying that.  Cooked rare to medium rare you can literally cut them with your fork, they are more tender and have twice the flavor of any filet I've ever had.  I can't stress to you how good these are.  It's still the only steak I buy from Omaha Steaks, but when you come from the land of steaks that's saying a lot.  Sorry Texas, you may have more cows, but Nebraska Beef is simply better

In my case it was for my dad's birthday a couple days ago, and it went great. I placed my order a week before the event (I know, probably could have been too late), but it arrived 3 days later, packaged really well in dry ice. If you're looking for a gift for a male relative, you will never go wrong with getting him some Omaha Steaks

Item as expected, services average; shipping cost wasn't as ecconomical as I would have liked to have seen but, obviously, I paid it.  I probably could have found the tea in a store but am hard pressed to get anywhere, so...  All-in-all, everything went as expected

I've bought all sizes, shapes and scents, and this is my hands-down favorite candle. The aroma is crisp and clean without being soapy, fragrant without being overpoweringly floral. It's just refreshing and calming, and strong enough to clear cooking smells from a kitchen. My only complaint is that it only comes in green, which doesn't match my house..

I'm on a low carb diet and didn't like just eating a bowl of plain tuna with mayo... yuck!  I add a cup of Dreamfield's elbows to give me a better lunch for only 5 net carbs and now I actually look forward to having tuna.  Also, for 7 carbs you can add shredded cheese, a drop of milk, a pat of butter and pinch of salt to indulge yourself in a creamy macaroni with cheese dish!  Yummy :o

I have used this pasta for two years.  It has an excellent taste and consistency while being low carb.  Much better than whole wheat choices.  I've tried all the selections and all I can say is I'm looking forward to the company adding rigatoni and acini de pepe sometime in the future.  It's hard to find in restaurants but if you are ever in Pittsburgh, they serve it at Gullifty's-wonderful.  Some diabetics may find it doesn't work for them--trial and error if you eat it because of diabetes.

Dean & Deluca's Basil can add delicious aromas to your crockpot cooking adventures. It is also perfect to add to a pot of steaming vegetables or to sprinkle on fish wrapped in puff pastry. The minute you open a tin of the Dean & Deluca Basil, you can sense the high-quality of the product and the aroma swirls into the air making you eager to try many of their herb and spice products. 

I especially love using this when making a homemade stock in my crockpot/slow cooker. It enhances soups, vegetables and just about anything you sprinkle it on that is savory. This can also be used in salad dressings and is especially delicious used over pasta, if you ever run out of fresh basil in the winter.

I have to admit I had little hope for the little sample of ground coffee that I received from Amazon as part of a free promotional package to promote their new non-perishable grocery line. However, against all odds, I find Millstone's product to be among the smoothest tasting coffees I've had from a package. Understand that I am mainly part of the mobile Starbucks-and-Peets crowd that's used to the aftertaste of the wooden stirrer and the slightly curdled milk when I swallow my caffeine. Normally I prefer grinding my own beans at home, but given my predilection for my infrequently used French Press maker, I occasionally enjoy a heaping brew of the roasted Colombian Supremo. Each of the sixteen packets is 1.75 ounces, enough easily for about six cups. I say give it a try as a relatively convenient alternative to your normal coffee run

*****
Tazo's China Green Tips Green Tea is a slightly stronger green tea than Tazo's Zen, and I liked that it doesn't contain Tazo's omnipresent "natural flavors" that almost all of their other teas contain, which to me is not an advantage. I like a natural, real taste with real ingredients sans vague "natural flavors" and sans flavorings, sans essences, etc. China Green Tips delivers this in a cleaner, purer way than Tazo's other teas. I liked this green tea!

The ingredients in China Green Tips are simply spring-harvested green teas from China. It contains caffeine.

Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague and unnecessary for a super premium tea. China Green Tips has none of these "natural flavors" and it shows in the quality and cleanliness of the tea experience.

On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a traditional Chinese green tea with a delicate fresh taste and a light green liquor." This is the perfect way to describe this tea! On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of China Green Tips as "grassy, vegetative, sweet, ricey". Tazo describes the aroma as "vegetative, popcorn". 

I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as very good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi or Aspen. Still, this tea is excellent, so I'm breaking my tradition with Tazo teas and giving it five stars. If you enjoy super premium teas, and are stuck with Tazo for some reason, choose China Green Tips and you will be quite satisfied. I can't honestly say that about any other Tazo tea.

This is a classic green tea that brews up to a pale amber liquor with a fine grassy scent. Savor this tea for a delicate and elusive experience. The taste is barley, sweet hay and the faintest herbal taste. The aftertaste is very mild and fresh.

Green tea is touted for its health benefits--not just antioxidants but also because it is supposed to help you lose weight!! Green tea averages about 10-30 mg of caffeine as opposed to 90 mg in a cup of coffee. Tazo does not put how much caffeine is in their tea on the box

You can get better tea if you're willing to deal with leaves, but that's not practical for most of us, especially for those who drink it at work like I do. Compare this to a budget-brand bagged green tea (like Salada, which I used to drink), and you'll be able to tell the difference right away. The Tazo isn't overbearingly flavorful (no green tea is), but its subtle "green" taste is addictive (as is the caffeine!)

Since my husband perfected his technique of grilling Omaha Steak Filet Mignon, we no longer order steak when we go out to dinner.  Even at the most expensive, fanciest restaurants, their steak just isn't as good as what my husband does on the grill with these Omaha Steaks.

Hands down, the best steaks I have ever had.  I scoff at people who would refer to them as dry: they simply don't know how to cook steak.  We have been buying Omaha Steaks products for 4 years.  No, I am not a butcher, but I do enjoy a good steak.

In terms of value: $6-$8 for a steak would scare me if I saw it on a menu at a restaurant -- these steaks ARE value.  There are no supermarkets in my area that can compete with these cuts of beef. 

These days there are not a lot of products or companies out there who deliver consistent quality, but Omaha Steaks is one company who continues to impress me.

Grapes: Mother Nature's candy. 

I first became acquainted with grapes back in the summer of '84 when the wind came whistling over the planes. Old Mumsie and I often held hands as we frolicked down half frozen fjords to stumble across wild grapes in our tree forest home. It is on this note that I came to purchase these magical and tasty items, and I can safely say I was not disappointed.

Within three seconds of consuming these products, my legs grew back and my chest hair took on a vitalise sheen.

Despite being a member of the Solanaceae or often-deadly nightshade family (native to the Americas), I find tomatoes to be relatively friendly to my innards.  While I feel that masquerading as a vegetable is a bit deceptive (they are technically a berry), I am quite a fan of the tomato, and find the notion that they were originally known as "Love Apples" to be rather quaint and charming - not to mention tender, juicy, and delicious.

So tender and delicious.

This food calls back to my youth.  I'm still always impressed that these things can stay as moist as they do.  This is a major plus.  I'm really not so keen on the whole frosting thing and this one still finds me wanting with the urge to be sick just thinking about eating the filling.  But more power to them for having the retro cool thing going on and the ability to foist them off on adult aquaintences in need of a snack

Delicious Hostess Chocolate Cupcakes were the first Hostess Cupcakes.  You can now get orange flavored Hostess Cupcakes as well.  While homemade cupcakes are still the best, if you have too little time to whip up a batch of cupcakes, when these cupcakes are fresh they are hard to beat.  They have a soft, chocolate cake body with a creamy middle and chocolate icing on top.  The only problem with these cupcakes is that they are addictive, and those of us who spend too little time on the treadmill need to watch home many of these things that we eat, both at one time and altogether.

Well, I hear a Hostess Cupcake calling my name..

****
Tazo's Lotus Decaffeinated Green Tea is one of my favorite Tazo teas. The lotus flower flavor is pleasant and delightful. This tea is not bitter or harsh in any way. It is one of the most natural-tasting of the Tazo's I've tasted, very subtle, and much less artificial-tasting.

The ingredients in Lotus are: naturally decaffeinated green tea, natural lotus flower flavor and other natural flavors. Of course, this tea is caffeine-free.

Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.

On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "delightfully subtle green tea with the inner radiance and essence of lotus flower." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Lotus as "peach, nutty, flowery, overripe melon. This surprisingly full-flavored yet delicately floral blend is clean and light-bodied, with an aroma reminiscent of freesia." Tazo also describes the aroma as "tropical fruit, green tea". Hmmm...I don't taste all of these various flavors, and I suspect that Tazo really pushes the creative writing limit. I taste green tea, and a nice flowery flavor, which I'm assuming is the lotus, but not the rest---the peach, nuts, melon, freesia, tropical fruit---they're missing from what I can discern here.

I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Lotus gets only four stars.

This is the story of two Tazo teas. I found that they almost need one another to produce a tea of exceptional quality. I tried each tea separately and finally blended them together. 

Tazo Lotus and Tazo Wild Sweet Orange make a wonderful lemony hot tea in the winter or enjoy being tossed about with ice cubes in the summer. The way I make this tea is by steeping two Lotus and two Wild Sweet Orange filterbags with 16 ounces of water. I make this in my coffee maker so there is plenty of time for the flavors to seep out into the steaming water. Then, you can add 2 tablespoons of orange blossom honey for hot tea and a bit more for ice tea. 

Drinking this blend is an aromatic experience. Lotus Decaffeinated Green tea is a blend of naturally decaffeinated green tea, natural lotus flower flavor and other natural flavors. Wild Sweet Orange is a blend of lemongrass, blackberry leaves, citric acid, rose hips, spearmint leaves, natural flavors, orange peel, safflowers, hibiscus flowers, rose petals, natural orange essence, ginger root and licorice root. 

I love the crinkly sound of the paper bags protecting the precious contents. The boxes are also quite intriguing and the stories on the tea packets are always mysterious and playful. 

A romantic tea with a golden-orange color. I can never decide if I like this best hot or cold, so I end up drinking it hot and cold. Half on ice and half in a mug. When this tea is hot, it is much more romantic and aromatic. When chilled it takes on a more bitter component. 

For something even more exotic, try the Tazo Green Ginger tea.

I found it to be a bit gamey. And that's after 6 hours in a slow-cooker. It looks a bit tough and leathery in the photo, and it really is. Plus I think mine had one or two shotgun buck pellets still in it. Does anyone know if there is a Le Village in Greenwich? Maybe it is fresher to pick it up in-store..

WOW!! This is awesome.  You guys have everything!!! I ordered 20 for valentines day.  They serve as the lining of the valentines day baskets that I am donating to my local church.  After they dig into the delicious assortment of candies and fruit they can rejoice that they will find a fine fresh rabbit for stewing later that evening.  Now if I only had some taters...

How can you not love the Twinkie?  It's compact, delicious, and aerodynamic.  If you actually look at the ingredients, Twinkies are made of flour, water, shortening, eggs, sugar... sound familiar?  It's cake.  There are some preservatives added to increase shelf life, but they make up a very small percentage of the overall treat.  The air we breathe probably contains more dangerous 'additives' than a twinkie.  Let us face facts; if one were to eat slice after slice of chocolate cake baked using organic ingredients, that person is going to end up in coronary bypass land just as quickly as if one gorged on Twinkies.  Twinkies, like anything, in moderation are just fine

Why are you listed as a gourmet food?  Amazon seems to have misfiled you as you'd be more appropiately listed under joint compound.  As a child, I loved you but as an adult I loathe you.  The lard filling sickens me.  But I'll rate you a three just because of the cool factor of being listed on Amazon

Green bell peppers are very versatile; great for stuffed peppers, salads or sauteeing with Italian sausage.  I'm a big fan of all peppers, and would give most all peppers a high rating...I had to bump the bell pepper down a star for its low rating on the Scoville scale.  Bell peppers rate a 0 on this scale of hotness. Just a little bit of spiciness would make these peppers a definite 5-star vegetable, due to its versatility and delicious capsaicin taste...but alas, the bell pepper is void of that magical capsaicin, and thus a 4-star vegetable

These pods work well with my Simplehuman coffee maker.  And I can get both an 8 oz. cup and an additional 5 ozs out of each pod.  Taste of the mocha cinnamon swirl is balanced and not too sweet.  But do some comparison shopping - if you buy directly from the Java Podz website, the cost of both the pods and the s/h are lower than buying through Amazon

These burgers are unbelievable. They are really fresh and juicy burgers with a distinctive meaty taste you will fall in love with if you love a great burger.  They are Omaha Steaks best product and the only thing I order from them. I actually love the packaging. Each burger comes individually wrapped in vacuum sealed plastic, which means I can keep them in the freezer until I am ready to eat them. Then defrost them in warm water and in 10 minutes I have fresh red meat, they have a nice peppery Angus beef smell, and they taste great. They never go to waste.  I find the meat I buy in the stores these days can't compare at all. Them smell of the meat doesn't smell fresh - more like plastic than meat. Ok, the Styrofoam cooler is a waste of packaging, and not environmentally friendly but they can be reused several times.

Amazon also has a great price on these. After a quick search around the web, this looks to be the best price

I bought seven beans for seven dollars, and was a bit unimpressed with the aromatic quality. They didn't have that strong complex aroma right out of the bag that bourbon beans are known for. That is not to say that the inside of the bean isn't aromatic. After all, it's the guts that really count. Even though these beans don't seem to be as aromatic as other beans, this is still a KILLER DEAL!!! I recently purchased one bean from a popular brand "Spice Islands" for seven dollars. An unbelievably aromatic bean, but seven times the cost of these beans!?!?!? I think I'll just buy these and use twice as many as the higher quality beans. I'm still making away like a bandit

First off, top notch customer service- there's a personal touch that's rarely seen in on-line purchasing!  Please keep it up!

Now for the goods: These vanilla beans are a fantastic value.  Seriously, I wasn't expecting much- I was hopeful given the other reviews- but I've learned some hard lessons to not expect such high standards of quality- especially when it comes to gourmand items-  These beans are even superior to those I can get from my local provider (at three times the cost, mind you.)  I've even ordered online from two other sources (one recommended by Martha Stewart, lol)- and these beans are plumper and more supple than those other pricier providers.  (Plump and supple- always a good thing.)

If you're on the fence- I urge you to go for it.  You owe it to your recipes to use quality indredients.  You will not be disappointed.  I know I'm not.

Thank you kindly

I bought these and the greatest thing besides the awesome price and the fabulous beans is that the VP or CEO or some such lovely gentleman actually emailed me and thanked me for my purchase and when I responded, followed up again with a nice response! How nice is that in this day and age! 

I used these beans in my home made eggnog this year and it was out of this world. I first scraped the bean and then threw the pod in and left it there till the nog was gone. (not long)

I also use one when I make my hot chocolate "syrup" (Lots of bittersweet chips, melted in milk and a little haff and half and the bean scraped and the pod - once again left in - I mske hot chocolate out of it by adding more milk to taste and a little bitty bit of brandy...decadent...oh my yes!)

This is a great buy, great beans, great company! Buy with assurance!

Since I discovered this wonderful relish in England a few years ago I have tried to buy replacements in this country. It is served at most pubs in the UK as part of a Ploughman's Lunch along with various cheeses and other goodies. It has a wonderful taste and texture, unlike anything in this country. I recommend every one buy some. I've found it only on Amazon

This is the best sandwich topping ever!  I grew up eating Branston Pickle on my cheddar cheese and ham sandwiches, so it holds lots of good memories for me.  It has a deliciously sweet and tangy taste - some say (e.g., my wife) it is an acquired one - and nice crunchiness from the pickled vegetables.  I cannot say enough good things about it

"A single cup of Tazo Calm has been known to have the same effect as sitting for 45 minutes in a mountain meadow on a sunny day with your shoes off." ~tea packet 

Drinking this particular tea blend almost begs for 32 ounces of water. You can brew this tea in your coffee maker by letting the water drip slowly onto the tea that is sitting in a coffee filter or you can use the infuser that comes with this kit. 

This tea has a magical, almost golden sparkle of brass. The ingredients in this herbal blend are almost romantic. How often do you drink a tea with "rose petals" in the blend? 

Ingredients: Chamomile flowers, hibiscus flowers, spearmint, lemongrass, rose petals, blackberry leaves, safflowers, peppermint, sarsaparilla, lemon balm, licorice, and other natural flavors. 

Chamomile is known for its soothing properties and after drinking this tea I have vivid dreams and my sleep is deep and calm and I wake up refreshed. Tazo Calm Herbal Infusion will allow your body to relax into sleep and can be especially calming after yoga, before bed, or when writing peaceful thoughts in your journal.

Oh how I love the Cucumis melo reticulatus!  It's much sweeter and tastier than the Cucumis melo cantalupensis (the European cantaloupe).  You see, the CMR is the American version, this very same cantaloupe that's produced in California.  This should be called the Freedom Musk-Melon...true patriots eat the CMR!  If you're some sort of brie eating French lover, then go for the CMC....you America-hating hippy

After slicing through the outer rine of this pleasently heavy fruit an irresitable wealth of naturally sweet goodness is revieled.  This swollen ovary is undoubtably the greatest variety of Cantaloupe in existance.  There is no comparison to Cantaloupes grown in other areas.  The California Jumbo Cantaloupe makes any other variety look like "Achondroplastic Cantaloupe."  This copious  orb of delictableness is a must have for any herbivore or omnivore

I have been faithfully buying Omaha Steaks products for years.  In MY grocer's freezer and MY butcher, there is nothing the compares to the taste and quality of these burgers.  You get what you pay for -- this company delivers consistent quality again and again.  

I think other reviewers of Omaha Steaks product don't know how to use their grill. If you follow the step-by-step instructions: PRESTO -- perfect taste every time

One day, while my cell phone wasn't working (as usual) I decided to see what would happen if I wrapped the antennae in a bunch of Dole USA # 1 Iceberg Lettuce, 1 ct!

Of course, you would never believe me in a trillion zillion years, but it worked better!

Now I go to high level executive functions with a Dole USA # 1 Iceberg Lettuce, 1 ct attached to my ear, and people thing I'm strange... but the heck with them.

Now I have better coverage than they do! And isn't that what it's all about?

Silver Needle White Tea is the finest tea I have ever tasted.  The flavor is delicate without being weak and there is no bitter aftertaste as with the majority of teas.  Because there is less caffiene, I did not experience the jittery, nauseous feeling I get from other teas.

How refreshing it is to know that we can turn to Amazon for all our fresh elk carcass needs!  No more hoping to come across a large road kill on the way home from work!  Perfect for wedding receptions, birthday parties and anniversary celebrations - you know, all those fun times when you just have to dig that pit in the back yard, and roast a large slab of meat.  Slice up those leftovers, and you'll have sandwiches for weeks.  Thank you Amazon

This tea is just like you will find at the Thai restaurant. I find it best to brew in the coffee maker, making it very strong and adding water to it later. I use about one cup of loose tea to 8 cups of water in the coffe machine. When it's all brewed and hot, I add the sugar, more water and keep it in the fridge. I add evaporated milk as needed, per each glass. It's a wonderful drink for a summer day

I got this set for my husband for part of his Christmas present and he loved it.  He didn't know that Dave's Insanity wasn't the hottest he could get until now - he immediately opened the Ultimate and started "practicing" eating it on crackers until it wouldn't make him sweat so he could embarrass his brother by making him sick with it when we went home for the holidays.  Next year I'm getting the bloody mary mix as a stocking stuffer, and maybe the nuts too

Lindt Lindor truffles are very smooth, quite rich, and very sweet.  They tend to melt in your mouth (and in your hands, so get shoveling).  For me, they're a bit too sweet, as I prefer the taste of Leonidas or Cote d'Or chocolates, as they have a bit more bite to them.  They are also much harder to find and more expensive.  Soooooo, if you want good, rich chocolate, and you like your chocolate sweet, Lindt Lindor truffles is a good place to look

These are THE BEST truffles I have ever, ever tasted! They come in milk chocolate, dark chocolate and white confection - the chocolate lovers dream!!!  There are 18 pieces per package - control yourself though, the serving size is only 7 pieces!! The creamy filling is heavenly!!  My absolute favorite is the White Confection...my mouth waters just thinking about it!!!
If you love chocolate - you need to find a package of these - you'll be in paradise with every bite!

I ordered this for my husband's Christmas present on December 21st.  I really didn't think it would arrive in time and had printed a picture to give him until it arrived.  It arrived on the 23rd!!!! It was well packaged and was delivered intact. He is absolutely delighted with it.  He has a hot sauce collection and this is definately the piece de resistance! Thank yo

This is definitely the best hot sauce ever. An exceptionally hot sauce but comes with a great flavor and after taste. Not to be used by itself, but as an additive in very small doses. I bought my bottle in 1998 and am only half way through it. Love it

I have spent many years walking the Earth, much like Kane, and I've seen many things. Some of them legal, some of them warranting several eternities in Hades. But I have never before bared witness to purple potatoes. Seeing as that I am such an adventurous chap, I decided to give them a whirl. If nothing else, I told myself, they would make delightful earrings for my wife, Maude. She's something of a tuber afficianado, don't ya know. Upon their arrival at my abode, I happened to notice that the delivery lad was wearing a bio-hazard suit and that the potatoes were being transported within a lead container. Thinking nothing of it, I opened the container and proceeded to eat them raw. Imagine the surprise and delight when I felt my very DNA being torn apart and restructured. I now write to you all from the cave I share with the cyclops, seeing as how I am now 37 feet tall, have a spiked tail, horns, and nictitating membranes over my eyes. Did I mention I am a lovely shade of violet now and breath fire? All thanks to the delicious pommes de terre

****
Tazo's Decaffeinated Chai Black Tea is an enjoyable chai experience for the most part. On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a rich blend of full-flavored naturally decaffeinated teas and exotic aromatic spices." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Decaffeinated Chai as "creamy, vanilla, sweet and pungent spices". Tazo describes the aroma as "sweet spice". Those are pretty accurate. The black tea "blend" is a little bitter, though, even with minimal brewing. It's a real trick to get it to brew long enough to get to experience the flavor from the spices without having the tea turn bitter.


The ingredients in Decaffeinated Chai are: naturally decaffeinated black teas, rooibos, cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, chicory, cloves, black pepper, natural flavors, and star anise. It is caffeine-free!

Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.

I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Decaffeinated Chai gets only four stars.

People always tell me, "malfouka, those sardines aren't any good.  You should try "brand X."  Well, they're wrong.  King Oscar knows sardines and until you try them (I recommend serving them on buttered toast with a small squeeze of Miracle Whip), you don't know what you're missing!

SImply amazing -- one of the best low carb products around....forget Atkins bake mix....this is low carb Bisquick.  Now, it is not AS good as Bisquick....but it is good!  Makes good biscuits, a killer pie crust, and yummy "drop danish" ( not really a danish consistancy, tastes like very sweet pie crust )....plus can use with spices as a breading for chicken, fish, veggies, cheese.....BUY IT!!

Clark's Teaberry Gum became the rage in the 1960s when Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass played "The Teaberry Shuffle." Originally produced by the D L Clark Company, who got their fame with the Clark Bar, the gum is a Pittsburgh favorite for over 100 years. The mild flavor is somewhere between wintermint and a very faint touch of cinnamon, that somehow gives it a bit of a tea taste. It is a very sublte flavore, which is to me much more refreshing than the extra-strong gums from the other guys. There is also a sugar-free variet

D. L. Clark Company was founded in 1886, in Pittsburg Pennsylvania. The company was best known for its chocolate Clark Bar, which was sent over bulk to America's W.W.1 soldiers, who formed a lifelong attachment to it. Since its founding, the company has changed hands many times.

Teaberry gum has a flavor that is hard to describe, as it really doesn't taste like anything else. It is smooth and sweet, with a taste you will never forget. When I was young, a local drug store carried a wide range of candies, including Teaberry gum. Whenever I could I would go and buy a pack, and to this day the Teaberry taste takes me back to my youth and that drug store with the giant racks of candy.

So, if you want a great gum that tastes like no other gum out there, then buy Teaberry gum. It's fantastic!

Sometimes I feel like I've been on a diet forever. Of course, I haven't been -- I've been on and off one or another, then back again. 

I don't believe any tea is a wonder cure for everything, but I find tea helpful in managing my appetite, my stress levels, and outlook on life. I drink this Oolong tea, really enjoy it, and suspect it helps me feel less hungry in the midafternoon. 

I've heard it's rich in anti-oxidants, and promotes the burning of fat. It may well be. I've lost bodyfat and weight -- but, again, I believe the result are due to a combination of factors that includes regular exercise, counting calories, and taking time to for a deep breath and a warm cuppa

I love this tea. The filterbag smelled unbelievable, and the beverage itself brewed up into this gorgeous dark pink color. I wish I'd used my clear glass mug.

I added a little sugar because I can't drink anything without a little sweetener, but your average person probably would do fine with it. 

This stuff is terrific, I definitely recommend it

****
Tazo's Passion Herbal Infusion is a somewhat tart, deep, flavorful (hibiscus-y tasting) tea. It is not berry-like in taste, although it is red in color. It's difficult to describe what hibiscus tastes like, but I find it a most pleasant taste. My husband says it tastes like pomegranate to him. Although Passion contains licorice root it is not sweet. 

The ingredients in Passion are: hibiscus flowers, natural tropical flavors, citric acid, orange peel, licorice root, cinnamon bark, rose hips, lemongrass and red poppy. It is caffeine-free!

Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.

On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "A tantalizing deep red tea made from hibiscus flowers, exotic herbs and natural tropical flavors." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Passion as "berry, juicy, wine-like, merlot, sweet, earthy, dense". Tazo describes the aroma as "sweet, juicy, red fruits". 

I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as very good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Passion gets only four stars.

I have tried many teas in my life , &amp; this by far has gone over the top with me ... I have tried 4 different flavors , all of which were very satisfying. The one I liked best is Tazo Chai , it has a spice flavor that just captivates the taste buds . It may not be for every one , but since I like the taste &amp; smell of exotic spices , this does very well for me . I will buy it &amp; keep it on hand as much as possible.

Blend a little apple cider mix into your Tazo Passion Tea and see what happens. This creates a magical apple cider experience with hints of cranberry and hibiscus flowers gathered in an ancient land. 

Snuggle Up Spiced Cider is a good choice because you can then spoon in the exact amount you desire, but packets of cider work equally well. This is the type of tea you would expect to enjoy after skiing in some distant forest where you are also munching on homemade brownies or eggnog cookies. Apple cider also works very well with the Gypsy Teas, especially the Lemon Jasmine. 

The deep purple/red color and hibiscus fragrance of Tazo Tea is enough to make anyone passionate about tea. Yet, is this really tea? It looks like tea, but it is really an herbal infusion made by steeping hibiscus flowers, orange peel, licorice, cinnamon, rose hips, lemongrass and red poppy in a swirling of hot water.

The original flavor is also slightly reminiscent of hot apple cider or hot cranberry juice which is why it is extra delicious with a cider mix. Tazo Teas are a mysterious experience into which you can lose yourself with a sense of abandon. So far I've tried more flavors than I can count and have always been impressed.

I was surprised by some unexpected guests for dinner.  I had not opened the jar before, so I wasn't sure how to use it.  I decided to pour it over boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cover the dish with tin foil and bake.  It was a hit!!  Even my husband liked it, and he is very picky and stuck on old favorites.  I just bought a couple more jars.

I bought some of this after seeing it featured on Food Finds.  At first I thought it would be a good alternative to cranberry sauce at Thanksgiving but it's even better than that.  It's not tart like regular cranberry.....even with all the different tart fruits in the ingredients, it's surprisingly smooth and surprisingly good.  I've tried it on ice cream, with cheese and crackers and have even put it on barbequed pork.  So far, it's been fabulous on everything.  I just keep trying to find more things to try it on!  Will definitely be buying this one again

Our son has a gluten allergy and we have tried everything on the market to replace flour.  None of the mixes tasted hardly edible until we tried Pamela's.  We would use this even if we didn't have to go gluten free.  It is excellent for EVERYTHING from pancakes, waffles, breads, breading, brownies...you get the idea

I received a very well packaged (and promptly shipped even) package of the Habanero Jerky from Mahogany Smoked Meats.
 
 The jerky itself it obviously made from good meat (vs some of the garbage you'd get from Oberto or whomever). The initial smell is excellent. An aroma of pepper and brown sugar.
 
 However, the Jerky itself is somewhat sticky. The pieces of the jerky itself are stuck together, so extracting a single piece for consumption becomes a chore. After you're done, your hands are all sticky. My guess is if they manufacturer spent a little longer in a dessicator, we'd have a drier product that tasted just as well.
 
 As for how spicy. Well, my lips are burning. I like that. I really love Habanero (and in fact grow several varieties at home). This isn't some &quot;slightly spicy&quot; product with the name Habanero in it to make it seem macho. It will scorch your mouth. In my opinion, scorch in a good way.
 
 The price is great. You'd spend that much at any store, buying a far lower quality of jerky, and just try finding habanero ANYTHING at Safeway.
 
 Kudos to Amazon for removing yet one more thing from my shopping list. Additional kudos to Mahogany Smoked Meats for having such a wonderful product.
 
 I've taken one star off for the jerky being so sticky (I guess it's the sugar?), and the difficulty of separating out the pieces of jerky themselves.
 
 Definitely recommended

A friend went on a trip to Costa Rica and brought this coffee back with her.  I loved it from the first cup.  I've been a Starbucks fan for a long time, but this coffee is way better than Starbucks.  I just received my first order from Cafe Britt.  It arrived very promptly and in great condition.  If you love coffee, I'd highly recommend giving this coffee a try

I'm only a little bit of a coffee nut, but I really like this coffee. My fiance's father brought some back from Costa Rica while he was there on business. I have just finished my bag and already miss it. This was one of the best coffees I have tasted. Well balanced, not too acidic, not too bitter, just right in my opinion. It's really good served traditionally hot, but it's also great iced. And as with all coffees... it's best if you get whole bean and grind it yourself.

My opinion... a must try

If you are only starting your trek into the world of serious coffee appreciation, then I highly suggest you, without haste, purchase one pound at least of whole bean JBM. Also a good grinder, a temperature controlled machine and a decent water filtration system. Pre-ground takes much of the flavor away, compaired to properly done fresh home ground coffee, and coffee is lessened without being prepaired at the correct temperature of filtered water.

But why something so expensive? Why jump in to the deep end of the pool before even getting your feet wet? 

Some may scoff, saying that only a true coffee fanatic would understand or be able to appreciate this blend. That is entirely true. But how can anyone really understand without first having tasted the standard by which all others must be judged?

Thus why this review is only four out of five stars. You see, JBM is so subtle, so complex, that a new tounge will not notice what makes JBM quite so wonderful.

It is a "perfectly" blended coffee. Flavor, bitterness, acidity and aftertaste. On a scale of one to ten, they all rank dead even at five. Every other coffee is like a exaggeration of this hard to get bean.

This should be the first coffee to ever cross the lips of anyone who wants to learn these things. How else can you truely understand the other blends

This is the real deal people.  This is real Jamaican Coffee.  There are a few brands that claim to be from Blue Mountain, but they do not have that authentic taste.  My wife is Jamaican and we have been to Jamaica a few  times, but I never seem to bring back enough coffee so  I set out to find a brand here in the states that would be atleast close to what you get in Jamiaca and this is it.  Wow what flavor

Rooibos is Afrikaans for "red bush." Grown in South Africa's Cederburg Mountains and harvested during the summer, this tea acquires its unique red color as a result of fermentation (in mounds) and oxidization, when it is spread out to dry in the sunlight; naturally it is green.

Rooibos is known for its health benefits stemming from its rich content in vitamins, antioxidants, flavanoids and minerals (inter alia, magnesium, calcium, iron, copper, zinc, potassium, fluoride, manganese and alpha-hydroxy) and has a long tradition of medicinal use among the local Native population; among other things, it is known to help cure asthma, hay fever and other allergies, acne, eczema, colics, indigestion, insomnia, and nervous tension. Containing very few tannins and no caffeine, rooibos has a distinctive aroma and amber color.

This tea blends well with various spices and condiments; my favorite mixture is a delicious loose leaf blend sold by my local tea store, which features orange peel, cinnamon, grated coconut, finely minced chili and red pepper. For a more commercial alternative, though, Tazo's Red Bush tea is a great choice as well: a rich, exquisite blend of rooibos, hibiscus, orange peel, rosemary, several lemon ingredients (lemon myrtle, verbena and balm), as well as a number of sweet spices. Enjoy

I purchased this tea with scepticism because I am a big rooibus fan--I get organic rooibus tea loose and brew it strong with cream.  In general I think rooibus is a good tea that stands on its own--does not need additions.  However, in this case rooibus was used as a base for a nice clean herbal tea blend.  The flavor of rooibus is just the base note.  Congratulations to Tazo for their light touch with hibiscus--if this tea is brewed properly--4 minutes max--it is light and refreshing.  The touch of rosemary really adds a nice freshness to the blend.  If you brew it too long it does decline into a sourness that overshadows the subltety of the other flavors.  I use this when I want a simple herbal tea with no milk

After growing up in Africa, one becomes rather fond of Rooibos tea and I never thought the day would arrive when I would recommend anything but a pure Rooibos tea. Tazo has taken Rooibos tea to a new level by blending African Rooibos (red bush) with hibiscus, lemon myrtle, lemon verbena, orange peel, rosemary, and lemon balm.

Rooibos has quite a distinctive fragrance that reminds me a bit of a fragrant flowers waving in a warm afternoon breeze after an African veld fire. I remember mixing in a tablespoon of condensed milk as a child. Now I mix in powdered milk and honey. Honey seems to bring out the rich flavors in this particular tea blend. 

For some reason, this blend is rather delicious with a toasted and buttered cinnamon/raisin bagel.

I've recently rediscovered the health benefits of Rooibos although I can truly say I've been drinking this tea for most of my existence on this planet. Rooibos is naturally sweet, very aromatic and is high in magnesium, calcium, iron and copper. Mothers in Africa will often add an infusion of this tea to a bottle of milk for babies to cure colic. 

An application of cold Rooibos tea can also aid in clearing the skin or is recommended for allergies, indigestion, insomnia and nervous tension. Just drinking the tea seems to improve your skin due to the high antioxidant levels, 50 times that of green tea! 

This is one of the Tazo teas that should not be steeped for too long because of all the delicate flavors. If you enjoy this tea, you might also want to try Tazo Honeybush tea. I must say that the Tazo company really has my attention with their packaging, amusing tales of ancient Tazo wheels and they know how to blend tea to absolute perfection.

Just look at some of the virtues touted by the producers of California Red Seedless Grapes, 1 lbs:

--Great For Eating With Cheese 
--Great For Fruit Salad And Also Makes A Great Snack For Kids 
--"High in Vitamin A, C & Calcium" 

You can't help sitting back and staring in awe at California Red Seedless Grapes, 1 lbs for it's utility and virtues.  On top of all that, they're SEEDLESS!!!!  Praised by greek philosophers for their healing powers, grapes are loved universally by both Democrats and Republicans...yes, a bipartisan fruit needed so badly in a time of partisan divisiveness, congressional sex scandals and unpopular wars.  Grapes bridge the divide between states, both red and blue.  No one can deny the power and tastiness of California Red Seedless Grapes, 1 lbs

I've been ruling Adab, the biggest little city-state in Sumeria, for almost... Has it been 70 years? Wow, it just seems like yesterday Mesh-Ki-Ang-Nanna was vanquished and the kingship was taken from Urim. LOL. 

Anyways, due to my hectic schedule of riding through the streets, standing atop my jeweled chariot pulled by a team of grunting oxen on my way to the ziggurat, I barely have time to be fed anymore. It's not as if I can be expected to munch on a wieldy leg of lamb during my morning full body shave. 

But then one day a traveler who I had commanded to bring back the finest exoticities from the farthest ends of our flat disc, came to me with a handful of small round pellets. He called them "California Red Seedless Grapes". 

I had him immediately put to death for reciting words I had never heard before, but I was intrigued. And wouldn't you know it, but during my afternoon copulation with two dozen virgins, these grapes were exactly what I needed. I was able to do my usual defiling of whomever I choosed and yet due to the curious vine these pellets hung upon, never once was I unable to calm my disgustingly bloated belly. 

And did I mention the taste? IMHO, It's like a glorious gift from Enlil that both An and Ki have given their blessing to, with the bonus of no seeds. I mean seriously, our Gods are truly seers of all to know that I'm no fan of seeds.

But in conclusion while I still don't know where this "California" is, I know that they have a wonderful fruit, and I hope that soon we conquer them. I also hope they have virgins.

Also since I'm already here, you guys heard the one about the three ox-drivers from Adab? You know, where the punchline is "With elaborate words, with elaborate words, the case of the citizens of Adab was settled. Pa-nijin-jara, their sage, the scholar, the god of Adab, was the scribe."? 

LMAO, that gets me every time

Every single item, especially produce, that comes from Gristedes, is top notch.  If I need a particular fruit or vegetable for a special occasion, I know I can rely on them to provide the highest quality and best tasting fruits and veggies.  I was in hospital recently when a big order arrived and our grown children sat around and ate everything with Dad.  They just couldn't believe how good it was, they said.  Never tasted any red grapes that good.  It's that way with everything.  

I've read some negative reviews of Gristedes.  I don't know what happens to cause things to go South.  I can only say I would order my produce every week from them if I made the time to do it.  And it's not THAT expensive, because we're on a fixed income.  Just treat yourself to something special.  You won't regret it

LOVE these!  These are a great treat at any age.  I bagged the giant cola bottles, giant crocs and gummy bears in a treat bag for my 4th grade students.  They were savoring the giant cola bottles.  I don't blame them.  I find myself chomping on them, too.  I don't even like coca cola

My kid was upset when I got him an improvised Harry Potter broom for Christmas--O.K., it wasn't an officially licensed product, but since magic brooms are imaginary anyway, any stick with a bunch of straw at one end is as good as any other. But no--apparently a Corn Lobby Broom wasn't good enough for him. Anyway, he wouldn't talk to me for a month, which was good at first, but then got really annoying.

For my kid's birthday I decided to get him something really special, so I got him this bag of xanthan gum. I even wrapped it up real nice with wrapping paper and ribbon. My kid opened his present and couldn't figure out what it was. "It's xanthan gum," I told him, "It's gum from outer space. From the planet Xanthan." My kid was busy staring at the label. "No it's not," he slowly replied, and then he began to read, "'Xanthan is made from the outer layer of a tiny, inactive bacterium called Xanthomonas campestris..." "From the planet Xanthan!" I interrupted. Since when did my kid learn to read? I grabbed the bag and opened it. "Here," I stuck a spoon into the white powder, "Try some. It's really good." My kid picked up the spoon and smelled the white powder. "Go on," I said, "you'll really like it!" He hesitated, and then stuck his tongue into the powder. I was starting to get impatient, so I grabbed the spoon from him, "Give it to me, you big chicken," and then I swallowed the powder. The stuff dissolved into a thick, slimy paste in my mouth, but I smiled as I chewed it, "Mmmmm... this is the tastiest xanthan gum in the whole universe!" My kid looked at me as if I were lying. "If you like it so much, then you can have it," he said. "Fine," I replied, "it's too good for you anyway." I figured a little reverse psychology would do the trick. My kid's expression didn't change. "Can I go now?" he asked. "Yeah, fine, get out here," I said. Now I'm stuck with half a pound of xanthan gum and I don't know anyone with wheat allergies or celiac disease I can give this stuff to. Stupid kid

I absolutely am addicted to these.  I was taking Lipitor for my cholestrol and couldn't have pink grapefruit juice or eat pink grapefruit, which I absolutely love.  But these satisfied my craving for it completely plus it didn't interfere with the meds!  I brought the bag to work and put them in my candy jar on my desk and have gotten several other people hooked on them! They're the best

I love the texture of the coffee.  There is no bitterness and it is very smooth - to where I didn't need cream to cut the flavor.  I am usually not a coffee drinker but a friend told me that this is one of the best she ever had.  This was intended to be a christmas gift for her but out of curiosity I bought one for myself to include with the  7 bags for her.  I now know the difference!  Believe me, I had thought that instant tasted way better then "real" coffee until a I had a cup of this java.  I was almost tempted not to give the rest of the coffee away.

Also, the shipment was very fast!  I had ordered this with other items (books and DVDs).  The coffee came in within the week but the other items didn't come in at all.  Infact every time I checked the progress, amazon kept pushing the items further away in the shipment date.  I couldn't understand this at all!  I had to cancel the rest of the order and buy the items elsewhere.  Go figure

This is some of the best coffee I have ever had.  Short of sitting in a Costa Rican resturaunt and having each cup of coffee made right before your eyes, I would suggest buying a bag of these beans.  My family has brought this coffee back with us from Costa Rica when opportunity permits, and now I am very excited that it is available online.  Once you have tried this coffee you will understand how coffee was meant to be consumed

If one has to be on a restricted diet and finds a company, or in this case a bakery that supplies treats to those who can not eat regular sweets, this wonderful bakery is the answer.  Their bagels, danishes and doughnut are very good.  Yes, they are smaller than the usual portions, but the quality is A+.  They have packed their danishes in regular cake pastry boxes and their doughnuts in plastic form cases to protect the doughnuts.  The Service is excellent.  They ship on Monday through Wednesday with two day shipping.  I am a regular customer, especially for their hearty low carb bagels

*****
Tazo's China Green Tips Green Tea is a slightly stronger green tea than Tazo's Zen, and I liked that it doesn't contain Tazo's omnipresent "natural flavors" that almost all of their other teas contain, which to me is not an advantage. I like a natural, real taste with real ingredients sans vague "natural flavors" and sans flavorings, sans essences, etc. China Green Tips delivers this in a cleaner, purer way than Tazo's other teas. I liked this green tea!

The ingredients in China Green Tips are simply spring-harvested green teas from China. It contains caffeine. Note that this review is for the loose tea leaves (in other words, no tea bags!).

Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague and unnecessary for a super premium tea. China Green Tips has none of these "natural flavors" and it shows in the quality and cleanliness of the tea experience.

On the accompanying information with the product, Tazo writes, "a traditional Chinese green tea with a delicate fresh taste and a light green liquor." This is the perfect way to describe this tea! On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of China Green Tips as "grassy, vegetative, sweet, ricey". Tazo describes the aroma as "vegetative, popcorn". 

I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as very good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi or Aspen. Still, this tea is excellent, so I'm breaking my tradition with Tazo teas and giving it five stars. If you enjoy super premium teas, and are stuck with Tazo for some reason, choose China Green Tips and you will be quite satisfied. I can't honestly say that about any other Tazo tea.

The smoothest cup of coffee I have ever enjoyed. Mild yet distinctive in character with a fine finish(the aftertaste in the mouth after you swallow.) 
On a recent visit to Costa Rica, My wife and I visited a Britt coffee plantation. On a very well prepared tour, we were shown the origen and migration of coffee cultivation. In addition we were shown what makes a great coffee, great. 100% Arabica beens grown at high altitude plantations whose soil contains volcanic ash.
The roasts were explained in the following terms;
Light Roast, the smooth tasting coffee with the greatest caffein content. Tastes similar to Chock Full o' Nuts coffee.
Medium Roast, more full bodied.
Dark Roast, Stronger taste similar to many after dinner coffees.
French Roast, stronger yet, fullbodied as you would find at retail coffee shops .

These egg whites work great and are economical.  I recently started a diet where I can only eat egg whites.  It seems such a waste to throw out the yolks, not to mention the mess of separating the eggs.  I use these mostly for baking and to add protein when cooking other foods.  Adding the powder has saved me a lot of time preparing the diet foods.  The powdered egg whites do have an "eggy" odor and have a slight aftertaste which is easily overcome by adding vanilla or other extracts when making protein shakes or other sweets

Recently on a new diet (that works) - Cannot eat whole eggs so was trying to find a large container for a good price. Honeyville grain company has this 2.25 lb can for $14.99. I paid $13.99 for 57 egg white in a 8 oz can - Figure this out - This can has 301 egg whites. 

Also, Steel Cut Oats from Honeville Grain - a 70 oz can for $7.99 - You can't beat this price.

I recently started a diet where I could only eat the egg white, not the yolk because of the fat content. I make a fruit smoothie every morning using egg whites as my protein source. The powdered egg whites have simplified my mornings and saved me alot of time in the kitchen (anyone who has spent time seperating eggs knows what I'm talking about)...not to mention not having to worry about salmonella anymore. I also saved a boatload of money compared to buying the whole eggs. This is a fantastic product and well worth the cost

I use these onions for just about everything.  They are pretty mild and really add a nice, light flavor to your cooking.  This is about what I pay for three pounds so keep that in mind too when you order.  But, then again, it is online shopping for groceries so I guess it has to be pricey.  I use these on a daily basis and never seem to have onion breath!  Great, great stuff and I highly recommend them

I bought a 5lb. bag of these actually, and left my groceries near my desk at work.  Bad move.  My boss, ever the degenerate gambler, decided the best way to entertain himself on a slow day at work, was to have some of us engage in an onion-eating-contest.  Thankfully, the mild and slightly sweet taste of "Fresh Spanish Onions" helped me persevere over my opponent, an intern who we will refer to only as "Will C."  His choice of red onions cost him the match, as well as a date with Carol from accounting (to say nothing of the mess he had to clean up in the men's room, and his doctor's subsequent recomendation that he get a colostomy).  I'd like to thank Bill from Produce at Gristedes for his suggestion of "Fresh Spanish Onions"-- I owe ya one, buddy.  Now if only I could get my sense of smell back

As I lay in my non-oversized, non-jetted tub in my four star hotel in Portland, Oregon -- I unscrew the red plastic top of my beloved Tuscan Whole Milk. I savor the moment, taking a swig from my bottle of whiskey and swishing it slowly before I swallow. I'm building to the moment. Braving up for the inevitable splash of cold, white wonderful as it hits my joyful skin. "Hummana!" I exclaim, as the first drops hit my complimentary shower cap. Won't this be a treat. If only it came with a milkmaid.

Four teAts UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Tuscan Whole Milk Creed:

...And Saint Gristedes raised his glass up on high, saying, "O Lord, bless this Thy empty glass that with it Thou mayest nourish Thine self with Thy mercy." And the Lord did grin and the angles did sing. The Lord spake, saying, "Gristedes, thou shalt receive Thy nectar of Thy grace. The blessed Tuscan Whole Milk!" And Saint Gristedes did gaze upon the light and say, "Oh Lord, how mayest Thy nourish Thine self with such?" And the Lord spake again, saying, "First shalt thou remove the Holy Safety Seal and Holy cap, then shalt hold to Thine mouth. The mouth be the place Thou shalt place the Tuscan Whole Milk, and the place shall be the mouth. Only the mouth shalt be the place, and the place shalt only be the mouth. Once Thou mouth has graced, drink thou thy Tuscan Whole Milk and be nourished, in my sight, with my blessing, forever and ever, till the cows come home." Amen.

As i frantically searched for my movie the Postman, I decided to order some tuscan whole milk. As i serched threw the frist 100 binders i could not find it. Then i heard the knocking on my door, I rushed to find the postman. I opened the box and grabbed the gallon of whole milky goodness. i opened it to hear the popping of freshness. I procedded to drink the whole gallon. Soon after I finished the milk I was blessed with sight beyond sight. I found my movie in the 256 binder, on page 75 in the lower left hand corner. I seen it so brillantly and put it in the dvd player. Unfortantllly I had to wait until my sight was returned to normal. I waited for a total of three months and then I was able to watch my movie. Thank you Tuscan Milk

"This one caught us by surprise! We don't know of any other pod maker that has this flavor and it's really good! We love the way it smells - the way it tastes - and the fact it is just plain different. Most pod people are ignoring the flavored sector to this extent - and it's nice to have a cup of really flavored coffee - meaning - a rich...flavored cup of coffee is hard to come by and this one is very good." - singleservecoffee.com

El Yucateco hot sauces are great. I've been enjoying the red and green for a long time. I also tried the other ones, the Carribean which is good, and the Habanero Extra Hot sauce is exactly what its called, it is hotter than all the others. I think the best El Yucateco I've tried was the Chipotle one, which sadly is not included. Overal El Yucateco has some real good hot sauces which are not just hot but big on flavor

My family has purchased this hot cocoa several times now and whenever we get close to running out we make sure to get more ASAP. We first got it at a local market but now get it through Amazon. We have had great experience with the vendor and the cocoa itself. It can be used for traditional hot choclate without being too sweet like the mass produced brands and makes an excellent mix with Coffee. We have even used it to make cold drinks, ice, milk and Azteca D'Oro is my son's favorite cold drink

Im not sure about the other products out there but this stuff will make you believe your at the theater...the only problem is with the application..there are no instructions and its really thick so i have found the only way is to pour some into a small container (i used an old mustard squirt container) then spread cooked popcorn all level in the maker then apply some liberally on top then mix it all together...after doing that twice the popcorn is perfect the only problem is that itmakes the popcorn maker ALLOT messier then if you applied it somewhere else...good luc

This Butter Flavored Popcorn Topping is perfect if you're looking to make popcorn that tastes like what you get at the movie theatre.  It is a very large bottle, however, so you better like popcorn a lot if you're thinking about purchasing this product.

We have enjoyed Market Spice Tea since our first taste at a local Las Vegas coffee house. When the coffee house closed a couple of years ago we didn't even know how to get it again until last summer when we went to Seattle on vacation. The tea is delicious, ordering it on Amazon was easy, the delivery was fast and we all had it for Christmas

This is by far the best tea you will ever find if you like a bold, in your face, but not overwhelming taste of cinnamon & oranges instead of just flavored water like other teas.  

You must be very careful handling the tea bags from the essential oils they use.  I love to smell tea so I placed the tea bag to my nose and took a whiff, then cried for the next 30 minutes as my nose was on fire!!  No amount of water or soap could remove the burning from the oils that were displaced on my nose.  Also don't directly touch it or reach into the bag with acrylic nails.  I ruined a fresh french manicure and learned the hard way - the essential oils leave a green film on your nails that takes days to wear off.

Other than that, just try it once and you will be hooked like all the others!  My boss introduced this to me after she came back with it from a trip to Seatle.  I've been ordering it ever since along with all my other co-workers who became a addicted.  It will brighten any day!!!!!!

This tea is premium.  Don't accept green tea in bags; it is less tasty and probably less healthy.

Here are just a few medical conditions in which drinking green tea is reputed to be helpful:

* cancer
* rheumatoid arthritis
* high cholesterol levels
* cariovascular disease
* infection
* impaired immune function
 * acne, omg.

And drink four cups a day for the ultimate tea benefits

Drink tea. You'll like the tea. Especially the tea in the big tin. And if you drink enough of this tea, you'll be very healthy - or very awake and jittery. ONe of the two. Either way you can throw the tin at your neighbors when they are having another loud party outside. And that can't be bad

MarketSpice tea is a great, aromatic blend of teas and spices that delivers a rich, full flavor. Unlike any other spice tea I have tried. This tea is great to sip on a brisk winter morning. Be sure to keep the unused tea bags in a tightly sealed container as some of the aromatic oils with evaporate off if left open to the air

This tea is great with a little sugar or honey. It is the kind of tea to have on a cold snowy winter day. Make a cup, sit back wrapped in an afgan, and let your mind wander as you sip this orange spice tasting tea. The longer you leave the tea bag in the hot water, the better.

As a classic Seattle tea, this tea brings back memories of hiding away from the rainy weather sipping a delicious naturally sweet cinnamon citrus tea. When I drink this tea, I am home again. This tea has a unique personality that seems to embody the entire mood of Seattle in one cup. 

This is a delicious tea that should be brewed for at least 5 minutes to bring out all the flavors. You can sweeten this more if you like with Stevia or a natural sugar to enhance the natural sweetness. It is good with a touch of Muscovado Sugar from India Tree.

I am a Seattle native who constantly finds herself living either abroad or on the 'other' coast.  

As an avid tea drinker I frequently find myself with other epicureans and always try to convince them that Market Spice tea is the greatest tea blend EVER!!

Now that I can buy Market Spice on Amazon, I can finally prove it

The scent of this tea brewing is a real wake-me-up.  Cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and orange peel are some of the very redolant flavors.  The cinnamon is so strong that it gives a slight burning  feeling in the mouth--one of my favorite things about this tea.  I'm not a huge tea drinker, but I really enjoy this in winter.  It's great for mulling things as well--apples, pears, and wine.  My only complaint is that it is not 100% reliant on chopped ingredients and there are some flavors added.  But it's still incredibly good and nice for a thoughtful morning or evening.  Makes me miss Seattle, WA and Pike Place Market

I'm very pleased with this tea.  

I boil a pot of water and then take the lid off and let it cool to the right temperature, which is around 200 degrees Fahrenheit.  I let it steep for about five minutes and then remove my infuser and pour myself a cuppa nice, light oolong.  It's good and relaxing.

Arrived in the container seen in the picture, with the tea sealed up in a little plastic bag inside of it.  I'd recommend it

This is the best waffle mix you can buy. I was able to purchase this at Publix for years then it became hard to find. I had to purchase from a online seller buy the case. Not a problem-freezes well for over a year in box. The packs are two to a box-five waffles to a pack(min.). Add blueberries and you have yourself a great breakfest. All other store brand Belgian Waffle mix offered in every store chain pale in comparsion. The person that said this was awful... a few ideas. Heat the water you add for 1 minute in microwave- this makes the dough rise for fluffy waffles-then do the same for the butter you add to the mix ( this adds moisture to the dough) stir in blueberries and everyone here asks for seconds. My husband eats breakfest in Amsterdam six times a month and he has never complained nor made comparisions about these waffles- nothing but excellent taste with a real hint of malt flavoring.
Some math- National Breakfest Chain $7.00 for one Belgian Waffles or 10 waffles for $3.79 plus the cost of the blueberries- how can you beat that! Don't forget the fresh whipped cream

We love the way it smells - the way it tastes - and the fact it is just plain different. Most pod people are ignoring the flavored sector to this extent - and it's nice to have a cup of really flavored coffee - meaning - a rich...flavored cup of coffee is hard to come by and this one is very good." - singleservecoffee.co

I was not sure what to expect upon receiving a box of this tea as a gift during the holiday season, and indeed the ingredients struck me as rather unusual.  Being a person who generally likes my tea and coffee black with no flavoring whatsoever, I was rather suspicious of the orange, grapefruit, and other extra 'scents'.  However, I was delighted with the concoction.  The extras are definately present, giving a slightly citric quality to the tea but are not the least bit overpowering and provide a unique  aroma that is quite pleasing.  

I do recommend steeping it for a long time to get the most out of the leaves, especially if you are to get the citric scents that make it so unique.

I first had this tea served at the Firebird Resturant in New York. They served it in traditional Russian tea glasses with sweetened cherries from Moldavia (no sugar). This is by far the best way to enjoy this fine tea, but even when I'm in less civilized parts of the country Prince Vladimir with a spoonful of sugar is wonderful.

Sing in me oh muse on this snow day, and let me proclaim the many virtues of this fine tea. The scent and flavor of this tea are as close to my conception of ambrosia as anything else that has yet crossed my palate. It is full without being overbearing, it is seasoned without being overpowering. It's great with anything from English breakfast fare to hardy curry. 
Since conception, I have been in love with tea, but "the Prince" was my first fine tea. I have still not recovered from the episode in which my father-in-law-to-be proved to me that bag tea was a crime against humanity. And yet despite amorous flirtations with rare white teas and other wondrous Indian and Chinese estate varieties with unpronounceable names, it's still my favourite.
Never mind the tea purist snobs who rank on it because it's flavored with spice. Would they send back a fine filet because the chef elected to use some pepper or shallots? Ignore the herbal tea-totalers who regard caffeine as sinful. They probably want to outlaw yoga on Sunday too. 
Of the five or so Kousmichoff varieties I've had, this one is the clear winner. I've gotten my best results using HOT water steeping for five to six minutes. The stuff is potent enough that you can get, gasp, a reasonably tannin-free second infusion.
My only reservation is this; once you've entered the universe of fine tea, you can never be satisfied drinking Lipton, Salada, Twinings or Tetley again. In guise of gifts, I have managed to get many of my gastronome friends and relations addicted so that I may sup of it when I visit. Isn't it a delicious irony that perhaps the greatest bourgeoisie decadence of the Romanoff dynasty is  today preserved by our friends in socialist France? Viva la Revolution!

I have used this flask for about a month now - I absolutely love it! I purchased this based on the reputation of the Bodum brand. I have never had a problem with any kind of leakage or spillage. It has tipped over before with no problems, I highly recommend this for anyone

People are always focusing on the 2%, but what about the 98%?

I mean, really....98% is like a 790 on the SAT or an A+ in school or a 3.99 on a 4.00 scale. A 98 is really, really good....just like this milk, the 128 oz. of Tuscan 2% milk in the plastic jug.

But you gotta wonder about the price, I mean, they get the cream for the butter right? You gave up some of your whole milk delights for someone else's butter so I think we should get a price break or something. Or maybe some kind of gift certificate when Tuscan Butter is finally available online

Finally, a healthy alternative to Tuscan Whole Milk.  There are those who will say that the milk of the 2% cow is somehow inferior to that of the larger "whole" cow.  To them I say, hooey!  This milk is nearly 49% as tasty as Tuscan Whole Milk.

My doctor recently told me I'd have to give up Tuscan Whole Milk due to my high cholesterol.  After some angry surfing I came upon Amazon's literally life-saving alternative.  This magical elixir is nearly as potent.  And best of all, no sales tax and super saver shipping!  I can wait a week for my milk, Amazon, just keep giving me that great Tuscan 2% milky goodness

Nothing says 'Taste of Italy' like a gallon of Tuscan's finest.  The aromatic flavor of your favorite vintage is proper with any main course, even veal!  It's even great paired with dessert!  Don't be fooled by cheap imitations folks, this is the real thing!

Remember: If it's Tuscan, it's Kosher!  Now with extra whiteness

Look, nothing is better when it comes to a liquid substance. My gay lover and I tried the whole milk first, but I fear it was too thick.  There was no motion in our ocean! So, I switched to the 2% and everything is peachy.  When we get thirsty, we just pop the cork open and take a swig.  When sweaty, we leave the cork off and roll around and let the milk cover our bodies!  Ahhh, Tuscan Milk.

Okay, maybe the heading exagerates just a tad... Red Popcorn has a MUCH more tender husk than regular popcorn does and when it pops, it explodes the kernel so well that the husks basically disappear.  When it pops, it looks pretty much like any other popcorn, except that the popped kernels are slightly smaller than usual.  The meet is white, but you can see the little bits of red kernel in them.  You would never know that the pretty, white popcorn you were eating started out red-colored if you hadn't seen it before popping.

The flavor is great!  It smelled "toastier" as it was popping than other popcorns we've tried.  We tried it all different ways, with toppings ranging from sweet to savory and every way was good.

We also liked the fact that it is grown by Amish people and are happy to support their efforts to raise their crops the "old way."  They believe in sustainable farming and a clean, wholesome way of life.  No ConAgra multi-national conglomerates here, just real, individual farmers making a living off their land.

Great products raised and produced by real farmers.  What better reasons do you need to buy some of this really tasty popcorn!

I tried making my own fondant 3 times with no success.   Trying to stir the muck recipe books told me to make broke every wooden spoon I had.  This is SO EASY!  The instructions are right on the bag--you just add it to melted butter!  So simple, much easier than everything I have tried in the past.  If you want to make your own candy this is what you need.  Save a wooden spoon, buy dry fondant today

This chocolate was great - the first time I used a fondue fountain I used chocolate chips - I had no idea you have to melt it beforehand in a pot, then add oil to it in order to use it - I ended up adding too much oil and ruined the whole thing - then someone told me about using liquid chocolate - it was so much easier you just have to pour it in.  And the taste was amazing - if I didnt find this I probably would never have used my fountain again..

This chocolate has ruined me for any other.  If you like the Dove dark chocolate candy you will love this.  It's smooth and creamy, like drinking a dark chocolate bar.  And it's not fattening.  Only 100 calories dissolved in 1/3 c. milk; yet it seems to make about 1/2 cup.  That's all you need.  It's rich, filling, and very satisfying.  I just wish amazon had the complete list of products.  This is not for people that like hershey's chocolate!

Being French, these have always been one of my favorites. The reviewer before me obviously didn't know how to cook these, so hear: You must bake them in the oven until they crack open, and even then, let them get slightly burnt. The crispy, blackened parts are always everyone's favorites! 
These sausages are very tasty and highly nutritious, while low-fat (compared to regular sausages), so give them a try!!
The best side dish to go with these is either mashed potatoes, or un-sweetened fresh applesauce (delicieux!).
Enjoy

I eat popcorn all the time and have used this salt for a couple of years.  I disagree that it has a chemical taste, but taste is always pretty subjective. If you like alternatives to salt, give it a try.

...and so far, this sometimes-hard-to-find tea "OM" is the best yet.  The undertones of Peach are stronger than the Cucumber.  The taste is incredible - simultaniously comforting the sipper and awakening their taste buds to the unique mix of green and black tea used in creating this little "treasure in a cup"!  I am hording the last bag I have!

It's certified Organic AND it's Kosher.  What more could you ask for?

The little quote from the back of the paper sleeve Tazo created may convince you - even if my review does not :  "The word Om is frequently seen on prayer wheels, stones and flags as you walk through the Himalayas.  To merely say it releases a vibration of peace.  Imagine what happens when you drink it.

When you have to impress the in-laws or that new girlfriend... or actually whenever you just want the perfect burger!!  These babies are preformed, shrink wrapped, and are perfect for the grill.  I have yet to have one be less than perfect.  The difference between these burgers and the ones from Krogers are immense!  I usually grill mine outside, but even when we put them on the fry pan, they come out fantastic.  I can not recommend these burgers highly enough.

I usually wait until Omaha offers a really good steak deal with free burgers thrown in and then make my order in bulk. Always arrives when they say it will and never fails to please.  One aside... the "extras" like knives and cutting boards are throw-aways... wait til there are good meat sales!!!  Also... try the beef tips... They are to die for!!

Enjoy,

Ja

I recently received a shipment of Omaha burgers.  I normally order the filets.  The burgers were perfect size for a hamburger bun, they are pre-formed and uniformly sized -- that way they're all done cooking at the same time.  The ground beef was high quality and didn't shrink at all and the burgers had full flavor.

They are a little pricey for burgers, but I will order them again for their quality.  They're perfect when having a small group of friends over for a cookout

I received my package via UPS in a reasonable amount of time.  The coffee itself is smooth and very flavorful, but not fake-tasting.  However,I did waste a few pods trying to perfect the use.  For some reason, a couple of cups came out really weak.  So, I referred to the Senseo handbook for a hint.  Now, when I put a pod in, I make sure to smooth it out on top and make sure it is in evenly and snugly.  That seems to have solved the problem.

"This one caught us by surprise! We don't know of any other pod maker that has this flavor and it's really good! We love the way it smells - the way it tastes - and the fact it is just plain different. Most pod people are ignoring the flavored sector to this extent - and it's nice to have a cup of really flavored coffee - meaning - a rich chocolate and raspberry flavored cup of coffee is hard to come by and this one is very good." singleservecoffee.co

This popcorn oil does indeed make your popcorn taste like theater popcorn.  It is simple and easy to use.  I use it in my Whirley-Pop stovetop popper and my popcorn comes out perfect every time.  My family and friends love it.

Gives a really nice taste to popcorn.  I wasn't expecting it to be solid - looks more like shortening than oil, but it does taste good.  You can smell the coconut oil.  Tastes like theater popcorn

I recieved my package today, much quicker than I expected. The items in the set were so fresh; also I really enjoyed the festive packaging. I love Thai food, and have recently am trying to adopt a totally Asian way of cooking for health reasons, I am now in my third week, and have lost 15 pounds, and pain from my fibro and RA is gone. In addition to the health benefits from Thai cooking, is it satisfies my taste...I don't crave fatting spicy foods, or even sweets anymore...:). I encourge those that want to try, to give it a shot...it's not as hard as it looks. If you live in area, such as I do..and have limited access to Thai ingredients, this package will get you on your way..to health wholesome Thai foods...thanks for offering this product...Pa

Having lived in what I consider the coffee capitol of the United States, Portland, I am confident in my personal assertion that Torrefazione Italia was the finest coffee shop out there. The environment was warm and exotic while the coffee was second to none, poured by authentic baristas. Now that these coffee shops have been closed by Starbucks I am thrilled to still be able to purchase the beans here on Amazon. Give them a try and I bet you won't go back to whatever it is that you are drinking now.

The matcha tea is exactly what i expected.  Extremely green, great flavor.  Keep in mind i'm in no way a matcha expert but from my limited experience with this type of tea (starbucks, etc.) it was great.  Got the product within days of ordering it far before the estimated date of delivery.  Highly recommend this seller

Bought to use in a cheesecake recipe that we've been enjoying for a year now using instant powder subsitutes...this is a reasonably-priced nice-sized sample to use. $5 shipping is a bit goofy for a soft 1-oz. packet of powder, but luckily I had a gift certificate. I look forward to trying different recipes with this. Cheesecake tastes good, a lot earthier/more organic now that we have the real matcha. I think I'll try making iced lattes now. Too bad it didn't come in the cute little round tin that they show it in...that was an appealing package but the resealable soft packet is nice too

This was my dad's absolute favorite candy. He loved orange and bittersweet chocolate best of any flavors and this was, for him a match made in heaven. I adore it as well. After my dad passed away, I found a stash of them in his cupboard. They aren't easy to find, but they make a most welcome after-dinner sweet with coffee for guests.

The product description calls the Orangettes "Belgian Vitamin C."  Except for the luxury price, I'm sure Belgians must be pretty healthy with these around.  They're amazing!  The combination of orange peel and chocolate has long been popular, but Leonidas does it very well.  The dark chocolate is very rich, not bitter, and completely covers the orange peel (which retains a good flavor and isn't overly sweet).  Unlike other chocolatiers who often dip the peel only partially, Leonidas has made certain to put their chocolate center stage by using a generous portion.  The result is an addictive treat because the flavors linger on the palate and the Orangettes aren't so sweet as to become cloying.

I don't know if these guys are really going to improve your health, but they will definitely improve your day.  In my opinion, they're worth the money as an occasional purchase and certainly worth a one-time try.  

The packaging is a gold box, wrapped in blue and white Leonidas paper with a gilt deep purple box.  For shipping, the package was placed inside a sturdy styrofoam shell.  Mine arrived within three days and looked like I'd purchased them at the store to give as a gift

This freeze dried peaches are great!  I found freeze dried peaches in my local health food store, but they were so expensive, I was looking for something more economicial.  These fit the bill perfectly.  The peices range in size from a small to a large crouton, great bite sized peices that you can pop into your mouth.  Shipping was fast too, the order was  shipped out on the same day and I had them at my door in less than a week (a lot quicker than when Amazon said they would be delivered)

Marmite is great. its like eating the stuff you would scrape off the sole of your shoe after you'd been walking around in an old factory for a day. I think it tells about the character of a small island population that came to rule the world. Thank god, they left before they had the rest of us eating this filth

For those of us brought up on Vegemite, Marmite doesn't make the grade.  For those brought up on Marmite, Vegemite seems a poor substitute.  For Americans who only seem to put sweet stuff on their cake (oops, I mean "bread") both are revolting.

I think that a major reason why Americans abhor these savoury spreads is that being used to spreading honey and jam on their breakfast toast, they tend to use like quantities of Vegemite or Marmite.  To uninitiated the taste of either spread applied so lavishly is going to be overwhelming.  Before passing judgment on these spreads, you would do well to heed the advice of "Joanna" or "mtspace" and apply thinly. It also works best with very fresh bread or hot toast.

Incidentally, I believe that Marmite was first.  Vegemite was an Australian imitation created several years later.  It was originally called Parwill - a pun which will be appreciated by Aussies and Brits but which may not be understood by Americans because of the way the words are pronounced.

I only give Marmite four stars.  That probably tells you my upbringing

I went to UK for the first time a couple of years back. My friends introduced me to Marmite as something some people enjoyed when they couldn't afford eggs and bacon. The Mr said it was made from a by-product of beer, I thought he was joking at first.  Spread it thinly on a piece of dry toast, served properly, he demonstrated then handed to me. It was surprisingly strong but I liked it. Savory [or savoury as they would spell it] like bacon or other cooked meats but none of the awful fat or grease. It's not terribly hard to find here since the advent of shopping with the wonderful world wide web, so I have been able to enjoy this in the US as a snack between meals on one slice of whole wheat bread, often a late night sandwich with room temperature cheese and tomato.

Marmite is the greatest thing since sliced bread. It is the thing that most ex-pats miss. But it is most definitely NOT Vegemite. That is an entirely different thing. Well - not that entirely different maybe. But, to my mind, Marmite is far superior. It tastes 'meatier', is a glorious glossy brown/black colour, comes in a much nicer jar and makes a lovely drink. 1 teaspoon in a mug of hot water in which you dunk thick slices of buttered bread. Lived on this when a poor student

My first culinary memory involves a surreptitious finger dip into the Marmite jar at the age of three; it is the first food I remember really loving. And ever since then I have had difficulty getting enough of it.  Not everyone reacts to it the same way.  Some imagine it looks too much like axle grease.  Others complain that it smells too much like beer left overnight  to go bad.  These facts suggest that one might only serve it to close friends and only when there are some alternatives. In any case, the Marmite claim "Love it or Hate it"  is quite apropos.  It rarely evokes a neutral reaction.

The best preparation I can think of is to mix it thoroughly with butter.  One part Marmite to two or three parts butter.  Then spread thinly on toast.  Served this way, the primary flavor of Marmite is salt.  Then there is a subtle meaty flavor sometimes called umami - it's a flavor that is present in well browned mushrooms or red meat.  The label suggests that it might be put to excellent use in soup stocks as a  substitute or supplement to caramelized roasted vegetables - onions and carrots.

As for nutritional value, even spread thinly it is dynamite.  Those who fall hopelessly for its charms may find themselves consuming mega-doses of a few crucial B vitamins.  It is an exceptionally rich source of B12, folicin, and B6.  And since it is free of animal products it is an ideal food to include in a Vegan diet which normally falls short in delivering B12.

This contains no corn.  Whoo Hooo.  Finally I can have vanilla bean extract with no alcohol derived from corn or corn syrup.  Corn takes away from the flavor of natural vanilla.  This is the best vanilla extract out there.  You have to try it

This is the best coffee I have ever had!  I've tried each flavor now and they are all fantastic.  The espresso and dark roast are robust yet smooth, not charred at all.  My favorite is the light roast, but all the varieties are flavorful and smooth.  WARNING... THIS STUFF IS ADDICTIVE.  Also, the pods work great in the senseo machine.

My boyfriend and I received two of these gorgeous cucumbers as a surprise gift from a friend.  And what a surprise!  They arrived as fresh as Mother Nature intended.  And they didn't skimp on the size of these suckers either.  And it just so happened I was making gazpacho that night and needed cucumbers when lo and behold the UPS delivery lady rang my bell.  Boy did we get a lot of pleasure out of these babies.  If you want to brighten someone's day, give the gift of cucumbers

Oh how I love the most delicious, incredible, edible fruit of the plant, Cucumis sativus.  Who would've thought that this was a member of the gourd family, Cucurbitaceae--a cousin of the melon?

Cucumbers have many great uses.  They're delicious in salads, and is there any snack tastier than a pickle?  I also hear they have non-culinary uses as well.  Some say cucumbers help to reduce the swelling around eyes or the bags under the eyes....maybe that's because they're 90% water.  I've also heard that there are more "adult" uses for the cucumber, but I've only seen that in movies

Hard to imagine something could make one's honey even sweeter, but this fills the bill. The little jars make it easy for you to try different flavors (as opposed to being stuck with a large quantity of one). All of them were quite yummy, too. The only thing I would change is the brush that's included -- it's tiny, which makes it fun to tease and do little bits at a time, but it could be just a bit broader. The bristles tend to get overwhelmed by the chocolate. Then you just use your fingers..

I was treated to this sauce while in Canada for a friends wedding recently.  I have to say, it is easily the best steak/brown sauce I've ever had - it's sweet and tangy and spicy all at the same time, but not overpoweringly so.  The sauce seems extremely versatile and would be excellent over steak, poultry, burgers, fries - and I'm sure would be a fantastic marinade as well

If you like smashing things, this does the job nicely. I smiled taking it out of the box. It is quite heavy and large. Very nice open bowl with large capacity.

I highly recommend this as a workhorse. Warning: you may need a second smaller mortar if you pour/dump from your mortar often as this is very heavy. But this is very handy for working with larger items or quantities

I've tasted different rice varieties and this one is incomparable in taste and texture. Some of you may be skeptical but this special variety is short and plump but has a nice shine and not brittle when it is steamed. Also the texture is smooth as you eat it along with your favorite foods. Excellent for sushi. People who like their cooked rice a bit glutinuous will love this

Tazo Chai Organic Spiced Black Tea is a blend of black tea, ginger, cinnamon, black pepper, cardamom, cloves and star anise. These items are all organically grown and this creates a sense of purity and clarity of thought. 

The tea has a delicious rich flavor and is perfectly blended for an ultimate Chai experience. Delicious when you add a packet of Stevia and a swirling of lavender honey. Milk powder makes this richer and a splash of cream makes it luxurious. 

While drinking this tea you are transported to India where Chai wallahs sooth your soul with a cup of spicy tea. Each cup of Tazo tea is an adventure.

****
Tazo's Chai Black Tea is an enjoyable chai experience for the most part. On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a rich blend of teas and spices in the style of the hill dwellers of the Himalayas." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Chai as "cinnamon, creamy, sweet spice" and "medium-bodied yet full-flavored, with the spicy kick of cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, and black pepper. Tazo describes the aroma as "sweet, spice". Those are pretty accurate. The black tea "blend" is a little bitter, though, even with minimal brewing. It's a real trick to get it to brew long enough to get to experience the flavor from the spices without having the tea turn bitter.

The ingredients in Chai are: black teas, ginger, cinnamon, black pepper, cardamom, cloves, and star anise. It is caffeinated. 

Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.

I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Chai gets only four stars.

The "crema" was pretty thick as it brewed, and the coffee appeared to have a nice dark color. We got a nice strong aroma of coffee and preceded to add some milk (1%) and sugar. 

Our first impressions...good flavor...a nice cup of coffee. We did enjoy the cup of coffee

We don't know of any other pod maker that has this flavor and it's really good! We love the way it smells - the way it tastes - and the fact it is just plain different. Most pod people are ignoring the flavored sector to this extent - and it's nice to have a cup of really flavored coffee! Review from singleservecoffee.com

If it is possible to fall madly in love with a box of chocolates, then the assortment is the perfect place to start such an adventure. These chocolate are named after Leonidas Kestekidis, who definitely knew how to create chocolates for the true chocolate connoisseur. 

When he moved back to Belgium he not only married his true love, he created chocolates the world now adores. When you taste these chocolates, your taste buds will also finally know true chocolate happiness. Whether you try one of these with a cup of coffee or tea or enjoy one as a daily indulgence, these will impress. 

The "I Love You" chocolate with dreamy lemon filling embodies this sentiment. Each chocolate has a unique design and the I Love You chocolate has two hearts, ribbons and a seal. After you sample the variety of chocolates, specific flavors will stand out as favorites. 

Here are my favorite creamy fillings (ganache and butter cream) which come in dark, white and milk chocolate depending on the selection: 

Antoinette - A smooth Brandy flavored ganache 

Lingoit Lait - Absolutely delicious vanilla flavored fresh butter cream filling. Time definitely stopped while tasting this chocolate. 

Irrsistible - Dark chocolate and Strawberry sauce. 

For ever - If you love coffee this may be one of the most delicious milk or dark chocolate chocolates ever made as it is filled with a special coffee cream that has hints of caramel. I ordered an entire box of these and they come in a variety of flavors. The milk chocolate and cherry filling is like Claude Debussy's Rverie. It is difficult to describe besides saying it is like a delicate cherry icing wrapped in milk chocolate. 

Merveilleux - Milk or dark chocolate filled with coffee ganache. 

Europe - Dark or milk chocolate filled with rum filling. 

Ganache - Milk or dark chocolate with pure ganache. 

Tosca - Milk chocolate with a special ganache. 

Posie - Dark chocolate and a Cointreau filling. 

Antoinette - Delicate caramel hints in the milk chocolate coating mingle nicely with the vanilla filling. 

Eve - Milk or dark chocolate with a creamy dreamy banana filling. 

Alexandre le grand - A milk or dark chocolate with caramel cream. 

Also Recommended: 

If you wish to also try the Napolitains, I'd suggest the 1 pound sampler Ballotin with six varieties. You may also want to look for the new Palet d'Or. A deeply delicious and strong bitter chocolate filled with ganache. The center is made with butter, cream and chocolate and the outer coating is a masterpiece with gold decorations. 

Leonidas now has over 1700 stores and sales locations worldwide and they offer over 80 varieties of fresh chocolates. The chocolates are air freighted weekly from Brussels so you will always find the quality to be superior. 

My chocolates arrived fast and were as fresh as if I had purchased them in Belgium. They were carefully packaged in the famous gold boxes with signature/seasonal wrapping and a ribbon. The boxes were then placed in protective Styrofoam containers to protect the chocolates during shipping. The expedited shipping is recommended from May to early September.

When we traveled in Belgium some years ago, we were constantly tempted by chocolate.  There was a Godiva store on every corner with uniform overstuffed waxy tasting chocolates.  Someone suggested we try Leonidas, and it was a revelation!! Half the  price of Godiva's chocolates and lightyears more flavorful and more like the artisanal chocolates that are so popular now.  The flavors were more interesting, the finish more refined, and the dark chocolate more full of cocoa bitterness and depth.  Leonidas is IT as far as Belgian chocolates are concerned

In my case it was for my dad's birthday a couple days ago, and it went great. I placed my order a week before the event (I know, probably could have been too late), but it arrived 3 days later, packaged really well in dry ice. If you're looking for a gift for a male relative, you will never go wrong with getting him some Omaha Steaks

After reading the reviews, I was hesitant.  However, I've gotten a perfect cup every time so far with my Senseo.    

The coffee is very good, but it has fallen a little short of my expectations. I've previously brought Kona back from my Hawaiian vacations and ground it myself.   The pod coffee is not quite as good as fresh ground.

UPDATE:  for my next shipment, this two-cup style was backordered.  Aloha Island Coffee Co. sent me the equivalent amount of coffee in single-cup style pods instead.   I've found these pods to work better, fit the Senseo machine better, and this coffee now does tasted just as good (or better) than fresh ground whole bean Kona!

I think the single-pod style is quite a bit more expensive than two-cup style, but the difference is definitely noticeable

These kona pods are the highest quality pods that I have found yet. I love kona coffee so I was extremely pleased to find these pods. They certainly cost a little more than other cheap pods but it's worth it especially when you consider what you pay for a cup of coffee at retail. Now I have the best coffee in the world at home for less...

Yes the coffee is the best quality, pesticide free.  There are technical issues with the pods. 1 pod was broken when I opened up the pouch it was stored in.  For any pods to arrive broken when they are so expensive is just not acceptable.  Also, many times the pod is not working, but turning it around and pressing down on it with a fork or a spoon makes it work (I have Black & Decker Home Cafe Machine).  Great coffee, but I felt that I had to really work for it.  I also feel that to charage $15 to ship a box of coffee pods is a bit excessive, considering that they are being shiped from LA not HI

As a bachelor who frequently must grab a cup of joe at home and run, i was reluctant to waste coffee in my Braun drip machine, and disinclined to clean up after the French Press method.  A New York Times article convinced me that a Pod system would be the way to go, and i found the Philips Senseo machine to be the best at the consumer level.  Alas, the Douwe Egberts pods that come with are, um, IMHO, not good.

A brief web search led me to Aloha Island's Senseo-style pods, and i ordered a box of their single serving espresso pods.  The package arrived swiftly, and the box of pods was swaddled in styro-peanuts:  nice touch!  i immediately placed a pair in the Senseo unit and let it do its thing.  Wow!  The quality of the coffee is, to date, unparalled.  Rich, smooth, and frothy, almost like a latte before the milk is added.  And i was surprised that the yield was about one ounce greater than with the DE pods.

I'm a believer, an advocate, and a confirmed drinker and fan.  Thanks and Mahalo

This is the Japanese version of breadcrumb (pan=bread, a Portuguese loan-word, and&quot;ko-&quot;  is &quot;child of&quot; or of &quot;derived from&quot;.) Panko are used for katsudon, tonkatsu or cutlets served on rice or in soups. The cutlets, pounded chicken or pork, are coated with these light and crispy crumbs and fried. They are not gritty and dense like regular crumbs. They are very nice on deep fried shrimps and decorative for a more gourmet touch

Teas vary greatly in quality and the price reflects that.  This is a moderately price matcha tea so don't except the best flavor.  It is nutritious so it may be better as a flavor additive to drinks, desserts, broth, etc.  Real matcha can also be bitter and an acquired taste.  Japanese often drink it with tiny sugar candies to offset the bitterness.  Matcha also contains a lot of antioxidants so it may be helpful to some to stat incorporating it into their diet.  If you don't like the taste an easy drink is to mix it with orange juice

My husband loved receiving this package in front of his co-workers. There was hardly anything left when he came home from work. The packaging was beautifully done and everything was delicious that he received. All of his co-workers wanted to know who the company was. I e-mailed them the name of the company so I am so sure they will probably order for Easter, I know I will. You should too for friends,relatives retirement homes and anyone you can think of. The company is very responsive and takes care of its customers down to the last detail.

Adagio has outdone themselves with this creation.  Jasmine Bloom Display Tea starts out as a tight ball of leaves, the size of a quarter.  Add some hot water, and the ball unfurls it's leaves of Jasmine green tea revealing a strand of delicate white flowers arching over the green tea starburst.  The aroma is a delicate, perfumed scent of Jasmine blossoms, the color is a pale green, and the taste is light and mellow.  The hand-tied tea blooms are nicer to look at than taste, however, I recommend trying this tea just for the fun of it.

This sauce is medium heat for everyday use.  It has an excellent roasted pepper flavor, and there is *NO VINEGAR* to get in the way.  Consequently, you get exactly what one should expect from a pepper sauce...versatility and flavor that does not try to smother the character of the food you season with it.

An every-day sauce should not leave a patina on your tongue.  This is not a boutique novelty, it's a household staple.  The 32 oz. size is the right size for a hot sauce household.

You want good?  Try Tapatio on cottage cheese.  You'll never eat cottage cheese any other way again, I promise.

I use it on just about anything except cereal and ice cream, but my personal favorite applications of Tapatio are:

eggs
potatoes
pizza
anything creole (forget tabasco!)
cottage cheese
most rice
mac cheese
and of course...Mex

In my opinion, this is the best sauce in your local grocery store

I've tried this and it seems to be both better and cheaper than Bob's Red Mill brand. Buying it like this brings the total price down to around $7.40 per bag..the best deal for people needing to replace the regular flour in their diet. The only thing I can suggest is to carefully store this flour as it can go stale before you use it all. I would suggest a good glass or heavy plastic, sealable container which can go in the fridge. Also you can buy this directly from Honeyville for cheaper

And at my age that is saying something.  I have a Bunn My Cafe that I purchased on Amazon and after I received it I bought some Aloha Island Pods. They are all wonderful, but the Lava Java is fabulous.  I like a darker roast coffee with a lot of flavor but I do not want it to taste smokey or burned.  I will continue to order this amazing variety along with a couple others from Aloha Island.  They are more expensive than some others but if coffee is important to you then treat yourself to these pods.  You will not regret it

My cousin started the Atkin's diet to lose weight before his wedding.  I was getting married 2 months after him and needed a diet buddy.  Since we worked & lunched together it was perfect.  He was eating pasta one day and told me that I could have pasta too as long as it's Dreamfields.  He suggested that I buy the Victoria's Organic Tomato & Basil sauce it's lower in carbs (4 net carbs per cup).  I bought it and added a splash of red wine, a bit of garlic, some fresh frozen basil leaves crumbled up and a dash of salt and pepper.  I had a low carb spaghetti dish that my Italian fiance drooled over... haha!  Good stuff.  Just be sure to follow the directions so that it's not over cooked ;o)

Whether you are diabetic, eating low carb, or just want great pasta, this product is perfect in every way.  I have served dreamfields pasta to over twenty people, told them I was trying a new brand of pasta, and asked them what they thought.  Every last person said it was wonderful, and not one person guessed that it was not "regular" pasta.  Most said it was better than the pasta they use.  Try it...you'll love it

I love this salt and use it on my french fries as well as on popcorn. It is not as good as fleur de sel or some of the other "gourmet" salts, but it is only 15 cents per ounce, not 15 dollars. Note that this salt is flaked, unlike the normal crystals for which Diamond Salt is known. It absolutely CLINGS to the surface of the popcorn, fries, and other similarly-textured foods MUCH better. It has a cleaner taste than some of the brown or grey sea salts and CLEAN is always good in my book. 

As a treat, I sometimes Iick the tip of my index finger, sprinkle a little of this on it, and then pretend like I'm getting ready to do a mini tequilla shooter, but without the lime. Almost like a couple of hours on the beach. 

I can only give it four stars instead of five because it is NOT IODIZED and you could end up looking just like a frog with big goiter things on your neck if you don't get enough iodine. This is not a problem for people who eat a lot of seafood, but if you live in the Midwest far from the ocean it could cause some difficulties.

These burgers are unbelievable. They are really fresh and juicy burgers with a distinctive meaty taste you will fall in love with if you love a great burger.  They are Omaha Steaks best product and the only thing I order from them. I actually love the packaging. Each burger comes individually wrapped in vacuum sealed plastic, which means I can keep them in the freezer until I am ready to eat them. Then defrost them in warm water and in 10 minutes I have fresh red meat, they have a nice peppery Angus beef smell, and they taste great. They never go to waste.  I find the meat I buy in the stores these days can't compare at all. Them smell of the meat doesn't smell fresh - more like plastic than meat. Ok, the Styrofoam cooler is a waste of packaging, and not environmentally friendly but they can be reused several times.

Amazon also has a great price on these. After a quick search around the web, this looks to be the best price

****
Tazo's Wild Sweet Orange Herbal Infusion is a nice orange herbal tea. It contains lemongrass, blackberry leaves, citric acid, rose hips, spearmint leaves, natural flavors, orange peel, safflowers, hibiscus flowers, rose petals, natural orange essence, ginger root and licorice root. It is not sweet, very fruity, and not subtle at all, a wonderful tea if you enjoy orangey teas.

Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.

On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a lively blend of sweet citrus herbs and orange essences. Sweet, yet tart, this is a cup of liquid sunshine, radiating multi-layered orange flavors with exotic hints of spice and a distinctive floral finish. Wild, indeed." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Wild Sweet Orange as "tart, sweet, smooth, licorice". Tazo describes the aroma as "oranges, roses, lime".  This is pretty accurate, although the words give hope that the taste of the tea never quite approaches.

I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Wild Sweet Orange gets only four stars.

This is the story of two Tazo teas. I found that they almost need one another to produce a tea of exceptional quality. 

I tried each tea separately and finally blended them together. Tazo Lotus and Tazo Wild Sweet Orange make a wonderful lemony hot tea in the winter or enjoy being tossed about with ice cubes in the summer. 

The way I make this tea is by steeping two Lotus and two Wild Sweet Orange filterbags with 16 ounces of water. I make this in my coffee maker so there is plenty of time for the flavors to seep out into the steaming water. Then, you can add 2 tablespoons of orange blossom honey for hot tea and a bit more for ice tea. 

Drinking this blend is an aromatic experience. Lotus Decaffeinated Green tea is a blend of naturally decaffeinated green tea, natural lotus flower flavor and other natural flavors. Wild Sweet Orange is a blend of lemongrass, blackberry leaves, citric acid, rose hips, spearmint leaves, natural flavors, orange peel, safflowers, hibiscus flowers, rose petals, natural orange essence, ginger root and licorice root. 

I love the crinkly sound of the paper bags protecting the precious contents. The boxes are also quite intriguing and the stories on the tea packets are always mysterious and playful. 

A romantic tea with a golden-orange color. I can never decide if I like this best hot or cold, so I end up drinking it hot and cold. Half on ice and half in a mug. When this tea is hot, it is much more romantic and aromatic. When chilled it takes on a more bitter component. 

For something even more exotic, try the Tazo Green Ginger tea. That was the first Tazo tea I tasted and so far I can't think of a Tazo tea I don't love.

****
Tazo's Passion Herbal Infusion is a somewhat tart, deep, flavorful (hibiscus-y tasting) tea. It is not berry-like in taste, although it is red in color. It's difficult to describe what hibiscus tastes like, but I find it a most pleasant taste. My husband says it tastes like pomegranate to him. Although Passion contains licorice root it is not sweet. 

The ingredients in Passion are: hibiscus flowers, natural tropical flavors, citric acid, orange peel, licorice root, cinnamon bark, rose hips, lemongrass and red poppy. It is caffeine-free!

Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.

On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "A tantalizing deep red tea made from hibiscus flowers, exotic herbs and natural tropical flavors." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Passion as "berry, juicy, wine-like, merlot, sweet, earthy, dense". Tazo describes the aroma as "sweet, juicy, red fruits". 

I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as very good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Passion gets only four stars.

Tazo Teas is a relative newcomer to the tea market, having been founded in 1994 by Steve Smith. But, what Tazo lacks in history it makes up for in pure inventiveness!

Among Tazo's many blends is Passion, a bold and flavorful mixture of hibiscus flowers, other tropical flavors, citric acid, orange peel, licorice root, cinnamon bark, rose hips, lemongrass, and red poppy. Brew it up, and you are rewarded with a bright red infusion, that has a tart and exciting taste.

Now, this tea is definitely not for everyone. As you can tell from the ingredients, this tea is strong and decidedly on the tart side. When drunk hot, you probably will want to sweeten it with honey or moderate it with milk, or possibly both. But, when made into an iced tea, Passion really comes into its own - decidedly refreshing and thirst-quenching. Just what you need for a hot summer day!

So, overall I would say that this is a pretty darn good hot tea, and a great iced tea. Buy some today

I was first introduced to this tea at Starbucks. They marketed it as Shaken Passion Tea. It tastes great when served hot, but when iced, it really shines.

Bear in mind that this is a herabl infusion and not a traditional tea. The color is a deep ruby red and the taste....it is indescribable. When served slightly sweet with a spring of mint it is the perfect summer refresher.

If you want a break from traditional black or green teas or are watching your caffeiene intake this is the perfect subsitution

The deep purple/red color and hibiscus fragrance is enough to make anyone passionate about tea. Yet, is this really tea? It looks like tea, but it is really an herbal infusion made by steeping hibiscus flowers, orange peel, licorice, cinnamon, rose hips, lemongrass and red poppy in a swirling of hot water. 

The flavor is slightly reminiscent of hot apple cider or hot cranberry juice. This tea leaves a tingle on your tongue and I think it goes very well with a spoonful of honey. 

I recently discovered Tazo Teas ad have been immersing myself in the mysterious experience with a sense of abandon. So far I've tried most of the flavors and have been impressed. I do think you need two tea bags for each cup of tea to fully intoxicate the senses and experience the magic of the ingredients. 

Caffeine Free. You can drink this as you type into the night...

My family and I tried Omaha Steaks Hamburgers about 6 months ago and have purchased 3 of these picnic packs.  You have never tasted a hot dog until you have tried one of these 3oz dogs!  I would never return to regular grocery store hot dogs!  Definitely worth the money.  The nice feature is that you can order them and have them delivered whenever you want.  Even in warm climates, whatever you order will come in a cooler and packed well with ice.  Order a couple at the beginning of the Summer, and BBQ until your heart is content

I've been trying for 2 weeks now, adding 1-teaspoon to my normal shake or yogurt.  It dissolves easily.  I feel more energy throughout the morning hours.  What I like best is that it's from Brazil so it's the real thing and less expensive than other brands.  The label was folded over a bit but that's ok.  They ship fast - it arrived in my mailbox in 3 days.  Thanks Amazon for offering unique items such as this...

In my experiences with Indian cuisine from patronizing local restaurants owned and operated by native Indian folks, this is quite comparable and the flavors are very similar.  It's nice to be able to open a package of Indian food to eat with some Basmati rice quickly. Recommended.

Some of the flavors are spicy.

I have enjoyed eating Marzipan, since a child.  Now many, many
years later I still enjoy eating it on Holidays. It is a combination of cooking and artwork. This Wisconsin Cheeseman,
company makes the best Marzipan I have ever had.  It is not too
sweet like most others make it, and it light and not doughy.
Eating their Marzipan is a blissful experience, and after a busy
day of working, this is my private joy.  I highly recommend it,
and I feel that everyone should try Marzipan at least once in
their life, you will not be sorry

I love these!  They stay crunchy even after the bag has been open awhile.  I love the sesame taste.  They's not a dead ringer for pretzels, but they's so good in their own right.  They're much lighter than traditional pretzels and without the heavy texture and taste.  Just a really delightful, light crispy treat.  I think any Celiac would be thrilled to find these

This is by far the most enjoyable hot chocolate I've ever come across for consumer purchase.  It is high in calories and expensive, but if you are looking for a rich, comforting cup of chocolate, this is it.  This hot chocolate is thick and delicious in the European sense, yet not overly sweet as many American brands are.  Unfortunately, MarieBelle is neither organic nor fair trade, but if that is not important to you then there is no downside.  

I've found no other maker produces a finer cup of chocolate, save the City Bakery in NYC--which is the next best thing to Parisian hot chocolate

I have searched high and low to find a high-quality sugar free, dairy free chocolate bar that tasted just like the real thing, and I can honestly say that these amazing chocolate bars fit the bill perfectly!  Ross Chocolates has truly done it--I could not tell the difference between these and the kind made with sugar and dairy.  These dark chocolate bars are perfect for anyone looking for a pure, healthy alternative to the standard sugar-laden chocolate bar out there.  I am hypoglycemic, so normal sugary candy isn't an option for me.  These bars, though, have no impact on my blood sugar--in fact, I feel even better after eating them and have no negative reactions whatsoever!  They are also perfect for people who are allergic to dairy (like myself) because they are completely dairy-free.  As an added bonus, each bar contains 3 grams of fiber!  The bars have a wonderul, fresh crunch to them, with none of the strange aftertaste common to some products sweetened with sugar alcohols.  I honestly couldn't tell the difference between these maltitol-sweetened bars and those sweetened by regular sugar.  Enjoy

Neuske's Bacon is simply the most divine bacon eating experience you'll ever have.  Smoked in Wisconsin over applewood, it is delectable, luscious even.  They cut it lean so that there is no rubbery, fatty bits like you find in store-bought brands, yet they leave enough in to give it that robust flavor.  It is worth noting that America's Test Kitchen did a Taste Test of Bacon, in which Neuske's was a participant.  It did NOT come out as No.1, because tasters thought it was "too smoky".  If you like smoky bacon like I do, that sounds like crazy talk, and you should definitely try this bacon.  The results of the taste test indicates to me that there are those who prefer their bacon less smoky, and I suppose that if you are one of those people, you may not like this bacon after all (even thought it is the best ever).

Be careful though: once you eat Neuske's and love it, you won't be satisfied with store-bought ever again

I bought this tea from a dot-head store.  I'm usually a decaf coffee drinker, but when ill I make this.  I usually put a spoon full in a huge plastic cup (like McDonalds large) with bottled water and heat for 4 minutes in microwave, remove, stir, and strain into large coffee mug.  I ALWAYS have too damn much tea leaves left in cup, but I like it strong.  It'd be nice if there were instructions on how much to use.  BTW, is this stuff decaffeinated

I just brewed my first batch and this is by far the best green tea I've tried.  My family will have to live with less this batch because my first sample cup quickly turned into 3 big cups!  Yummmmmmmm.

Don't know what some of the other folks here are talking about when they say it smells/tastes bad.  Smells just like some of the better-quality green tea in teabags, but stronger, sweeter and much richer.  Taste is smoother, no bitterness, much fuller, and surprisingly long-lasting.  I'm no tea connoisseur, I just know what I like and this one is awesome.

A little research on the web helped.  The general consensus seems to be that 160-180 degree water is the best, brewed about 2 minutes.  I don't have a thermometer or anything fancy so I brought the water just to boiling and waited 5 minutes before using.  Brewed 2 minutes then poured through a strainer into a pitcher.

If you're willing to go through a bit of extra trouble, you can use the same leaves up to 3 times.  A little goes a long way.  I used about 2 rounded tablespoons, brewed 3 times, and got more than a full pitcher of nice strong tea.  I like my tea strong, and it looks like 2 level tablespoons would still do the job nicely.  Use less for something milder

I have tried many brands of Green tea from in the US and while visiting China. I have found this brand to be superior in flavor. The price is also surprisingly affordable. 

I agree not to allow it to steep over 3 minutes, as it does affect the flavor.

Tastykake's Butterscotch Krimpets are the favorite food of the title character in the fifth grade story of Maniac Magee by Jerry Spinelli.  They are a light and delicious treat that we passed out to a fifth grade class in Speedway, IN.  The kids thoroughly enjoyed the book and were thrilled to have their very own Butterscotch Krimpets to enjoy, too.  There are two to a pack - 6 packs to a box - reasonably priced - light and delicious - no cream filling, only a light butterscotch frosting.  The awaiting treat made this a good reason to finish the book

Great, I buy them for the kids in my class when we read a book called Maniac Magee. We can't find them in our area. The boy in the book is obsessed with Butterscotch Krimpets and the kids wanted to know why. So I ordered them and now whenever the author mentions Butterscotch Krimpets they all moan and ask if I can't order somemore. Unfortunately, they were too expensive to order again. The shipping was $5 dollars more than 4 boxes of the Krimpets. But they sure were good

I was a bit skeptical when I purchased what is a hybrid product: sprouts and curry - humph.  Actually, surprisingly good and filling.  For those on the job, Tasty Bite is solid choice for microwave fast food - and this vegan treat works, better, in fact, than many of their more traditional offerings

We (my son and I) purchased this gift set for my wife on Valentines day.  Although it was pricey relative to the Target/Walmart selections the price was worth it.  

We enjoyed the various unique flavors and the well decorated candies.  We would purchase this or similar set from Godiva again.  It was worth the price and was well recieved.

Whether enjoyed as a gift for others or yourself, there is something about the G collection that consistently leaves you wishing for just ONE more piece. The brown-and-lime faux-leather box, a treat for the eyes in itself, contains 15 pieces of what can only be described as Godiva's most ambitious and delicious chocolates to date. The 15-piece G Collection closely mirrors the more expensive "American Pies" collection, but provides many unique and otherwise unobtainable pieces that more than justify the cost of the set.

The rich, all-encompassing flavor of the G Collection's fruit pieces is on par with the "American Pies" collection: Key Lime and Cherry stand out, bursting from their fragile, sugar-coated shells with an intense and supremely enjoyable tang. A box of this size ought to last - one will quickly find that the richness (to overuse the word) marks these candies as individual luxuries to be enjoyed over time. Simply scarfing these down simply will not to justice to the complex, excellent job Godiva has done in blending different ingredients to make authentic, mouth-watering flavors.

Godiva's G Collection can never be explained satisfactorily until they are tried. Only on the tastebuds can an accurate and deserving review of these milestone candies be written

Unless you were a wealthy chocoholic, you would probably never blow the 50$ on these.  As a gift however, this is a great box (there is a similar all heart shaped box for Valentines - which is cool if you dig hearts).  It fits all the qualities I look for in a gift.  Its extravagant, its something the person I give it to will love, and its something they wouldn't get themselves.  I tried 2 of these, the mixed berry is ridiculously good.  The peanut butter and jelly was interesting.  Everything is superb quality wise.  I knock it down a bit on price, but honestly, its tough to find fault in this product.  It much much better than regular Godiva (which I find to be super sweet and overpriced)

Regular Godiva pieces are great, but they're still chocolate.  I actually dislike some regular Godiva pieces (truffles are too sweet and caramels are similar to See's caramels).  But the G collection is fantstic.  The presentation is stunning, from the packaging to the airbrushed pieces.  And the taste is incredible.  The original flavors gave me pause (peanut butter and jelly?) but they work so, so well and taste better than any chocolate I've ever had.  Each piece averages to $3, but every piece is way better than $3 of candy bars or ice cream.  Most pieces are better than $12 desserts from 5-star restaurants.  So while the price seems extreme, once you taste a piece you will understand that it SO WORTH IT.  A perfect gift for a discerning chocolate lover and for yourself

I am a huge fan of Tasty Bite products, and was delighted to find that Amazon now stocks them, since they are expensive in my small town (no Trader Joe's here!). I was excited to see this variety that I had never tried before, and readily ordered the six pack of these noodles with peanut sauce, expecting the same ready-to-eat food that the other Tasty Bites I have tried offer.

But unlike their ready-to-eat rice dishes in which the rice and the packet merely need heating but are already fully cooked, the noodles here are in their raw state and need to be boiled for ten minutes, so you can't grab this and bring it to work the way you can most other Tasty Bite meals.

Also, the peanut sauce has a delectable and complex flavor, but is spiced and textured so that I felt it really needed some vegetables and or meat to round it out. I love spicy dishes, but this meal seemed planned to be overly spiced so that when you add the veggies and meat, it would be perfect.

So, as a quick meal starter at home or as a way of helping to use up leftover meat and veggies, this gets five stars. It was delicious. Some additions I have enjoyed are chicken, steak, bell pepper, cauliflower, carrots, eggplant, and sweet potato. 

But I am giving this meal four stars overall because my expectation from eating other Tasty Bite entrees was that this was a grab and go meal that I could pop in the microwave and have prepared in a couple of minutes.

Once you see the book that accompanies this starter kit, you will realize two things. You won't be making sushi anytime soon without a few more items. Not only do you need fresh ingredients, you need things that are listed in the recipes to make Miso, to make Number-one Dashi and Number-two Dashi. You need Bonito flakes and kombu, you need things like bamboo leaves too. OK, so you don't need bamboo leaves, but having a bamboo plant around the house wouldn't hurt. 

The book is especially helpful, but to make the sushi rice professionally, you do need to also order a rice-cooling tub (hangiri). A square omelet pan is needed, but not essential. You can adapt by using a regular pan. 

Just add your fresh ingredients is the understatement of the year. You do get a sushi press, a sushi mat and Nishiki Sushi rice. The sushi Nori is essential as is the ginger, wassabi, soy sauce, rice vinegar, sweet wine (mirin) and white sesame seeds. 

Other items you will want to have on hand when this arrives: 

Chopsticks
Ginger Grater
Chopping Board
Fish Knives (sushi knives)
Plates for serving Sushi (not essential but make it more interesting)
Skewers - for when you cook shrimp
Rice Maker
Stainless Steel Colander
Wooden Rice Paddle - or you can use a wooden spoon

Ingredients: 

Avocados
Cucumber
Carrots
Asparagus
Chives
Eggplant
Daikon Radish
Fresh Shiitake mushrooms
Lotus Root
Kombu
Miso paste
Ocha - tea
Sake
Shiso - an aromatic herb
Snow Peas
Sushi Vinegar called Awasezu
Tofu - various types but Japanese Silken is recommended
Wakame Seaweed


Recommended Seafood selections include: Mackerel, Salmon, Crabs, Blue-Eye Cod, Tuna, Herring, Sea Bass and numerous other selections. I will be making mine with cooked fish for the most part and many of the recipes indicate cooking the shrimp. 

The book gives excellent full-color picture step-by-step instructions for preparing
seafood. Everything from cleaning squid to angled cuts for sahimi. 

Prepare to learn an ancient art form. This is serious cooking with gourmet appeal. There are instructions for making garnishes and dipping sauces. 

The Tuna Rolls are probably going to be one of the first items to make because they have few ingredients and you don't need anything except a rice cooker, sushi vinegar and the rolling mat. The California-roll-style Temaki-zushi also look fairly tame. 

The Nigiri-Zushi made in sushi bars seem a little more complex. To make a simple Inari-Zushi you need tofu and there are extensive instructions for how to make the little packets or pouches for rice. These seem very interesting and I've tasted them before and definitely look forward to trying to make them. 

The idea of a Chirashi-Zushi rice bowl is interesting and does not require a great deal of artistic application. 

So, if you want to make a full sushi meal, it gets a little more complex, but you can try out various recipes and master the "dashi" which is like a fish stock/soup made with kombu and bonito flakes. This knowledge is of course needed to make the sushi rice, which leads me right back to needing a hangiri. I suppose you can use a glass bowl instead. 

This sushi kit is truly only a brief start to an artistic journey. Even after ordering this you may find you need a few more items before you can start taking steps in the direction of actually making sushi. 

I will report back as I try various recipes and all I can say is this will require an adventurous spirit and a few more Amazon orders. Once you have the Sushi book, things start to become more clear and you can make a list of things to order.

I bought this kit as a gift for my boyfriend's birthday and was impressed with the quality (and size) of the items.  I did a bit of research for the perfect "starter kit" and thought this to be a good choice.  It has the basic essentials, a descriptive and helpful instruction book, and a few extras.  He was quite impressed and had fun opening all the individually bubble wrapped items!  We can't wait to pick up some sushi grade fish and get started.  One item to note, I spent some time looking through the book that was included and feel that this will be a great help in the process... simple steps, good instructions, and great photos

I ordered 1 as a gift for my sister who was hosting Thanksgiving and one for myself for the house. The nuts were extremely fresh and tasty and I felt it was an incredible value. I have ordered nuts before through a catalog that werent as nice and more than double the price. I'm gonna order more for Christmas.

I have used this matcha daily for about 6 weeks now. It is very good for what I use it for. I make my own version of Starbucks Green Tea Frappuccino. (Once that drink name started to roll of my kids' tongues easily - I realized I was spending too much money on these drinks - and daily!)I am not familiar with various grades of matcha, but did not want something pre-sweetened or modified because I wanted to control the sugar, etc. I make my frappuccino like this: sorry - I do not measure - so you may have to modify these amounts because I am guessing!

1 1/2c milk
2 heaping spoonfuls (the spoon that's included) green tea powder
1/8c simple syrup (I make it myself and keep in fridge for week or so)
10+ice cubes (adjust to your taste - depends on size of cubes)

Blend this in a blender - longer than you think - pulse first then blend for a bit - I scrape down a bit bc the powder flies around a little and you don't want to lose any. (Simple syrup is 1c water, 1c sugar heated until sugar dissolves) It is much easier than it may sound - I make these daily in the morning. I hope this helps anyone else out there who is addicted to the GT Frappuccino - it is slightly different (I think they use a different gt powder and a honeydew syrup), but I liked mine MORE within the first week of having them!

Good stuff!  While this tea is not very tasty, it is:

1) very easy to prepare

2) very inexpensive

3) comes in a nice container

4) IT IS VERY GOOD FOR YOU!!

I have felt really good since drinking this 4-5 times a day and have lost a full pant size in just a few weeks!

So endure the bitter taste and be ENERGETIC and HEALTHY!!!

I suppose I'm unsophisticated about matcha teas since this is the first I've tried, but I really, really enjoy this matcha. It's smooth, mellow, and slightly sweet. I'm picky about loose green teas for steeping; some of those are bitter, & I DON'T like bitter tea. So my favorite teas are this matcha & white loose leaf teas. The cost is honestly too steep for me to buy other better rated matcha for the flavor, so I'm happy I can get this much tea for the price (I've got 3 kids & a lot of other priorities; maybe when I retire...). And for the price, I'm getting all the health benefits of any other matcha (you get all the antioxidants out of matcha since you ingest the whole leaf; brewing teas often makes the extracted antioxidants bitter), plus I don't feel too guilty using it on my face, either. Perfectly nice matcha for the beginner & the frugal. Gave some to my sister, also a novice to matcha, & she loved it too. Worth a try for the price

Teas vary greatly in quality and the price reflects that.  This is a moderately price matcha tea so don't except the best flavor.  It is nutritious so it may be better as a flavor additive to drinks, desserts, broth, etc.  Real matcha can also be bitter and an acquired taste.  Japanese often drink it with tiny sugar candies to offset the bitterness.  Matcha also contains a lot of antioxidants so it may be helpful to some to stat incorporating it into their diet.  If you don't like the taste an easy drink is to mix it with orange juice

I am a fan of Tasty Bite and think this meal is very good.  Not my favorite but very good.  (I'd give 4.5 stars if possible.)  The sauce is flavorful and there are plenty of veggies.  And it heats up so easily at work.  I love that these meals have no preservatives, plenty of fiber, no meat, and I can recognize all the ingrediants.  And, you get to eat the whole contents as one serving.  I love that

Recently having moved to the midwest, I longed for something different such as the wonderful Japanese food that was so readily available on the west coast.  I was so happy to come across Fugetso-Do on Amazon! I placed an order on Monday evening and by Thursday it had arrived! It was still cold, tasted very fresh and just delightful. Very soft..not rubbery as i have sometimes found in other vendors. Completely satisfied my craving. Would definitely order from again!!

I'm a fanatic for gummy candy, especially the sour kind. But most sour gummy worms look and taste like a chemistry experiment, and most apple and (especially) apricot fruit(ish) rings taste artificial too. Haribo does a much better job; their pink grapefuit was my favorite gummy until I discovered these apple ones. They taste natural, real healthy apple flavor, less stridently sour than grapefruit. Now it's a tie for top place: apple and grapefruit. When I can't decide, I eat 'em both together. My dentist taught me that trick, believe it or not. I sometimes wonder whose side she's on...

I really love this tea. It is my every morning tea. It has the very green (fresh)taste of the tea served in Japan that is distinctive of Japanese tea alone. For this reason it is not necessarily for those who prefer the taste of Chinese green tea, and there is a big difference between the two, because its flavor is definitely characteristic of Japanese green tea. The color is beautiful - almost as green as the twice as expensive Gyokuro variety. I have reordered this tea many times and expect to keep ordering it as long as the price remains close to its present price.

I agree with the other reviewer in terms of shipping, our basket arrived 2 weeks after ordering also. However, I have ordered other baskets from them and it only took a few days to arrive. Either way, the basket was well worth the wait. It has a large variety of items and they all taste great! If you can order ahead of time you won't go wrong with this basket.

It is an enjoyment just by opening the cover of the container! A delicate, fresh jasmine. A great delicious tea!

The tea is arrived in the container seen in the picture, with the tea sealed up in a little plastic bag inside of it. Make about 20-40 servings, depends on how strong you like it.

The green tea is excellent.  (and it should be considering the cost for such as small amount!)  I have to admit, I was shocked when I received the tiny little tin...the picture is deceiving.  You think you are getting a huge amount.  But you only need a small amount.  Very smooth. Overall, it is worth it. I highly recommend this tea if you're willing to dish out the cash

I got this as a recommendation from a friend and I found this to taste really wonderful. It comes in a cute small tin and a small measuring spoon. I enjoy drinking matcha teas in the late afternoon to help me relax and this is the best matcha I have tasted.

If you'd like to get wild, sometimes I like to sprinkle the matcha powder on top of some vanilla ice cream and it makes a great dessert treat

I love the bright green color. After I add hot water to the green tea powder, I whip it with a whisk, set it in the refrigerator to cool and the add a few drops of liquid Stevia to sweeten it a little. It looks a little strange, but has a good taste.

For those of us wanting to eat healthier and a little less "carbolicious", this pasta is really good.  It is difficult to tell the difference except this pasta has a bit more texture to it.  But hey, it's good, and to me, that's all that matters.  I stocked up.

When I first became obsessed with Indian cooking, I taught myself from books, and did everything by hand, including roasting and grinding my own spice blends from whole spices.  (If you want to teach yourself Indian cooking, check out my &quot;So You Want To...&quot; guide for helpful cookbooks.)  Since then, I have tried many pre-made spice blends, most of them lacking in flavor when compared to what I make myself.  And then I found Neera's Garam Masala on the shelf at the market, and discovered that this amazing product is as intense, lively and flavorful as the garam masala I used to spend HOURS making.  HOORAY!!  I was very happy to find it online at Amazon, because the markets I shop at do not carry specialty products consistently, so I was becoming frustrated when I couldn't find a new jar as my old jar was starting to look empty.  DOUBLE HOORAY!!  This is great stuff, and now I never have to be without. :

And this little gadget does the job much better than a Melitta style funnel and paper filter. If you grind your own you'll need to experiment a bit with how fine to grind and how tight to screw down the tamper, but after a few tries you should have the cup of coffee you want.

I have 4 now. They are pretty cool for serving coffee when you have company.  I don't think the online price is outrageous, but if you are lucky enough to live in a city with a Vietnamese market you can pick these up for $3 each

This is very good peanut brittle, I found no taste compromise even though it is sugar free.  In fact I found it superior to regular brands of peanut brittle I have eaten.  Most peanut brittle is hard as a rock, this brand had a perfect crisp crunch.

Man, when it's the end of the month and there is no food in the fridge, I like to cook up a hot pot of Ramen Noodles. I just boil those noodles and hook it up with canned pork, tuna, cheese, green beans, tomatoes, lima beans, or pig feet. The best way to eat Ramen noodles is to pour a lot of hot sauce on top of it. Mm! Mm! Good! A hot bowl of Ramen noodles on a cold rainy day at the end of the month makes me feel good inside. It feels you right up. My favorite flavors are Beef, Roasted Chicken, and Scrimp

The lovely thing about Ramen Noodles is that they take three minutes to cook and three minutes to eat and one doesn't usually find themselves wanting to vomit afterwards. They're dirt cheap and their convenience doesn't impede upon the taste, which is always a plus.

I have used only two bottles of this sauce over a period of years. I enjoy hot sauce on my food but this one can only be used on large quantities. I use it mostly with chili. One small drop,not dash,in a big bowl will have tears flowing from your eyes! If you like it hot! This is the sauce for you

We originally purchased this candy in Walt Disney World at the Japan pavilion.  When we returned home, the kids wanted more of it, but I couldn't find any around town.  I came to Amazon and here it was.  They were thrilled.  It has a good flavor and texture and they really enjoyed it

I started eating Quaker Oat Bran 2 years ago because I wanted a cereal that is high in fiber and protein, yet low in sugar. It is so good as a cereal with milk, and it stays crunchy. It also makes a fantastic trail mix with almonds and dried cranberries or other dried fruit. It reminds me a little of Chex cereal or Life cereal, but it is much healthier and substantial. I have not found any cereal I like better. Now my kids love it, too. I can't keep enough of it in the house. And I prefer this cereal to Quaker Oats Squares, which are made of larger squares

****
Tazo's Decaffeinated Chai Black Tea is an enjoyable chai experience for the most part. On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a rich blend of full-flavored naturally decaffeinated teas and exotic aromatic spices." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Decaffeinated Chai as "creamy, vanilla, sweet and pungent spices". Tazo describes the aroma as "sweet spice". Those are pretty accurate. The black tea "blend" is a little bitter, though, even with minimal brewing. It's a real trick to get it to brew long enough to get to experience the flavor from the spices without having the tea turn bitter.


The ingredients in Decaffeinated Chai are: naturally decaffeinated black teas, rooibos, cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, chicory, cloves, black pepper, natural flavors, and star anise. It is caffeine-free!

Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.

I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Decaffeinated Chai gets only four stars.

"Throughout India, chai wallahs can be found serving cups of decaffeinated chai to souls who naturally seek inner beauty at a slightly gentler pace." 

If you like your Chai with a peppery kick, then this tea will interest you. Rooibos, cinnamon, ginger, decaffeinated black tea, cardamom, ginger, chicory, cloves, star anise and other natural flavors seem to take a back seat to the delicious peppery flavor of this tea. This tea tastes similar to a tea I first tasted in Africa, where Rooibos tea is grown. 

Best served with milk/powdered milk/soy milk or a dash of cream and some honey. Since this is a decaffeinated tea, it is perfect for late night writing sessions or when you want something calming to drink that doesn't taste like chamomile.

However, during the day in the office this is the best substitute for the real thing.

This was the first Tasty Bite Entree product that I bought.  I though it was very good, and very authentic-tasting.  There is a lot of sauce, and you do need some rice or bread to sop up the sauce.  There was not a lot of paneer cheese in the first packet I tried, maybe three small pieces.  Still, it is an excellent product

It comes with everything you need (except the little bit of sugar you're supposed to add after the pearls are rinsed, but that's not a big deal - I just mentioned it for accuracy), the pearls are easy to fix and the instructions are easy to understand. The shaker is also quite sturdy, so it can be cleaned and used again.   :o

Unlike other oriental noodles you buy, this product has superb flavors and great noodle quality that does not break down. The vegetables taste like vegatables and there is NOT a lame aftertaste like some noodle packets bought in stores. Price is a little high, but you get what you pay for....Quality

We have purchased this ramen at a store that specializes in Asian food.  There are numerous varieties of ramen so you have to try many of them to find those that you think have the best flavor.

We were a bit apprehensive the first time we tried this ramen.  However, it has since become one of our favorites.  The spice is hot, but it adds a really good flavor to the noodles.  A real winner when you are in the mood for spicy food, or on a cold day.  Because this ramen is very hot, we have also mixed a package of this ramen with a package of chicken ramen to lower the chemical heat.  Even with such a mixture the soup is still fairly hot.

When I say hot, I mean spicy hot.  For many people medium hot is incredibly hot, but I can barely discern any spice in medium hot salsa.  I am accustomed to eating spicy Mexican food and Korean food, so when I say this soup is hot, you have a good reference

Thai tea is a wonderful exotic drink with deep flavors and vibrant overtones. Almost a dessert, but can quickly cool your month down after fiery Thai entrees. Pacificrim-gourmet also offers another brand of thai tea which is less expensive and yields more tea per package and some argue is more authentic.  Both are very good.  Ordering the products are easy and delivery was quick, and not as expensive as some other on-line vendors

We picked this up in Italy last February and brought it home with us. It's easy to use and makes great cappuccinos and lattes. We love how compact it is. It's also easy to keep on the stove or hide away in a cabinet. And of course we love the cow print. We get lots of compliments - both about the coffee and how it looks. There's no way I would trade it for one of those huge counter top machines

I love hot sauce.  I have been a big fan of other "insane" hot sauces, but the problem with them is that for the most part, they cannot be put directly on food, instead, they need to be diluted before they're okay for consumption.

Not this hot sauce.  It's perfectly hot enough, yet not too hot to eat straight out of the bottle.  I put it on everything:  Burger too blah with the normal condiments, El Yucateco can fix it!  Shrimp cocktail not kicking, El Yucateco will show those shrimp who's boss.  I even use it to bring salsas up to the proper level of heat.  

It's definitely hot.  If all you're used to is normal, red-colored vinegar water, this hot sauce will open your eyes and set your mouth on fire.  But, if you're looking for something with good flavor that'll keep you coming back for more, this is the stuff.

Sumac is a great spice, used all over the middle east.  Try it as the Persians do - sprinkled over steamed Basmati rice and grilled kababs.  Or for a Lebanese style breakfast, cook eggs sunny side up in olive oil and sprinkle with Sumac.  Perfect with some warm pita bread

These freeze dried strawberries are fabulous.  I use them in everything from cold cereal to oatmeal and even as an ice cream topping.  Most recently, I've chopped them up and added them to a batch of Rice Krispy treats (receiving rave reviews in the process!)  They're also great to snack on plain.  They have a light, crisp texture but they are not crunchy and they absorb moisture immediately.  Although 8 ounces doesn't sound like much, you really get a very generous quantity of these lighter-than-air strawberries.  I recommend this item highly

These are the best berries I've ever tasted!  I thought for sure they were sweetened, but they're not.  The berries they used must have been perfectly ripe and the flavor just blasts your mouth when you try them.  Additionally, the slices are whole, with very little breakage in the can.  The value you get is pretty great, considering that 8oz of berries is approximately equivalent to 5# of fresh strawberries.  At $3/lb (+ shipping) that's really not bad, and you can have these year-round, even when strawberries aren't in season

These strawberries are great.  They are great on cereal.  The price is fantastic.  My kids had some freeze dried berries at a "space center" but they were much more expensive.  These are a steal.  I am so happy to know where to get great freeze dried berries at a great price.

These were so delicious! They gave a great variety of cakes. When I say cakes, I mean in the sense that they're little asian rice balls filled with sweet bean paste, either mung bean or red bean. They're yummy and light. I didn't care for the strawberry/grape jelly cakes, they seemed like fillers, but the rest tasted good. Refridgerate thm after a day if you don't eat them immediately. They might dry out if you leave them in the box.

I too have placed an order (actually 3) with Ana Super on Jan 3 and did not receive my shipment.  If you go to their web site:  http://www.anasuper.com/  you will see that they are on vacation the first week of January and will resume shipments on January 10.

Initially, I was upset too that I had not received my order after paying overnight shipping fees.  However, given that they are on vacation, I will also update my review and provide information regarding my experience with them re: packaging, shipping, etc.


------------

I received an e-mail from AnaSuper and indeed, they were on vacation last week.  They said that they would send out my orders of wagashi today and they should be received tomorrow.  Hurray!

------------

The wagashi did arrive.  I had minor problems with 2 more orders coming through but the customer service did a thorough job tracking down what happened and now all orders have been completed.

The wagashi were very fresh and tasted great.  I sent some to my sister and to my student's mother as well.  My brother-in-law has eaten almost half the order already!

I would do business with Ana Super again

We were thrilled to find an online source for wagashi mochi desserts. We love Japanese desserts but because we don't live in New York or California we have a very hard time getting our hands on any. So when we found these we ordered right away. They arrived promptly and well packaged and tasted absolutely wonderful. Though a bit pricy after adding the speedy shipping they really were wonderful. It's not too hard to make plain old daifuku but when you crave the fancier stuff this is the way to go.

It is an acquired taste. When a friend offered me a piece I said sure and soon made a face she still laughs about. But it was an interesting sensation that was happening in my mouth. Salty, then sweet, then hot. I had to finish the piece even though I didn't care for it initially, because it was fascinating.

Then I decided to try another piece I was offered at a Mexican restaurant. I found that it tasted better to me and was still very interesting sensation. Now I bought a package of 4 pcs each time a special event in culinary weirdness and now I am a pulparindo addict. What came to mind was a scene in Star Trek the Next Generation when Data just got his new emotion chip and drank a nasty concoction. Guinan says,"How do you like it?' Data says, "It's revolting. May I have a another?

Regular Hershey's Kisses have always tasted great, but when I tried this flavor, it was an eye-opener.   The cherry flavor in the center makes me think of my Mom's favorite chocolate covered cherries of the 1950s.  Those were always considered too expensive and grown up for us kids to eat.  Now I can have cherry cordial kisses whenever I want.
Unfortunately they don't last long around my house. Treat yourself

  I personally LOVE crunchy cheetos, but if you look at the nutrition facts they're not really that healthy. I love the crunch and the cheesiness. Everything about cheetos are great, I even love to lick the cheese off of my fingers. Although the fat, salt, calorie, and carbohyrdrate content are EXTREMELY terrible, the package may say 100% real chese, but its 100% real FAKE cheese. It's like everyone loves chocolate, but it's unhealthy. 
  I don't advise you to buy these snacks when you can eat something healthier, perhaps a bag of low sodium pretzels or a piece of fruit. I think you should definintely eat cheetos at least once in a while because they taste delicious, just not all the time. I don't want to sound like a paranoid health inspector, I'm just giving you my personal opinion on this product! I &lt;3 CHEETOS

The cheese flavor is delictible.  But, don't fall for these wimpy ones.  Buy the huge puffed Cheetos.  Those are the best.  

Did you know that parents once raised a commotion about Chester the Cheetah?  They thought his cool attitude and love for Cheetos would encourage children to eat too many Cheetos and become obese.  I think this is a valid concern.  Maybe that is why we do not see too many Cheeto commericals anymore.

I might add that I find the orange dust to be enjoyable.  Finger licking good, indeed, don't be prissy.  I also enjoy the orange stains Cheetos leave on your fingers after the dust is gone.  Maybe you can convince your friends you are very artistic and just finger painted a masterpiece using just one shade of orange

I love Cheetos!

Did you have any idea you could review Cheetos on Amazon.com?  I admit I had no idea.  I typed it as a goof and up the page came.
But I stand by my 5 star review.

Full of yummy MSG.  Do you know how MSG works?  It dilates your taste buds so all the flavors seem more intense.  It actually has no taste of its own.  Did you know?

When my mother was pregnant with me, she would wake up in the middle of the night and ask my father to go out and buy cheetos.  I don't know why.  Maybe the salty goodness.

If cheetos cost as much as truffles, they would be a considered a delicacy and served at the finest restaurants.  I wonder if you can buy truffles on Amazon.com.  Shall we check?  See you there

C. Howard Company has been around since 1934, when Mr. Howard formed it in New York City to sell his violet mints. Actually, due to the quirky way he wrote his signs, it has been "Choward Violet Mints" ever since then!

Violets are very hard to describe. They have a wonderful, perfumed scent that makes you think that they will taste like some sort of chemical, but nothing can be further from the truth. These candies have a delicate taste that clears the mouth and freshens the breath.

When I was young, a local drug store carried a wide range of candies, including Violets (at least that's what I called them). Whenever I could I would go and buy a pack, and to this day the taste of Violets takes me back to my youth and that drug store with the giant racks of candy.

So, if you want a candy that tastes like NOTHING you've ever had before, then buy these candies. They are fantastic

I read this book from cover to cover and was fascinated by the information it provided both in scientific and in laymen terms. I started drinking Himalayan Goji Juice shortly after, in hopes of improving my poor night vision. The Himalayan Goji Juice is the only product that I'm aware of that has been standardized; like a fine bottle of wine, consistency and quality were key for me. 

For additional information visit: http://Research.GojiProject.com

1 month after taking this juice not only has my vision improved but my indigestion after meals has also begun to subside. I couldn't be happier. 

I would recommend this book without reservation to anyone looking for a natural alternative to improve their health

In my experiences with Indian cuisine from patronizing local restaurants owned and operated by native Indian folks, this is quite comparable and the flavors are very similar.  It's nice to be able to open a package of Indian food to eat with some Basmati rice quickly. Recommended.

Some of the flavors are spicy.

One of my favorites.  As good as it gets ... for what it is (prepackaged Indian food).  The flavor is authentic, and preparation is easy.  Best mixed with basmati rice.  I recommend adding chopped fresh coriander (cilantro). You might want to add a dollop of yogurt if you have a low tolerance for hot spice

I just made this soup for the first time, and it could not have been easier.  Add water, heat, and then garnish with a little cheese.  

I didn't find it terribly spicy hot. The chiles used are nice and mild.

A tasty dinner indeed

After years of nothing but Illy pods -- which are very good -- it was nice to branch out and try some other brands. The variety pack is a fun way to do that. I give it 5 stars because it is as advertised. The coffees are good - some are better than others, you'll find your favorites - and it is also nice to have a variety of decafs in the house. 

Illy is still a staple, though

I used to buy pods at Starbucks, but I started longing for something a little more authentic. Luckily, my fiancee bought me the PodMerchant Megasampler as a Christmas present. I was overwhelmed!

I never knew there were so many different kinds of espresso pods available, especially from one store. The selection in this sampler is huge, and it includes both caffeinated and decaf pods.  (There is also the Super Sampler but it doesn't include decaf, which is nice sometimes in the evening).

After trying these pods we found which espressos we liked best and have been buying those, but it all started with the Mega sampler. The shipping was also very fast.

If you're looking to expand your coffee horizons and have an espresso pod machine, you'll almost certainly find some new favorites in here

This is one of my favorite candy items, and one I think is well purchased by anyone with a sweet tooth, any gum lover, or any one looking for a taste of the orient. Three of the flavors in the package: Peach, Mixed Fruit, and Green Apple are in a `brick' form. They are about 1 in X  in and are very soft and easy to chew. The remaining four flavors: Orange, Strawberry, Grape, and Melon all come in small boxes that contain four gumballs each. 

Each flavor is powerful without being overpowering. They have a smooth, almost creamy texture when chewed, and blow nice big bubbles. Also, they're not overly sweet, or grainy with sugar. My teeth are often sensitive if gum is too sugary, yet these offer no obstacles, only mouth appeal. 

I highly recommend this gum!

I purchased this for an Oktoberfest party, there was a lot left over, mostly because people were slightly intimidated or mostly really drunk.  The sweet tasted nicely and were decorated in a very pretty way.  I'd recommend this to anyone who doesn't want to make their own marzipan and needs to purchase a large quantity.  There are several little "flats" of the candies so you can package them seperately or give a flat away to a friend easily enough

I make Thai curries occasionally, and the mortar and pestle I was using was tiny.  I would have to grind up all the spices in batches to avoid them from spilling out.  I finally broke down and looked for a larger set and found this one.  I debated between the 2 and 3 cup version, because I didn't have a good feel for how big they really were.  I ended up getting the 2 cup version, and I love it.  It is very large - plenty big enough for making a good size curry paste.  Its also very heavy, because, as advertised, is made of a solid chunk of granite.  It also looks great, attractive enough to leave out on the counter, and people constantly comment on it when visiting.  Mine doesn't look quite like the picture on amazon.  The outside of the bowl (mortar) and the top half of the pestle appear to be polished in the picture, which is not the case for the one I received.  Very heavy and solid - a great purchase.

If you like smashing things, this does the job nicely. I smiled taking it out of the box. It is quite heavy and large. Very nice open bowl with large capacity.

I highly recommend this as a workhorse. Warning: you may need a second smaller mortar if you pour/dump from your mortar often as this is very heavy. But this is very handy for working with larger items or quantities

That is my husbands' view; he's the one who eats habanero peppers like they're radishes!!- he love's this sauce; he adds it to his own salsa blends to make them hot enough to melt your tonsils... he has quite a following for his home-made sauces.  When he can't get fresh habeneros he uses Dave's to turn up the heat

Ok folks, this is not a joke.  I am a real fan of hot sauce, hot peppers and anything that makes my eyes water, and I have to honestly say that Dave's Insanity Sauce is absolutely the hottest thing I've ever tasted.  I use one drop in about 25 ounces of home-made tomato sauce and it makes the sauce noticibly hot.  This is NOT a sauce to dash into your soup or to liven up some salsa.  DON'T USE IT LIKE TABASCO!!!  It is a heavy-duty hot sauce that should be used as in ingredient when cooking a decent amount of a dish.  My brother doubted its powers so I poked the end of a toothpick into the sauce and gave it to him.  The poor guy freaked and ate more Italian bread than I've ever seen anyone eat in my life.  This bottle will last you a long time.  Why doesn't it get 5 stars?  It's just too hot

Hans Riegel was not only one of the most prominent manufacturer's of sweets, he introduced a product to the world that's far more addictive than crack or heroine.  These sweet little gummies are some of the tastiest bits of candy on the market.  Unfortunately they're addictive as well...my son foams at the mouth, begging for gummies at all hours.  At times this works to our advantage...bribery, a la the Scooby Snack. However, we know these are not the most nutritious snacks on the market.

Curse you Hans Riegel

This is very good roasted seaweed.  Excellent, in fact.  Most companies just dry their seaweed but let me tell you, they are lazy and really don't know seaweed.  See, that's the problem with most of the world today, laziness!  I can remember a time when companies and people cared about going the extra mile, when quality still mattered.  It's a shame.  Everyone is all about speed and convenience, speed and convenience.  It's like we're all on treadmills or really fast escalators or something quick and automated like that.  I just don't know what is wrong with everyone.  Sometimes I just have to sit down and shake my head. 

Roasting makes the seaweed almost taste like chicken and when you use it in your favourite recipes, you will think you've died and gone to heaven.  Yamamotoyama is the best!

Honestly, as a family who is gluten free, corn free, soy free, dairy free I've tried EVERYTHING on the market atleast once. This brand of pasta is the #1 choice in our household, and the number one choice of families I know who have kids who can't eat wheat. Unlike corn pastas and MOST brown rice pastas, this one never gets mushy. Skip the trials we went thru, just buy this one.

I LOVED THEM!  HARD TO LOCATE IN THE CAROLINAS.  I WISH I COULD HAVE BOUGHT A CASE.  I ADVISE EVERYONE TO TRY THEM -- SPLIT THEM AND PUT A MIXTURE OF WHIPPED CREAM CHEESE AND CRUSHED PINEAPPLE INSIDE FOR A FABULOUS FINGER FOOD FOR ANY OCCASSION!  THEY ARE SIMPLE DELIGHTFUL

This Matcha Green Tea Powder is delicious!  It does come slightly pre-sweetened, so people who do not wish to consume any sugar may need to be aware.  Also, sometimes the package has "Mo-cha" on the label, which is 'Chinese' for Green Tea (exactly the same as Matcha Green Tea).  I used this powder to make a Green Tea Smoothie Frappe and it tasted great.  Highly recommend

Celestial Seasonings has done all of us who experience fitful sleeping a great service by this offering. 

This tea is gentle, soothing, and an all natural way to end your day. I especially enjoy a cup of this tea sitting in front of the fireplace, wrapped in a warm blanket, and reading a good book. 

There is something about this tea that is comforting to the soul. A nice, warm cup is enough to help you feel comfortable in your own skin, and settle down to a restful slumber.

Highly recommended

Valerian and Chamomile are blended with spearmint leaves, lemon grass, hawthorn berries and orange blossoms to create a delicious tea to savor late at night before you drift off into dreams. 

This tea is much more effective than regular Sleepytime and I can say this because my sleep cycle has been fairly regular with much fewer nights of tossing and turning. You may also find that your mood the next day is rather mild and you feel more relaxed in general. This could be due to getting a good night's sleep for a change or it could be that the valerian has a lasting effect. 

Valerian is a very effective herb if you can't get to sleep and this tea is highly recommended for insomnia. Unlike sleeping pills, you won't feel groggy the next morning. Blend in a little lavender or orange blossom honey to enhance this deliciously mild minty tea.

We learned about agave nectar in San Francisco at Tres Agaves, a Mexican restaurant that makes the best margaritas we have ever had.  They use 100% reposado blue agave tequila with lime juice and with agave nectar to take the bite off.  When we got our bottle, we made margaritas that were also amazing and then began using it whenever we would normally use honey.  I especially like it for slightly sweetening a home made vinagerette.  Wonderful stuff

This was my dad's absolute favorite candy. He loved orange and bittersweet chocolate best of any flavors and this was, for him a match made in heaven. I adore it as well. After my dad passed away, I found a stash of them in his cupboard. They aren't easy to find, but they make a most welcome after-dinner sweet with coffee for guests.

The product description calls the Orangettes "Belgian Vitamin C."  Except for the luxury price, I'm sure Belgians must be pretty healthy with these around.  They're amazing!  The combination of orange peel and chocolate has long been popular, but Leonidas does it very well.  The dark chocolate is very rich, not bitter, and completely covers the orange peel (which retains a good flavor and isn't overly sweet).  Unlike other chocolatiers who often dip the peel only partially, Leonidas has made certain to put their chocolate center stage by using a generous portion.  The result is an addictive treat because the flavors linger on the palate and the Orangettes aren't so sweet as to become cloying.

I don't know if these guys are really going to improve your health, but they will definitely improve your day.  In my opinion, they're worth the money as an occasional purchase and certainly worth a one-time try.  

The packaging is a gold box, wrapped in blue and white Leonidas paper with a gilt deep purple box.  For shipping, the package was placed inside a sturdy styrofoam shell.  Mine arrived within three days and looked like I'd purchased them at the store to give as a gift

My diet requires that I eat less sugar so I'm constantly trying sugar free products. I've always loved the Jelly Belly brand and the sugar free beans are a great alternative. My favorite flavor by far is buttered popcorn and it tastes almost exactly the same as the orginal. The only thing is the outer shell is a bit harder than the traditional bean, but for someone who is picky it wasn't enough to bother me. It is lower in calories but watch what you eat because it still has carbohydrates just like anything else. I would recommend this product to anyone

This instant Thai tea did not taste like  the Thai tea I've had restaurants, but it was pretty good. I liked it hot rather than cold. It's pretty sweet. I decided to add a very small amount of Cinnamon to it and it came out great. A bit high on calories-180 calories per packet. I would buy it again

Authentic taste, long shelf life in your fridge, easy to use, and the price is right.  How can you go wrong.  When I prepare a curry with this I don't go crazy with a lot of Thai ingredients other than the curry paste.  Just some veggies from the super like bell pepper, scallions, carrots, jalapeno and serrano chilies, and some sliced pork or chicken or beef.  So easy and so delicious

My cousin-in-law is Thai and she cooked an amazing curry for us.  I had to have the recipe and she said it was really very simple.  Just get the green Mae Ploy curry paste, some Asian basil, and some coconut milk.  A little salt, sugar, chicken, some bamboo shoots and rice were the only other things I would need to make it.  Well, I couldn't believe it was really THAT simple, but it was!  The paste imparts several subtle and delicious flavors to the curry.  Tastes like you slaved for hours.  I never have leftovers when I make this curry.  The paste is so low priced I plan to stock up so I'll always have some on hand.  Plus-- no preservatives, no wierd ingredients.  It's all food stuffs, albiet some of the ingredients I don't recognize... what is a galangal?  Whatever it all is, sure tastes good

I'd don't know exactly how to write an in-depth review of anything, let alone a candybar, so I'll just describe what I think of it.

In my opinion, the Dark Chocolate Toblerone candy bar is my favore candy bar for simple reasons:

1. Dark chocolate is my favorite kind of chocolate
2. The honey that's added adds a subtle smoothness
3. The almond pieces aren't very big so the bar is mostly chocolate
4. Swiss chocolate is the best chocolate I've eveer had
5. There's no denying the packaging is really neat

What can I say, it's a candy bar

I ordered the gourmet sampler and am very pleased with both the freshness and taste! (My box had 3 ice packs to keep the bakery chilled, plus plenty of foam peanuts so there was no breakage or crushing.)

I had first tried a muffin from a local retailer, but wanted an idea of other Chatila products. Granted, when anything is sugar-free, it doesn't taste just like the "original". But the items I recieved were close enough that I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything. 

I follow a diet, for medical reasons, that is low in sugar and high in protein. These products balance both nutritionally without sacrificing taste.  My first bite of the chocolate donut (the first donu I've had in 20 months) was great. I can enjoy treats now that I thought I'd never be able to eat again

If you're from Brooklyn there's really only one chocolate syrup for your milk or egg creams. Fox's is THE cult favorite dating way back maybe even before trolley cars and the original TROLLEY DODGERS! No bona fide Brooklynite or ex-patriate, such as myself, would ever consider a substitute. Hershey be da----!This is the real deal; accept no substitutes. My only regret is the shipping cost from this purveyor. It's cheaper to get on a train and visit the nearest NYC Gristede's; and you get a day in Manhattan to boot! 5 stars plus for this wonderful, unbeatable product. Zero stars for the not to be believed cost to get it home. Demand it of your local super market manager.

   Finally - a company that cares about it's reputation and products!  I ordered these truffles and recieved them securely packaged and protected to ensure they arrived safely and as quickly as possible.  I am even planning a special dinner with friends entirely based around the truffles I ordered as I was so please with them.

  I also saw the other products this company carries - the attention to detail and the information provided on each and every product is outstanding - just like their quality (i.e.: Saffron).  I have found my gourmet source from now on!

if every seller was like JR mushrooms the world would be a much better place. They wont stop until there customer is completly satisfied. I ordered some winter black truffles from them and got my package lightning fast but came to find out that it wasnt what i ordered. I called JR and they said they sent better quality black truffles that cost more for the same price and this story doesnt end they even sent a jar of the original truffles i ordered just so i can taste the diffrence FOR FREE!!!!!!!!! Name another seller that would do that

my dad recently found out he was diabetic (and go figure, we are from milwaukee, wi too)...and he loves chocolate. this was my first of three birthday gifts for him. it came in a fabulous tin, and he said the entire house smelled of pure belgian chocolate, the minute he opened the tin. it tasted absolutely wonderful. and for $20...this is not a deal, this is a steal. sugar-free does not mean calorie or carb free, but he can still eat slices in moderation. he was very, very excited about this present. and i was very glad to make his day! wisconsin cheeseman shipped in like 2 days. i know all good cheese comes from wisconsin, but now i know quality bakery too! THANK YOU! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! he can't keep his hands off of it. heh

These are another neat taste experience from japan. The chocobabies, however, contain shellac as an ingredient, which kinda turned me off to them when I learned about it. The stars in this set are the strawberry-chocolate cone things, whatever they're called. They're delicious! Also, the coffee flavored ones are excellent. I'm finding I am a fan of just about anything made by Meiji, and this set is no exception

I bought both the 50 Flavor Gift Box and the Bean Blast Basket for corporate Christmas gifts. The Basket was much more expensive and didn't have nearly the wow value of this 50 Flavor Gift Box. It's shaped like a Monopoly game box and has the substantial feel of a real gift. It's also reasonably priced at around $15. Of course, the jelly beans are top notch and the unique flavors speak for themselves.

This is an excellent gift item or treat for yourself

Jelly Bellies are the gourmet version of the jelly bean. They are unique because of the variety of flavors and the ease with which you can recognize flavors. Even better, there are combinations of Jelly Bellies that can yield even more flavors. Jelly Bellies are small, but they are packed with a great flavor. 

Jelly Bellies are a special treat and while there are not an every day snack, I love to indulge upon occasion.  They are worth every penny each time I splurge to get them.

Enjoy!

I'm a huge fan of Jelly Belly jelly beans, so I really enjoyed this gift box of 50 different kinds!  My favorite is definitely tangerine - but it's always a treat to try new and different flavors.  This box comes with a guide that tells you which flavors are which, so you can avoid the ones you dislike (for me - peanut butter jelly beans.. gag!).  It's pretty good size with a decent amount of jelly beans for the price - Jelly Bellies have never been cheap!  It's well worth the cost though, and a GREAT gift this year for Christmas

Ramune is the Japanese version Lemonade, and it is a really nice drink, if you can get the glass ball to move away from the opening without spraying yourself with your drink. If you have been sprayed once too often, but love the taste, perhaps you should try this candy. 

I am pretty addicted to the stuff, and eat them 3 or 4 at a time. I enjoy just letting them sit in my mouth with that fizzy taste. They really taste quite a lot like ramune should. Sucking on some ramune candy is nice way to pass time reading, actually. They are quite refreshing.

These candies are not hard, and quite chewable for those who prefer that. 

For anyone looking for a candy that is not over-the-top sweet, give Ramune Soda Candy a shot. It is a nice candy and makes a great snack. Even the container looks like a ramune bottle

This is a great "linguisa"!  I usually buy mine from a store a few towns away because they have 'HOT' Chorizo Sausage but these have a really great flavor even though they are not 'hot'.  And they are organic.  The fat content is minimal when microwaving for a fast high protein snack yet it's high enough to use only the meat to coat the pan when adding it to scrambled eggs.  And the price is good too.  Free shipping and handling with a nominal purchase makes this a really good buy.  I highly recommend it

This is the story of two Tazo teas. I found that they almost need one another to produce a tea of exceptional quality. I tried each tea separately and finally blended them together. 

Tazo Lotus and Tazo Wild Sweet Orange make a wonderful lemony hot tea in the winter or enjoy being tossed about with ice cubes in the summer. The way I make this tea is by steeping two Lotus and two Wild Sweet Orange filterbags with 16 ounces of water. Then, you can add 2 tablespoons of orange blossom honey for hot tea and a bit more for ice tea. 

Drinking this blend is an aromatic experience. Lotus Decaffeinated Green tea is a blend of naturally decaffeinated green tea, natural lotus flower flavor and other natural flavors. Wild Sweet Orange is a blend of lemongrass, blackberry leaves, citric acid, rose hips, spearmint leaves, natural flavors, orange peel, safflowers, hibiscus flowers, rose petals, natural orange essence, ginger root and licorice root. 

I love the crinkly sound of the paper bags protecting the precious contents. The boxes are also quite intriguing and the stories on the tea packets are always mysterious and playful. 

A romantic tea with a golden-orange color. I can never decide if I like this best hot or cold, so I end up drinking it hot and cold. Half on ice and half in a mug. When this tea is hot, it is much more romantic and aromatic. When chilled it takes on a more bitter component. 

For something even more exotic, try the Tazo Green Ginger tea.

****
Tazo's Lotus Decaffeinated Green Tea is one of my favorite Tazo teas. The lotus flower flavor is pleasant and delightful. This tea is not bitter or harsh in any way. It is one of the most natural-tasting of the Tazo's I've tasted, very subtle, and much less artificial-tasting.

The ingredients in Lotus are: naturally decaffeinated green tea, natural lotus flower flavor and other natural flavors. Of course, this tea is caffeine-free.

Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.

On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "delightfully subtle green tea with the inner radiance and essence of lotus flower." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Lotus as "peach, nutty, flowery, overripe melon. This surprisingly full-flavored yet delicately floral blend is clean and light-bodied, with an aroma reminiscent of freesia." Tazo also describes the aroma as "tropical fruit, green tea". Hmmm...I don't taste all of these various flavors, and I suspect that Tazo really pushes the creative writing limit. I taste green tea, and a nice flowery flavor, which I'm assuming is the lotus, but not the rest---the peach, nuts, melon, freesia, tropical fruit---they're missing from what I can discern here.

I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Lotus gets only four stars.

I've seen that they are referred to as licorice with a cream filling.  They kinda have that texture, but not at all that flavor.  Much more like a fruit roll up with a sugary cream inside.  I like them

I agree w/ everything "Anon Y. Mouse" said about this candy! SOO good. So different. It tastes European in that it doesn't overload you with sugar. They are almost delicate and creamy while being slightly (slightly) fruit flavored! It is a nice change from American candy. I found these at a local coffee shop, and will definitely be purchasing them again!

I think I have overlooked Haribo for some reason, but this product is really good. Haribo is based from Germany, but sold in the US too..

Pico Balla is a unique candy, and they are small, so you don't have to commit to eating a king sized piece of candy :) Try these, they are very interesting

Pico-balla is a very subtle candy--and you will find yourself eating a large amount of it if you don't pay too much attention.  The different colors are each differently flavored, and you can eat this chewy treat slowly or quickly.  I like to bite off the outer layer first and then eat the inside, but my wife eats the inside part first.  Just a very different candy from what we are used to--it doesn't taste overly "sugary", won't feel like you are greasing your mouth with fructose, etc...give it a try.  I wish I had bought two boxes.  I wish Amazon offered the Balla-Balla, too.  I can't wait to try that sometime, but I would rather wait until I can get it at a good price.  Amazon's price is about 66% of the World Market price, and even less what online candy stores sell it for.  Take a chance on it.

I first picked this tea up in Paris at the Bon Marche department store food halls (Le Grand Epicerie de Paris).  On returning to the states and trying the tea I was most impressed.  Redolent of bergamot and flowers it has an intense aroma and flavor that is well-enhanced with the addition of honey and a little milk. It is now my favorite tea.  Enjoy

Besides being a very good deal for the price, this item thankfully does not contain lavender, which is not commonly used in French cuisine but is used rather to freshen clothes chests. However, the classic mix of herbes de Provence for cooking usually contains one additional herb: marjoram

I had been hearing about steel-cut oatmeal and the benefits of eating it for quite sometime now.  This is my first time ever trying this and I must say that I am extremely impressed. Now, I haven't tried any other brands, but I definitely would recommend this brand. I received my order rather quickly (within a week). The amount of oats I received for the price is amazing.  The 70oz can is huge. The great thing about this product you don't have to use a lot it at one to produce a sizeable meal.  I believe the suggested serving size is 1/4 of a cup uncooked. It may not look like a lot initially before cooking, but after it cooks it swells considerably. Oh yeah, get this... I am a type 2 diabetics and usually foods like foods such as rice, oatmeal and pasta cause my blood sugars to spike.  Thereafter I feel sluggish until my insulin kicks in to regulate my sugar levels (maybe I am telling too much of my personal business..lol). Not with this. I don't know what it is (maybe it's in my mind), but my body seem to process this differently. Try it

The product arrived on time and as advertised.  The oats were nearly as good as McCanns and quite a bit less expensive.  You just have to be careful not to overcook them as they get a little mushy if overdone

I got my order quickly despite the holiday rush. These oats are great, I'd use a bigger word to describe how awesome these oats are but I cant remember one. The texture is chewy and it induces prolonged satiety because youre forced to eat slow and savor the full oat flavor. Depending on your recipe and how much you eat, you should be satisfied for a long time after eating a bowl for breakfast. I wonder how the freshness will hold up after theyre opened though because unlike Mc Canns - this can uses a plastic lid with an oxygen absorption packet. We'll see. The price has come down so these oats are an even better buy. Buy Up.

How are these oats compared to Mc Canns

I've been a fan of Dave's sauces for quite awhile now and this product is no exception.  The initial bite into one of these olives is relatively painless.  And then the fun begins.  A slow burning sensation begins to take over until your mouth is wondering, "what did I just do?".  Want some more fun?  Offer some to friends and then stand back to watch the excitement.  While not as heat intensive as his Insanity Sauces, ranking only half-way up his thermometer scale, it's still got a little bit of punch to it with it's five different peppers.  Who would've though olives could be this much fun

We visited the south of France during the summer.  Spent time with our friends who live there.  They made us the most delicious dinner one evening.  Using these bricks...they rolled a ball of mozzarella in thyme, and then rolled a thin slice of prosciutto around the mozzarella ball/thyme.  Then rolled it up in a brick and baked them for about 15 minutes.  I was obsessed with finding these bricks.  I went to gourmet store after gourmet store here to no avail.  Finally, on Amazon, I found them!  Whew.  I didn't want to have to travel all the way back to France to get them!

Could use more flavor, but otherwise an acceptable piece of instant food. Just cook some rice and pour this on top of the hot rice and your all set. Its got all your protein and carb needs for a meal.

What do you think of foodwise when you go camping? well besides the case of beer, you have the dogs and the marshmallows! Nothing like roasting these suckers over an open fire, or just pop them in your mouth from the bad. Soft, and fluffy, these suckers don't get hard and stale as quickly as other brands do. Definately a great product

Hi there! My name is Frank, and Zaggy has allowed me to write and post a product review on his "About Me" area as a Christmas present. I don't care what everybody else says about Zaggy, he's a decent guy!

Today I'm going to review one of my favorite treats: Kraft Jet-Puffed marshmallows! Boy, do these take me back to those misspent days of my foolish youth. I remember those wonderful times when I'd grab a couple bags of these, and play a round or two of "Fat Rabbit" with a few of my visiting cousins. Now what is "Fat Rabbit" ("Chubby Bunny" in some locales), you say? It's a campfire game where you and at least one opponent take turns popping marshmallows into your mouth, one at a time (no chewing or swallowing allowed), trying to say the words "fat rabbit" after each new marshmallow tossed into your gub. The guy who is still able to pronounce "fat rabbit" with the most marshmallows stuffed in his/her cheeks is the winner. 

I usually beat out my less-than-capable opponents back in the day, but my victories came at a high price: my cheeks got stretched out so much, my jowls are now floppier than the ones my grandpa had when he passed away in the convalescent home a few years back. I probably shouldn't have challenged him to that game of "Fat Rabbit" during that last visit...

Bye

Out of all of the new flavors of Hershey Kisses hitting the shelves these days the Cherry Cordial flavor is by far the best! My daughter and I both agree. What a pleasant surprise to find them on Amazon! We were able to buy them in the store from before Christmas until Valentine's Day and then they just disappeared. How sad, but glad to see they can be bought online

I'm really picky when it comes to chocolate covered cherries - I don't care too much for the "dime store" variety - so, I wasn't sure what to expect when my mother handed me a Hershey Cherry Cordial Kiss to try.  But, from the first bite, I was hooked!  They taste exactly like the expensive brands I've come to love - and at a fraction of the price!

If you like chocolate covered cherries you just can't go wrong with this product!  These "kisses" are unbelievably good!!

The Red Sea Salt has a earthy flavor; it is slower to dissolve on the tongue.  It is a beautiful, unexpected hue, and surprised and delighted my dinner guests--none had ever tasted it before!  I used a light sprinkling on my endive salad (along with pepper) and it looked exotic and tasted amazing!

So here's the deal, I'm from Omaha, you can't go two miles without an Omaha Steaks Store.  Here we just call em steaks.  I can go to any butcher shop in Omaha and buy steaks that are just as good if not better than anything Omaha Steaks has to offer for considerably less.  This has always been my stance.  That is until I had these, these are quite simply the best steaks.  Yes, they're expensive, but if you're like my family and go out for steaks on birthday's you can actually save quite a bit by buying these instead.  You won't get a better steak in a restaurant, and my uncle's the head chef in a steak house, I could be stabbed just for saying that.  Cooked rare to medium rare you can literally cut them with your fork, they are more tender and have twice the flavor of any filet I've ever had.  I can't stress to you how good these are.  It's still the only steak I buy from Omaha Steaks, but when you come from the land of steaks that's saying a lot.  Sorry Texas, you may have more cows, but Nebraska Beef is simply better

In the midwest, some folks think of this as biscotti, but don't be confused. It is correctly named. It is a toast cookie, so when you dunk it be quick about it! My husbands favorite, and quite tasty, I like the small almond bits and that I can chew it without dunking (not at hard as their biscotti-See my review)

In my experiences with Indian cuisine from patronizing local restaurants owned and operated by native Indian folks, this is quite comparable and the flavors are very similar.  It's nice to be able to open a package of Indian food to eat with some Basmati rice quickly. Recommended.

Some of the flavors are spicy.

This is a delicious basic Thai yellow curry, with some vegetables. It comes with a little pouch of cooked rice to soak up the sauce and balance the meal, but I still found that with this meal, I really crave some chicken or some heartier addition like paneer cheese cubes, nuts, or eggplant. I don't have any Thai places in my area, so I add some chicken and pine nuts to round it out and it really helps that Thai craving. The sauce is delicious and the veggies are crisp

After growing up in Africa, one becomes rather fond of Rooibos tea and I never thought the day would arrive when I would recommend anything but a pure Rooibos tea. Tazo has taken Rooibos tea to a new level by blending African Rooibos (red bush) with hibiscus, lemon myrtle, lemon verbena, orange peel, rosemary, and lemon balm.

Rooibos has quite a distinctive fragrance that reminds me a bit of fragrant flowers waving in a warm afternoon breeze after an African veld fire. I remember mixing in a tablespoon of condensed milk as a child. Now I mix in powdered milk and honey. Honey seems to bring out the rich flavors in this particular tea blend. For some reason, this blend is rather delicious with a toasted and buttered cinnamon/raisin bagel. 

I've recently rediscovered the health benefits of Rooibos although I can truly say I've been drinking this tea for most of my existence on this planet. Rooibos is naturally sweet, very aromatic and is high in magnesium, calcium, iron and copper. Mothers in Africa will often add an infusion of this tea to a bottle of milk for babies to cure colic. An application of cold Rooibos tea can also aid in clearing the skin or is recommended for allergies, indigestion, insomnia and nervous tension. 

This is one of the Tazo teas that should not be steeped for too long because of all the delicate flavors. If you enjoy this tea, you might also want to try Tazo Honeybush tea. 

The Tazo company really has my attention with their packaging, amusing tales of ancient Tazo wheels and they know how to blend tea to absolute perfection.

Passion fruit concentrate has become my favorite "secret ingredient"...I use it to make a citrus sauce for halibut steaks (water, sugar, cracked black peppercorns, honey, lemon and orange juice and zest, and passion fruit concentrate)--serve the fish on a bed of arugula, pour the sauce over, garnish with julienne strips of cucumber and slivered almonds, serve alongside jasmine rice, and your guests will feel they've landed in Hawaii...I also add it to Italian Cream Cake, replacing a couple of tablespoons of liquid ingredients with concentrate, and add it to the buttercream frosting as well in place of milk.  I've used this approach to make everything from a three-layer cake decorated with orchids to bite-size mini-cupcakes dusted with orange sugar.  My husband puts it in martinis with pineapple, and I mix it with Hypnotiq for a gorgeous aqua cocktail.  Everyone always wants to know what that exotic flavor is, but I only reveal the secret to my best friends..

This is a superb product that used to be found on most grocery store shelves.  Sadly, they disappeared from the shelves.  After an extensive internet search for the product, I was able to find them through Amazon.com and Gristede's Supermarket.  I ordered a case and they arrived in perfect shape and just as advertised.  When these are gone, I will certainly use this same procedure to order more

My first and last beverage review.  I am gob smacked by this coffee.  What's that complex flavor?  I don't know but I've never had better and I've tried a lot of brands, gourmet and not so.  Smooth, nutty, winey, woodsy, whatever who cares I love it.  Maybe it's all that caffeine racing through my veins (I'm on my third cup) but I'm about ready to dance and break into song.  A polka would be nice.  Plus the fact that it's dedicated to a cat is extremely sweet.  And they practice social and environmental responsibility with their growers.  Way to go Seattle.

I have been faithfully buying Omaha Steaks products for years.  In MY grocer's freezer and MY butcher, there is nothing the compares to the taste and quality of these burgers.  You get what you pay for -- this company delivers consistent quality again and again.  

I think other reviewers of Omaha Steaks product don't know how to use their grill. If you follow the step-by-step instructions: PRESTO -- perfect taste every time

The vanilla beans arrived still moist, and plump. They're so much better in appearance than the kinds you can buy at Whole Foods or Wild Oats, which are very dry and shriveled by comparison, not to mention overpriced.

The fragrance is overpowering, and the shipment comes with a nice recipe for creme brulee.  Don't throw away your used vanilla pods!  Save them to flavor your sugar

First of all: WOW. Instant noodles for sale on Amazon? Second, excellent decision on selling Nongshim's Shin Ramen. Nongshim is the market leader in Korean instant noodles, which are epitomized by Shin Ramen's trademark spicyness and deliciosity. Not as filling as the non-cup version (which you have to cook over a stove), this small guy does pack a punch and will keep you satisfied - for three hours until you get hungry for more. Shin Ramen is second only to Sutah Ramen, in my opinion

Man, I've lived all over the world, and while most think that Ramen is a poor college student's meal is missing out.  After a few months of life in Korea, I couldn't get enough of the stuff.  I'm glad to see that it is finally being offered by Amazon.  I now can get a good book and some tasty spicy Ramen.  Life is good

Much better than some of the other coffee gift baskets!  I ordered a gift basket last year for my mom for Christmas that ended up being basically 2 cups worth of coffee and a few mugs - not worth the cost!  This basket contains a little more coffee, as well as some cocoa and cookies.  Ideally, I'd prefer to buy a basket that included a lot more actual coffee - but this one is way better than most I have ordered in the past!  It also comes in a very nice basket - which is great to re-use for making your own gift baskets, or for attractive storage

I hate to use this word, but this product truly is ORGASMIC. It comes out perfect, cup after cup, having a creamy yet zingy taste. The first time I tried it was at Einstein Bros. Bagels (the use the concentrate themselves to create &quot;their&quot; Chai Tea Latte). When I first tried this, I exclaimed to myself, &quot;WOW!!!!&quot;. Any person I have ever served this to was willing to vouch that their tastebuds were in sheer ecstasy.
 
 Mr. Oregon Chai Tea Latte Concentrate, THANK YOU

This sauce is medium heat for everyday use.  It has an excellent roasted pepper flavor, and there is *NO VINEGAR* to get in the way.  Consequently, you get exactly what one should expect from a pepper sauce...versatility and flavor that does not try to smother the character of the food you season with it.

An every-day sauce should not leave a patina on your tongue.  This is not a boutique novelty, it's a household staple.  The 32 oz. size is the right size for a hot sauce household.

You want good?  Try Tapatio on cottage cheese.  You'll never eat cottage cheese any other way again, I promise.

I use it on just about anything except cereal and ice cream, but my personal favorite applications of Tapatio are:

eggs
potatoes
pizza
anything creole (forget tabasco!)
cottage cheese
most rice
mac cheese
and of course...Mex

In my opinion, this is the best sauce in your local grocery store

I received the Fresh Roast Plus 8 as a 30th birthday present from my parents, which has allowed me to take my coffee snobbery to an entirely new level!  This model has worked admirably in the 2+ months I've had it, roasting one batch at least every two days.  It's not automatic (there isn't a good roaster that is) and you need to carefuly monitor color, aroma, and "cracks" to achieve a consistent roast, but the coffee it produces is balanced, consistent, and far and away better than anything you can buy in the store.

The negatives are that it does feel a mite flimsy:  the glass roasting chamber sits precariously on the fan unit and could easily be knocked off and broken.  Also, it only roasts a few ounces at a time -- perfect if you just want to roast enough for your morning cup, but don't expect to be able to roast half or entire pounds of coffee for gifts.  The smoke is pervasive, so it's helpful to roast the beans under your stovetop exhaust fan, lest you set off the smoke alarm.

Overall, this is an excellent product for the home roaster who's just getting into the world of coffee roasting.  Should the interest take hold a little more, it would be wise to upgrade to a larger capacity table-top drum roaster, or a used commercial machine

I saw the price of this and went WHAT??  Then I looked at the same recipe that I had downloaded from food network.  These became a bargain.  A pound plus of chocolate and a pound of good butter cost a lot more than this package and this gives the promise of almost-instant gratification without having to wash 10 dishes.  I mixed; I licked the spoon and bowl; I baked and went crazy just smelling them; I waited for them to cool; I picked off crumbs and "bits" that increased in size.  I cut off a small portion and gobbled it; I cut off a larger portion and ate it with ice cream; I went to the local bakery and bought dessert for my guests; I hid the brownies (never you mind where--the car trunk is a great spot); I went out and bought two more boxes.  Try them.  They really are the BEST brownies I have ever had and I have to admit to consuming a fair share of brownies in the last 40 years.  You will buy a second box, I promise.  Don't think of it as buying a brownie mix, think heaven in a blue box

The Easy Sprouter is a great vertical sprouter. The seeds or beans go into an inner cup with drainage holes. The inner cup sets in the outer cup which catches any dripping water and still allows air circulation around the inner cup on all sides. Maintaining your growing sprouts (for most seed types) means holding the inner cup under running water for at least thirty seconds, allowing excess water to drain off, and setting the inner cup back in the outer cup. Doing this two or three times a day makes sure that the growing sprouts remain fresh enough to avoid spoiling, moist enough not to dry out, but never remaining in standing water. Most seeds need to be pre-soaked initially, and this step can be managed directly in the Easy Sprouter. There are three lids: two lock into place - one with air holes, one without. The third is domed, but doesn't actually lock onto the cup.

By comparison, sprouting in canning jars requires the jar to be filled and emptied several times with each rinsing, and draining sufficiently is not always easy. The Sprout Master, which is another sprouting tray I love, allows similar rinsing, but the seeds must be soaked in a different container and then transfered to the Sprout Master. The Sprout Master allows the growing plants slightly more light because it has width rather than height, but the difference is slight.

I've mostly used my Easy Sprouter for leafy sprout salad mixes (alfalfa, clover, etc...) These varieties take about a week to grow. With the variety of lids the sprouter it is very flexible. I haven't tried to sprout while traveling, but I'm confident that it would work well. It works for storing your grown sprouts in the fridge as advertised, but I usually take them out of the sprouter and break up the clumps before serving and put any left-overs into a different container. I use my Easy Sprouter nearly constantly, along with my Sprout Master mini trays. I currently have a second Easy Sprouter on order

Bought to use in a cheesecake recipe that we've been enjoying for a year now using instant powder subsitutes...this is a reasonably-priced nice-sized sample to use. $5 shipping is a bit goofy for a soft 1-oz. packet of powder, but luckily I had a gift certificate. I look forward to trying different recipes with this. Cheesecake tastes good, a lot earthier/more organic now that we have the real matcha. I think I'll try making iced lattes now. Too bad it didn't come in the cute little round tin that they show it in...that was an appealing package but the resealable soft packet is nice too

I am gluten intolerent, or what ever you want to call it.  I get asthma from wheat flour, so I've spent the last 8 years searching for the perfect flour.  I've been using this for years now, I love this stuff.  I use it for cookies, cakes, crepes, pancakes, waffles*, madalines, yorkshire pudding, flouring meats for crispy frying, thickening soups and sauces, etc etc.  The only thing that it hasn't worked for is bisquits.  I think because this flour needs a binding agent, such as eggs or Xantham Gum.  With just the butter the dough after baking falls apart.  flakey and yummy, but a total mess!  
It also tastes kind of bitter raw, but once it's baked or cooked it's exactly the same flavor and texture as wheat flour.  

You can't go wrong with this alternative.  

Go forth confidently and experiment with all your favorite recipes using this wonderful flour!  

I love trying Martha Stewart's cookie recipes, this flour works perfectly for all I've tried.

*Some recipes may require a little extra leavening agent (baking soda or baking powder), such as waffles, madalines and pancakes.

Bakel's "Pettinice" rolled fondant, imported from New Zealand, is one of the favorite choices for pastry chefs (both amateur & professional) worldwide. It's available in white, ivory, or chocolate, and can be purchased in resealable 15 lb tubs or 5 lb packages.

Fondant can be flavored with small amounts of various flavoring compounds e.g. chocolate & pure extracts. Concentrated food coloring provides you with nearly a limitless spectrum of coloring options. 

The 15 lb. tub should retail around $44.99 (plus shipping), and the 5 lb. package should retail around $16.99 (plus shipping).

When I first tasted this herbal infusion it seemed I had tasted this flavor before when I lived in Africa. It is much more delicate than a Rooibos tea and has a golden rose color. When blended with a clover honey, it almost has a hint of lemon. 

The Honeybush is a plant that only grows in the high mountains of the Western and Eastern Cape regions of South Africa. I might have first tasted this tea when we visited Cape Town and went to Table Mountain. The plant is harvested during the flowering season. 

Honeybush is naturally sweet, caffeine free and has very little tannin. I still enjoy adding honey to this tea to enhance the natural honey flavor. This mineral rich infusion is rather soothing and can help to calm the nervous system. 

This is technically a wild mountain tea with a hint of aromatic flowers. I only wish I was drinking this tea while visiting Table Mountain. It gets rather chilly up there when you are overlooking the Atlantic Ocean.

Now, I'm all in favor of Hershey's kisses.  But you look at this guy, here, and you kind of have to wonder.  I mean, who buys 25 lbs of individually-packaged chocolate - Count Chocula on a bender?  Perennial Halloween door-answerers preparing for the Apocalypse?  Let's face it, this is the ultimate milk-chocolate-and-tinfoil experience.  I just hope you're ready for it

My husband, a non-celiac, eat this pancake mix (to make waffles) all the time.  The recipe calls for egg whites to be beaten until stiff, so it is a bit more work than many other mixes.  But, it is worth it!  The result tastes like *real* waffles.  Kinnikinnick mix also makes good tasting waffles, but the texture isn't as nice

This foie gras is some of the very best we have had.  My parents live in France and they know how we love foie gras, so they order some each year for our anniversary.  This selection is the best by far that we have had state-side.  I have to say that we had lots of foie gras on our visits to France and this stuff can compete!  It was mouth watering and a very generous portion size.  Plan to buy more

I just got my first tin today -- and I say &quot;first,&quot; because I know there will be many,  many more in my future! These cheese straws are just divine -- delicious, savory, great texture. You really feel like you're eating a batch of &quot;fully loaded&quot; premium cheese straws. Having started on the Atkins plan, I've been looking high and low for something that actually tastes good that satisfies that craving for a &quot;munchie.&quot; This has been a super find! (My other super find, also available on Amazon, is Ross chocolates...super-low-carb and amazingly delicious.) And I'm still trying to pick my jaw up from off the floor at the idea of these things being absolutely NO carb

I originally bought this small container of fleur de sel for a fish recipe I found that said it was "de rigeur", however I thought it was like any other salt simply grainier.  Of course, I only added a little bit of salt after I had grilled my fish and did not think it would add much to the dish.  Can you imagine my surprise when I tasted the fish, only to have a veritable bouquet of flavour explode in my mouth.  I must say that I'm never going to use commercial salt on my food anymore.  Now I understand why the great chefs of the past and present consider this the queen of all salts..

I am new to the world of gourmet salts--and this jar of flakey white granules has been in great demand in my house since we received a few weeks ago!  The granules are the size of the salt on a hot pretzel--but that is where the similiarities end.  The salt dissolves instantly on the tongue; it has no bitter or cloying aftertaste.  The jar suggests it be used  on grilled fish and salads, but I would reccomend it in lieu of table salt also.

I bought seven beans for seven dollars, and was a bit unimpressed with the aromatic quality. They didn't have that strong complex aroma right out of the bag that bourbon beans are known for. That is not to say that the inside of the bean isn't aromatic. After all, it's the guts that really count. Even though these beans don't seem to be as aromatic as other beans, this is still a KILLER DEAL!!! I recently purchased one bean from a popular brand "Spice Islands" for seven dollars. An unbelievably aromatic bean, but seven times the cost of these beans!?!?!? I think I'll just buy these and use twice as many as the higher quality beans. I'm still making away like a bandit

I bought these and the greatest thing besides the awesome price and the fabulous beans is that the VP or CEO or some such lovely gentleman actually emailed me and thanked me for my purchase and when I responded, followed up again with a nice response! How nice is that in this day and age! 

I used these beans in my home made eggnog this year and it was out of this world. I first scraped the bean and then threw the pod in and left it there till the nog was gone. (not long)

I also use one when I make my hot chocolate "syrup" (Lots of bittersweet chips, melted in milk and a little haff and half and the bean scraped and the pod - once again left in - I mske hot chocolate out of it by adding more milk to taste and a little bitty bit of brandy...decadent...oh my yes!)

This is a great buy, great beans, great company! Buy with assurance!

I can't say enough good things about JR Mushrooms. These are top-quality chef inspired vanilla beans. I got them primaraily for my creme brulee.

Another plus was the free shipping which really helps a struggling young chef like myself. The only slight dissappointment was that there was no "Best Creme Brulee" recipe enclosed. No problem for me as I've memorized the procedure.

I can say this: You won't be dissappointed by this product. Use it in whatever calls for vanilla, even ice cream

First off, the company sent me a HANDWRITTEN thank you note. When do you see that in the age of computer print outs. I thought it was an extra touch as far as customer service. I will be returning to this company again.
The flavor is OMG. My best friend is Hawaii so I often use the red Hawaiian salt, this BEATS its. It has a subtle but GREAT flavor. I will buy again

This package is a great way to try a few different types of candies. The choclate marbles are like m+ms, and the jellybeans are, well, jellybeans. The candy that makes this set stand out is the yogurt candy. It's the white one. I never knew it was supposed to be yogurt flavored, but it makes sense now...It's tangy and sweet and AWESOME! I buy these sets just for the yogurt candies when I go to the Asian market. They're grrrrrrrrrrrreat

When I buy produce, I expect the farmer to do all the work required to make the product palatable.  For tomatoes, removing the vine is key and must be done.  Amazon should reduce the price for all the time and effort the purchaser must spend on vine removal

Most fruits and vegetables begin to lose a large percentage of their nutritional value minutes after they are plucked from their respective vines or branches. There is a synergy of some compounds that have a very short half-life after being removed from their home plant. When the vine is still attached (and stilly green and healthy, not withered and brittle), nutrition from the plant is still being pumped into the tomato, keeping it firm, bright, crisp and yummy - and more nutritious

Sure, it's not 100% pure vanilla extract.  That's indicated quite clearly in the ingredients.  Molina vanilla is made with a mixture of pure vanilla extract and synthetic vanillin.  Personally I love its strong distinctive flavor, regardless of what percentage pure vanilla extract it is.  For those who feel it's too strong, use half the amount listed in the recipe.  I know a couple of people who do this when using Molina Vanilla.  Again, I like the flavor, so I use the full amount called for in the recipe.  This stuff has a great flavor that really kicks things up a notch

These crackers are absolutely delicious, whether you need to be eating gluten free or not...I can't get
enough of them.  My favorite flavors are the plain and the herb flavored. These crackers are thin and
crunchy and are just hard enough to be able to stick one in a jar of peanut butter and scoop a serving
onto the cracker. I love them alone. I love them with tuna fish. I've used them for dipping salsa and
guacamole but when I see them all disappearing quickly, I hope I haven't used up my last box.  Being
I AM gluten intolerant, this cracker has been a surprising lifesaver when I'm craving something crunchy
and flavorful

The only refined sugar in this brownie mix is in the chocolate chips; otherwise, it's naturally sweetened. And it's easier to put together than are the mundane supermarket brands: add one egg, butter or oil (or applesauce, if you're an oil-free person), and a little water. Throw it in a 350-degree oven for 20 minutes. That's it.

I'm an active home cook and a rather intense one (we make our own vanilla, roast our own coffee beans), so it's no surprise that I'd say the results aren't as good as homemade. But they are _very_ good. And I could put the mix together between innings while watching a baseball game. How's _that_ for easy?

I'll be making this mix again

I have been enjoying this mix for quite some time. It is a great gluten-free way to satisfy chocolate cravings.  Although the brownies can be a bit on the chewy side,I would highly recommend making the cookie recipe shown on the bag.  It makes really great chocolate cookies, definitely the best gluten-free ones that I have come across in a mix so far. I have even passed these off at holiday parties as regular chocolate cookies and my guests loved them.

Red Bull used to be my favorite drink, as I would not go 24 hours without drinking an entire can. That era has ended simply because I was beginning to get sick of paying over $2.00 for one can. I know several distributors who offer the product for $1.50, but I seldomly stock up on the stuff and end up paying the $2.00 for a can plus 8% tax, which comes out to $2.15 a can. Which is fine with me until you realize that you are spending over 700 dollars a year at this rate. It never stopped me before and I always felt that it was worth it, considering the drink helps me focus in college each morning. However, I recently noticed that on days when I was not in school and I drank a Red Bull, rather than being full of energy and ready to jog, I would become tired. I began to wonder why I would get tired after drinking a can of Red Bull. Maybe my inner body was saying, "stop drinking this **** every freaking day of your life!" Whatever the case is, I decided to stop buying it on a daily basis and just drink it when I have to wake up very early. Hopefully this can make it become effective on my body again, because I think I may have overdone it, considering I have probably consumed well over 1000 cans in my life. 

I personally enjoy drinking a cold can of Red Bull. Set aside the energy factor. While many people (actually everyone I know) says it is sick and makes them gag, I kinda like that cough droppy taste that is offered in a can of Red Bull. I find Red Bull to be a conversation starter for myself - kinda like smoker talk. I love to sip from my can of Red Bull and discuss the weather or some other exciting news with my peers. While I have tried so many other energy drinks, I can say that I do hate all of them. There has never been an energy drink that I enjoyed other than Red Bull. I guess I just like the Austrian people so much (and the fact that a can of Red Bull is vegan!) On the other hand, it is full of man-made chemicals that might do some weird things to me in the future - only time will tell

This is one of my favorite Tasty Bite entres. It is spicy hot, but not at all too hot, with a noticeable "curry" flavor. The addition of the cashews makes for a nice flavor note (although I could do without the whole chile pod). I take mine in a mug with a pat of butter floating on top for a just-before-bed stomach warmer, but you could easily pour it over rice for a quick, easy, and tasty lunch, far more nutritious than a bowl of instant noodles. By the way, the combination of pured greens and green peas is a terrific idea. I'd give this five stars if the peas weren't a little too redolent of the can. And, with the free shipping, this is a terrific price.

I love Indian food, but my son (7) is not always as keen on it as I am. We're vegetarian and tried other Tasty Bite dishes before, but none went well until I found Agra Peas and Jodhpur Lentils. My son wasn't sure about the green-ness, but after explaining it's just green peas with sauce and coaxing him to try it, he now ASKS for this all this time - really! I think these are a little milder in the "exotic" flavors and not as hot spicy. I suggest these as good choices for first time eaters of Indian food. And I love how easy it is to warm up.

Nicely seasoned, creamy texture.  Served over rice, one packet makes a generous meal for one, or would serve two with something on the side.

Cooked simply by boiling the packet in a pot of water until hot -- one of relatively few prepared food options where the microwave directions actually require more cleanup than the stovetop option.

Makes a good option for backpacking, too, assuming the weight is acceptable.  Requires no refrigeration and edible out of the packet with a spoon, cold if necessary

I am a diabetic and I can not eat regular pastas made from refined white flour. They boost my sugar up to high because of all the carbs. Dream fields  low carb pasta s has allow me to make and eat pasta again.
They also taste no different than regular pasta . This is a great product 
with great taste and low carbs

IN A NUTSHELL: FAST - IDIOT PROOF - MADE FOR ON THE GO - 5 CALORIES

This is really a very handy way to have a refreshing drink ready to go when water is just too bland, by itself.

Just open the packet, empty the contents into a bottle of water [how much H2O according to your taste] and shake it up. Viola -- refreshment in an instant. Or, you can put the bottle [plastic] in the freezer and have an ice-cold lemonade later.

WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT --

'Crystal Light On The Go Packets Lemonade, Drink Mix' tastes great, has very few calories, is an ideal carbonated beverage alternative and most of all --- IT'S EZ TO MAKE ON THE GO - FAST. It's also rather reasonably priced.

MY ONLY RESERVATION -- ASPARTAME

Some people do have bad reactions to aspartame but most people know, by now, whether or not it affects them adversely. I would rather have 'Splenda' as the sweetener, but maybe that will be available soon.

Through Kraft, there is a neat website which contains nutritional and other info about Crystal Light -  [http://www.kraftfoods.com/CRYSTALLIGHT/]

As someone who absolutely hates water, Crystal Light was a life saver for me.  Now that they make it in little packets 'to go,' I can put several in my purse when I go on business trips or vacation and feel good about buying bottled water.  I'm doing what doctors suggest we all do - drink lots of water - yet doing it with something that makes it taste good!

The only complaint I have - if you can call it a complaint - is that they haven't come out with Kiwi-Strawberry in the individual packets yet.  That is, by far, my favorite flavor.  Lemonade comes in a close second.

I highly recommend this product.

My Australian exchange student introduced these magnificant chocolate bars to me in January, and have loved them ever since!!! I don't know why they aren't sold in the USA, I've looked everywhere and have yet to find them! I bought some recently in Canada, and before that, relied on my Aussie exchange student to send them over. Crunchies are the BEST thing that has ever happened to the chocolate industry!!! The taste is undescribable, they melt in your mouth and are just SUPER SUPER GOOD! TRY ONE!

Okay... this is one of those foods that I never guessed that I'd be making so often.  As a college student, sure.  Maybe a box once and a while as a young married couple.  But as a new mom my motto was "my child won't be eating...".  [Actually you could fill in a number of items into that space.]

And yet, I find myself the purveyor of many, many meals that involve noodles and cheese.  Once in awhile these may be whole wheat organic noodles, but more often than not it is one of the few foods my stubborn toddler-now preschooler will eat:  Kraft Macaroni and Cheese.

Pros
--Lets face it the biggest pro is that testy tikes will eat it.  Let's call it "Tasty" then.
--The meal is quick and has 9 grams of protein per serving.
--It has no transfats unless YOU add them.
--Provides 10% of Adult Iron requirements-which translates as an even higher percentage for children.

Cons
--Cost a buck per box on Amazon.
--Since wheat flour is `processed' doesn't have a lot of fiber (1 gram).
--Processed flour probably means higher glycemic index (though that should be moderated by the addition of oil/butter and milk.
--Lots of sodium (740 mg).
--Lots of calories (380 prepared per  adult serving) which is not necessarily bad if you are trying to fill up a toddler.

Four Stars.  My greatest wish would be for an organic, whole wheat with flax Kraft Mac & Cheese, but until that day comes I am happy that Kraft makes a tasty, affordable, meal in a box that children will eat.  Just add veg and you are ready to go

I love these cookies, especially the chocolate chip.  They are great for a snack and can be quite addicting.  They are made from all-natural ingredients and whole wheat flour.  The cookies are crispy small animal shapes with a few chocolate chips, and not too sweet.  I do wish the cookies had more chocolate chips, but besides that, I can't get enough of these cookies

I'm a sucker for underdogs, the quiet achievers who never get their due. Sutah Ramen is overshadowed by the market dominance of Nongshim's Shin Ramen, but in my book, there is no equal. Sutah has (slightly) thicker noodles, more sophisticated spicyness, and a richer soup than Shin Ramen. While you can't go wrong with Shin (except for the massive dosage of MSGs found in all instant food, especially ramen), an spiritual experience awaits with Sutah

I have been buying this stuff since the wholesale club had opened in my town seven years ago.  I was horrified this past Thanksgiving to find out they no longer carried it.  I tried to improvise with garlic powder and Italian seasoning, but my homemade ravioli were not nearly as good as they had been in the past.  I can't say enough great things about this stuff.  I use it to season burgers, steak, to spread over chicken with a little olive oil before baking and grilling and in all of my stuffed pasta dishes.  It's not just great, it's AMAZING!!

The best experience for this tea is at the actual Pike Place Market where they brew it so you can sample it in their charming little store past the flying fish and florist.  It is also really great to have any other time in your life and to share with everyone you meet.  Since every grocery store doesn't stock this wonderful tea you will have to order it and stock your kitchen/office/cabin/whatever with it and enjoy

Speaking as someone who has to watch her carb intake carefully, I was not keen on trying yet another item that claimed to be low-carb and good-tasting.  So often the two do not go together, especially when dealing with the traditional, more "carby" foods such as pasta, bread, rice, etc.

Dreamfields is a happy exception.  This is not to say you can cook up a whole box and eat it all at once (those who have to watch carb intake will still need to do some portion control), but you can actually have a large scoop of delicious hot pasta alone or in your culinary creations and not blow your carb allowance.  And this is not some flimsy, dissolving, cardboard-tasting pasta; it cooks up hearty and substantial.  When you eat it, it fills up that "I am so hungry for carbs, I could eat a ton of potatoes" need.  Satisfying, delicious, filling, and easier on the insulin levels than regular pasta.  I love it!

I could not remember the name/source of our previous Petit Fours so I ordered them from Wisconsin Cheeseman because I had never had a problem with previous orders from this company.  The order was delivered on time.  These Petit Fours were more moist and flavorful than those from our previous source.  Everyone who received them as gifts commented on them.

New to Thai cuisine, I asked to try a milder curry, my tastes running to a maximum of medium heat. Yellow curry was recommended, and the coconut milk based Thai version was a treat with both seafood and chicken-something I've had occasion to order again and again.

So when trying to re-create the taste sensations above, I was less than thrilled at the idea of grinding individual spices, purchasing a number of pricey ingredients with limited shelf life and narrow applications.

I did some research and found that many Thai housewives rely on the time and labor savings of using high quality curry pastes as the basis for soups, curries and more. Mae Ploy was one of the brands repeatly mentioned as high quality and fresh tasting.

This brand comes in a handful of flavors and heat levels, with the Yellow Curry Paste being the first I was eager to try. It has a shelf life of 2 years, and the large plastic pouch also keeps very well nestled in its own colorful tub in the refrigerator.

The flavors of lemon grass, shallot, gingery galanga, kaffir lime peel, warm spices and red chili are very well balanced. This is the only Mae Ploy Curry paste without shrimp paste, making it vegan-suitable as well as delicious with shellfish, fish or fowl.

I like to snip off one corner of the clear packet, then squeeze out just the amount I need-anywhere from 1/2 teaspoon to 2 Tablespoons, depending on the recipe. This helps to maintain freshness and flavor and avoid waste.

For Thai curry, I will combine the Yellow Curry Paste with a small amount of chicken broth, then add 3/4 Cup more broth per person, plus a can of coconut milk to mellow and round the flavor. A cup or two of chunked seafood or chicken, plus cubed potatoes and onion-simmered together for about 30 minutes- makes a very satisfying dish to serve with either traditional sticky rice or more the more occidental long grain variety. 

Mae Ploy's Thai Yellow Curry is also delicious with just a bit added to your favorite dip, salad dressing, or try a teaspoonful combined with 1 cup of sour cream or plain yogurt 'painted' over your favorite fish fillets and baked just until cooked through, (about 15-20 minutes at 325).

The fine quality of this product has encouraged me to order another flavorful curry paste-also excellent-and I would highly recommend this product for those wishing to re-create favorite restaurant fare at a reasonal price, without tedious preparation

My boyfriend just found out the hard way that he has a wheat gluten allergy. I've tried experimenting with different non wheat fours, but they're expensive and don't turn out very well.  (And I'm a good cook!) He especially misses shortbread and butter cookies, so we were thrilled to see these in a local market!  They're a little different, but they're good! This is coming from someone who hates store bought cookies.  I'd pick these over most wheat flour cookies any day

I love Earthbound mini carrots.  They taste sweet and you don't find dried out pieces in bag like in some other companies.   I eat them out of the bag as a snack.   I boil these and mash them with potatoes and use the water in soups and various dishes.

On the downside mini carrots which are young carrots are abruptly pulled out of the ground by their hair.  The carrots' skin is then peeled off and stuffed in a plastic bag while still living.   Then they are eaten alive or boiled alive.   AND THE'RE BABIES!!!  Yes, little carrots are babies and we eat them.  It's cruel world if your a carrot

These taste like "real" carrots, and not the things that have been sprayed with who knows what and grown wherever.  I buy these all the time since they never seem to last long in our house.  They are particularly nice dipped in ranch dressing with bacon bits, and just have a sweeter flavor.  When kids are grabbing them all the time instead of cookies, well, then I guess that's all you can say!  Highly recommend

Tired of dulling your carrot-peeler?  These carrots are already peeled for you!  

Are normal carrots too big for you?  Well...these are mini-carrots, perfect for that mini-person that can't handle an entire carrot.

Sick of pesticide-tainted carrots?  These are organic.

What more could you want

My children really love these little carrots, and they eat them all the time.  In fact --true story-- we were at the park one day and I was handing out cookies and my daughter (then 4) turned to me and said, "Ahh, mom, don't you have any carrots".  [I thought the other moms would burst. ;-)]

Four stars.  Somewhat pricey but since my children eat them, I don't complain.  The ones we get here are sweet.  I love that they are organic, since carrots, like celery, can absorb alot of chemicals

I have been purchasing these mushrooms for years by driving to specialty stores in either NYC or Philadelphia.  Even including shipping, this is the best price I have ever seen on these mushrooms! I even received an e-mail telling me shipping may be delayed due to Hurricane Wilma, But still got the product in less than a week! I paid more than double this in a famous Philadelphia cheese shop, and the quality wasn't as good as this! I will definitely be doing more business with this company!

This product is great. Its much easier to get in Canada that's why I ordered it online since I am now living in the US.  However after the fact - I did find it available at Cost Plus World Market.  Next time I will pay attention to the volume of the product. The picture is not the right one. This Double size is really waay to much for my use.  I think I now have a lifetime supply.  
Using custard powder is way better in homemade nanaimo bars than using vanilla pudding mixes.

As a classic Seattle tea, this tea brings back memories of hiding away from the rainy weather sipping a delicious naturally sweet cinnamon citrus tea. When I drink this tea, I am home again. This tea has a unique personality that seems to embody the entire mood of Seattle in one cup. 

This is a delicious tea that should be brewed for at least 5 minutes to bring out all the flavors. You can sweeten this more if you like with Stevia or a natural sugar to enhance the natural sweetness. It is good with a touch of Muscovado Sugar from India Tree or the RIEME French vanilla syrup.

When I'm writing reviews and I get sleepy, this tea
wakes me up.

I'm just thrilled we can do it online, now.
Yeah, Market Spice! and Yeah, Amazon...for bringing it to us!

There are an awful lot of recipes for chili. Many winning recipes from the International Chili Society use Gebhardt's as a base. In my kitchen, it is an excellent start to a good bowl of red. I have used this chili mix several times and always end up with good chili.

This mix supplies no thickener, no salt, and no heat. These you must add yourself, which is a good thing; you can really customize to your liking. This my preference per pound of meat: 1 tablespoon of Gebhardt's, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne, and no thickener. I also find that this mix needs (per # of meat): 2 cloves of garlic, 1 teaspoon tomato paste, 1 teaspoon of cumin seed, 1 teaspoon of MEXICAN (not greek) oregano. 

I have always enjoyed chili made with this mix, and highly recommend it as a standard ingredient on your shelf. A fabulous way to prepare a whole pot of meat for those summer events.

Great unique flavor !!  Not hot at all.  I add my own peppers for the heat, but if you want great tasting chili, use Gebhardts.  I usually use an entire 3 oz. bottle of powder with every pot of chili I make.  My neighbors love when I give them my extras when I make my big pot of chili

I received one of these Bavaria Hams as a gift from a well-meaning, Glazed Ham loving, though non-cooking friend. So, being the nice person that I am, I invited he and some friends over for some Ham, Asparagus and a big pile of Yukon Gold Potato salad. And since it was hotter than blazes inside, I decided to heat the Ham and roast the asparagus and potatoes on the BBQ. 
I slathered the Ham with my secret BBQ sauce, placed it on the cooler side of the Grill and about 2 hours later we were all sitting down on the patio with a big, hot, delicious, BBQ'd Ham staring us in the face.
The French Rose' was poured, the Meal was consumed and a good time was had by all

The pouch is vacuum sealed and holds about 100gms of delicate, deep-emerald, leaves. I use about a tsp for a 12-16oz cup. It is very important to avoid using boiling water if you want to get the full benefits and flavor of this tea. Water at a rolling boil will overcook the tea and you will notice that the tea quickly turns brown in the cup. If you adhere to directions and use water at 80 deg. C., you will be left with a wonderful cup of GREEN tea that stays green. I absolutely love the fresh, grassy flavor of this tea and it is a wonderful pick-me-up. The first sip of this tea leaves a distinctly sweet note on the tongue even though there is no actual sugar in the tea! I have spent hundreds on different teas, but I keep returning to this one as my staple

I bought this at the local Asian market and was instantly mesmerized by its freshness, seaweedy taste, and subtle energy boost.  I couldn't get enough of it- I drank 6-8 cups a day for a month.  It's just a great complement to anything that you've eaten.  I bought the Sencha Special Grade from Upton Tea, thinking it must be better than this since it's twice as expensive, but the Yamamotoyama is a shade better for my taste.  I can never go back to tea bags, especially tasteless brands like Celestial Seasonings or Bigelows.  I don't mind some black tea bags, but not the fannings they use in green tea bags.  Green tea has got to be one of the best things in life

We are always thrilled with the quality of Stella D'Oro cookies. They do indeed deserve the "gold star." These are shortcake cookies, very rich, with a fudge center. They are quite sweet and great for a tea table or served with a cup of strong espresso. This is the kind of cookie to pull out for top-notch guests and for dainty occasions like neighbors over for coffee, tea parties and after dinner sweets

These have been my favorite cookies for over 20 years now, both in New York & California.  I just love the shortbread and the fudgy center and have never found another cookie that even compares.
Recently I moved to the Southeast, tho, and panicked when I couldn't find any Stella D'oro cookies anywhere! I'm so happy to find them here at Amazon, where I'm a regular shopper anyway; now I can add them to my order everytime I buy something!

These cookies are so addictive and there is no lack of fudge on them which that is a plus. Other brand of their "swiss fudge cookies" is not as perfect as they believe it is. The outside of the cookie does not blend well with the little bit of fudge they put on it.  Keep making this wonderful cookie and I hope the stores will stock them again

Stella D'ora fudge cookies were the best dessert I could find in my lunchbox growing up. Its crisp cookie with fudgie middle was perfect with milk or hot tea. Many times I would eat the cookie part and save the fudge center for last to test my patience because there was nothing like eating that chocolate. Stella D'ora was a brand common in NYC grocery stores (and throughout NJ), so everytime I would visit relatives there I would buy the breakfast cookies, annisettes, and the fudge cookies. I have seen the breadsticks in NC but nothing else so its so nice to find that Amazon has them.
 Stela D'ora always seemed so refined since they were Italian and for adults who liked a little treat with their coffee or cappucinos. My father used to dunk his cookies in coffee and they would become warm and gooey, while I preferred them crisp with milk. Either way, try a package of this and some other biscuits. They really are unbelievably good.

These cookies are amazing.  I challenge anyone to find a finer packaged cookie than Stella D'oro's Swiss Fudge Cookies.  They aren't overly sweet, but they are incredibly flavorful.  I don't think these are distributed in the Midwest/South (I've never seen them), so it's really great that Amazon has them for me to order!  Thanks!

Tasty Bite Punjab Eggplant is delicious and spicy.  Try adding a bit of plain yogurt.  Serve with rice or bread (nan or pita work well) and you have a brilliant meal that costs only a few dollars.  This is true of all of the Tasty Bite Indian Entrees.  I wish the Tasty Bite Thai Meals came as Entrees (i.e. without the rice or noodles) so I could streach them out into a big meal by adding my own rice or noodles.  
Tasty Bite Entrees are really easy to keep on hand, since they don't have to be refrigerated.  Buying in bulk works well for these.

A friend shared her MarketSpice tea with me years ago, and I was so pleased to run across an old brochure she had given me.  I ordered some, and that wonderful taste was still the same.  The teabags are so fresh and full of flavor that the oils in the tea cling to the clear bag they come in. It's a flavor you won't find anywhere else.  You can taste the orange and the cinnamon, and they're just a little sweet - you may not need to even sweeten yours!

The antioxidant properties of Goji Berries are ones you can feel immediately upon consuming them.  They're a legit superfood, however, the price is outrageous.  If you're comparing them with a dried snack fruit like raisins, they're 8x the cost (for organic). If paying $6 for an afternoon snack is up your alley, then there probably isn't a much better snack for you than these Goji berries.

My only beef with goji berries are that they are BONE dry.  So dry, in fact, they could hurt your teeth, if you have sensitive teeth.  I actually know someone who chipped a tooth on goji berries.  Soaking them is ideal, and then using the juice in smoothies, not to waste the antioxidants that washed off into the  water.

My boyfriend is a huge fan of duck.  He loves it.  Roast duck, Duck a L'Orange, chicken-fried duck, Duck Varsovia, braised duck, Duck Chow Mein, Duck-n-Dumplins, Duck in Claret, etc...  you get the idea.  Anyway, we were cuddling in bed one night and he said, "I picked up a tub of rendered duck fat from Amazon.com and it is really tasty stuff."  I said, "Oh yeah?"  And he said, "Yeah.  Let me get it and let you try it."  So, one thing led to another and we ended up using it, you know, intimately.  

Woooo! We'll never use K-Y again

I bought mine at Walmart a few years ago and haven't seen them since. These are SO fun, even to sit on the coffee table during the holidays when guests come over. You push down on the back of the reindeer and the tails lifts to let a bean drop out. It's a riot. They are small but hilarious and lots of fun! I recommend this for ANYone who has a sense of humor

I have given this gift three times, all three times to lonely old guys on the internet with no love life and bady body odor (I assume).
Each time they ate the jellybeans and enjoyed the way the beans fell from the reindeer's butt. I think it pleases bachelors and therefor pleases me

This is a great gift for that person in your family who still thinks fart jokes are funny or for ten year olds.  Only one problem.  Due to inconsistant sizes of jelly beans, the poor raindeer had a...dispensing problem on occaission which requires one to rip off the reindeer's head (thank goodness it's on a hinge) to alleviate the problem,  this could be traumatic to the more sensitive.. MERRY CHRISTMAS!!

I have to tell you, I have been a fan of spicy food for the last 20 years. I have tried wicked salsas, and crazy-hot sauces. I thought I had seen it all until I received Dave's Total Insanity as a gift last Christmas.

I arrived home from work and decided to give this sauce a try. We were having rice for dinner, and I launched a generous topping of Dave's Total Insanity into the mix, and dug in.

Oh, my! This stuff was no hot I had to throw out the whole dinner. I put way too much in. I never expected "nuclear meltdown." Friends, this stuff isn't child's play. Heck, I wouldn't even secretly put it in my enemy's food. I might get arrested.

Dave's Total Insanity has a great taste, and is perfect for the spicy food lover in your life, but don't go slathering it on your pile of chicken wings until you have a small taste first. You will waste a meal unless you use it in moderation

Johnny's is great for steaks, burgers, chicken....just about anything. Much better than Lowrey's seasoned salt

I use this -- for the most part -- instead of bread. I am Bi-Coastal and I keep these in the freezer both home in NYC and out West. I will have one or two a day and that is it for bread products. Two is 120 calories. You can use them to wrap anything you like. If you want some tensile strength just leave one on the counter for a while before using. This has cache. Who wouldn't want a crepe as a sort of ultimate gourmet taco? Not knockin' tacos or bread, but if you are a minimalist like me you want few things that are great. These take up no room. You can order them in bulk. Among my uses -- to wrap concoctions I create and make a meal. YYou do not neeed much of a concocktion. Max two tablespoonfuls. To put melted cheeze on and wrap up and make a meal. To put a spoonful of icecream on and wrap up and make a treat. To put a bit of preserves on and roll up for my equivalent of a treat. And you know what? When you do not need any, they are still there, taking up little room and available whenever you get the urge. Bread substitute? Well, everyone needs bread. I still go out for breakfast in NYC and will have a Bialy. But before I used to do three bialy's worth of bread a day. I have cut that by more than half. As far as I know this is the only product like this. I am well satisfied. Class act from California

Ume-En is one of the best brands of green tea powder I have ever tasted. This tea has a light, delicate flavor, with just a touch of sweetness, which serves to make drinking this beverage a delightful, relaxing and rejuvenating experience. With this drink, "tea time" is going to take on a whole new meaning. I would definitely recommend this product
