I am amazed what this program can do. It is a big difference from PS 5.5. It is a new learning curve but well worth it. What used to take me hours to do is now an action and done in 2 minutes. Amazon had the best price for me from a source I trust ordering from. It is worth it

I concur with the review that points up the problems with Adobe's new "license manager" method of activation. When you pay as much as you do for this app, or the entire suite, you should not be faced with complete lockup should you have hardware problems, or can't connect to the Internet from "location shooting." I took one star off for this egregious marketing tactic.

That said, this version of Photoshop is superb, an otherwise 5-star app. If you take the time to use the tutorials included in the help (used to be separate folders, with chapters 1 - 4 of the Classroom In A Book, but no more alas), or get one of Deke McClelland's fine tomes and do all the lessons, there is nothing in this app that the novice can't start to use from Day One. With today's point & shoot cameras packing more resolution, and more manual control, into their functions, use of Photoshop becomes more than just a hobby. You can really "rescue" photos that are too dark, too bright, exceedingly color-shifted, from the "cut" folder and still make prints. Further, the Camera RAW functionality allows anyone with a sufficiently functional digicam to touch up snapshots into fine photography.

A warning: you need the fastest processor you can afford (a Core Duo or Quatro will be superb), and as much RAM as your system can take. There is an optional performance plug-in which maximizes performance on systems with more than 1 Gigabyte of RAM. You need AT LEAST that much under Windows XP to get good performance out of PS CS2. If you can use 2GB or more dual-channel memory, that's even better (the dual-channel RAM adds a small boost when handling large file sizes, e.g. Camera RAW image sources). If you don't have these, don't expect Photoshop to act fast. 

Adobe Bridge is a major improvement for this version. It offers superior file and image management functions, and can even do batch editing on images. You can even perform Camera RAW adjustments right from Bridge. Bridge can perform batch processes WHILE YOU EDIT IN PHOTOSHOP. If that isn't cool, I don't know what is. If you doubt me, check out Deke McClelland's PHOTOSHOP CS2 ONE-ON-ONE tutorial for his chapter on using Adobe Bridge. His video introduction (included on a DVD in the book), and chapter on using and customizing Bridge, are terrific introductions.

If you're a user of versions 5.x (as I was), 6, or 7, upgrading to CS2 is a no-brainer. Don't wait. Get it now before the Adobe License Manager gets worse in 2007

Adobe Photoshop has a long history of being the best software in the business.  It's only downside is that it may seem a bit daunting to the beginning user.  There is, however, a plethora of texts, tutorials, learning guides, and even video's to help abate the learning curve

I was afraid at first not to order directly from Adobe but decided to take the cheaper route. It was obviously worth it - everything arrived perfectly - wrapped up, original CD set, etc.
Shipped in record time as well.

don't get me started on that latter program, argh
</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
Nobody, and I mean NObody, could be more of an Illustrator novice & ignoramus than I. Several months ago I was given a licensed copy of Illustrator 9 that a departing coworker had used. Wanting a chance to design the departmental logo that otherwise would've gone to an agency, I raised my figurative hand and volunteered blindly for duty. Having taught myself everything from MS-DOS to TurboCAD, to Photoshop Elements, not to mention Word, Excel, and Powerpoint (don't get me started on that latter program, argh), I figured I could tackle at least the basics of Illustrator 9. Loaded it on my laptop, took it home for a weekend....and just about lost my sanity -- and several fingernails -- trying to learn that confounding program. I managed to produce a few logos, one of which was chosen. But egads, what a big, stinky bear Illustrator 9 was to wrestle. 

When I saw that CS2 had this Live Trace feature, I pleaded with my workplace Santa to get it for me, and WOW! What an overall improvement!! 

Illustrator will still not be as intuitive to pick up as an MS Office product, but this comes darn close. With CS2, they've given us "hot tips" -- little clues about what some of the tools do, that pop up when you mouse over the tool. The intuitive menus are nice too. Also cool is that all the text & paragraph and fill & stroke features, which used to be huge boxes taking up valuable real estate on the screen, are now condensed up on a small horizontal toolbar, like in the Office products ... and when you mouse over them, the screen tips tell you how to expand them. Aaaahh! Finally some help for dunces like me. 

Live Trace and Live Paint are unbelieveably cool. The very first thing I did after loading CS2 was to grab a .jpg photo of a soccer ball off Google Images, and within 20 minutes, without consulting any book or online Help, I'd converted it into a simple graphic image painted into the 2 colors I wanted. 

But as for a great guidebook, the reviewer who suggested Illustrator Visual Quickstart guide by Elaine Weinmann was dead-on. I've bought several other "highly rated" books to try to help me through the confounding quagmire of Adobe products, so I've seen them all. The Visual Quickstart book doesn't have any of that insufferable "wanna-be-a-comic-novel-author" writing, and focuses just on the basics. And it's very literal, with step-by-step instructions. Still there's no substitute for the utterly excruciating process of learning Illustrator through experience. But the Weinmann book's better than any I've seen yet. 

The only reason I haven't given this product a 5 is because it still doesn't have the intuitiveness that it needs. In that way it's still "snobby" -- aimed at pros, not folks like me who need to do occasional design stuff but not for a living. But this is a far, far, far cry better than Illustrator 9. Absolutely worth the money, just for Live Trace and Live Paint alone.

If you're one of those people like me, who hang on to an older version of the application waiting for the right time, now is the time to upgrade.  You won't be disappointed.  Just ask the editors of both PC Magazine and C|Net which awarded this version their Editor's Choice Award.

Once again Adobe has listened to its loyal customer base.  The proof is in the new version of Illustrator.  Many of our requests were answered with the latest version including some that we didn't even think of.  I was happy to find out that even with the new features, Adobe has not altered Illustrator's previous palettes or keyboard commands.  There's nothing worse than having a shortcut or command memorized for years and then it gets changed with a new version.  No fear here!

First of all, I want to say that I am really impressed with the Live Trace and Live Paint features, especially when used together.   We all know that sometimes ideas hit us when we least expect it and are away from our beloved computer.  We end up drawing it out on a napkin, paper towel or the unused envelope from our glove compartment.  Normally, once you get back to your computer you have to try to redraw your graphic using Illustrator which takes both time and effort---not any more.

Take your napkin masterpiece to your scanner and scan it in.  Once the image has been scanned, then the fun begins.  Once the image has been scanned in and brought into Illustrator CS2, use the Live Trace feature to actually trace your drawing.  This feature actually turns to drawing into a Live Trace object for easy manipulation.  After applying some blurring as needed, your traced image is cleared up.  Then, convert your Live Trace object into a Live Paint object using the new Control Palette.  I like the Live Paint tool also because it reminds me of working in Photoshop.

Once you've converted to the Live Paint object, you can easily use the pen and other tools to modify any points to your liking.  Live Paint also has a feature called Gap Detector which can prevents paint from going over into other sections because of a break in a line.  This is a handy feature that keeps you from having to fix overspill later.  When the object outlines are finalized, use the Live Paint feature to easily fill any region with color.  Voila!  You are done.  Go from napkin to art in a matter of minutes.

A concern of many of us for years was the fact that while Illustrator keep getting better and newer features, it also mean more and more palettes.  Sometimes it became a little unmanageable.  However, the pros at Adobe recognized this problem and applied a solution - the Control palette.  This new palette sits at the top of the screen.  First, it acts as a an object inspector providing information.  Secondly, (and more importantly), the Control palette provides easy access to fill and stroke dropdown menus, brush shape, opacity, and style.  No longer do you have to fumble through your palette to get at these frequently used features.  If you are fans of Adobe's other Creative Suite 2 software, you will be pleased to learn that the Control Palette is apart of their new makeover too.

Here are some more new additions and changes to Illustrator:

*	Like Photoshop, Illustrator CS2 now supports custom workspaces.  You can display only the palettes you need at any time. You are also able to access or save any workspace at any time or use workspace templates.
*	Adobe has improved the Swatch and color integration.  Now, working with the other Creative Suite 2 programs is seamless.
*	Isolation Mode is a feature that allows you to double-click a group move and edit internal objects without having to search through the Layers Palette.
*	CS2 now supports all of the latest Wacom tablets. It now provides brush support for the new Wacom 6D Art Pen and adds a new dimension Illustrator's Calligraphic and Scatter brushes
*	Adobe Bridge integration is now a part of Illustrator CS2.  Bridge allows you to easily manage images through thumbnails for better workflow.
*	Macromedia Flash exports are now available.  You can export both text and objects as Flash files which result in smaller file size and easier incorporation into web projects.
*	You can now open Photoshop files with layer comps within Illustrator.  This new feature allows you to view many versions of a layout at one time, just as you do in Photoshop
*	Custom stroke placement is a new addition to Illustrator. You can now place strokes on the outside, inside or center of a path.
*	Underline and Strikethrough are two of over 170 new type enhancements.
*	These are a few of the new features!

The $169 upgrade cost is well worth the money, just for the Live Trace and Live Paint features alone.  However, you get so much more in the new Illustrator CS2.  Upgrade now and be completely satisfied.  If you haven't purchased a vector graphics program, get Illustrator, especially if you are already an owner of a version of Photoshop.  This new version of Illustrator even looks more like the familiar Photoshop layout.

I've been frustrated for quite some time now with having Adobe Reader and expecting it should do what Adobe Acrobat can do.  I was especially interested in creating PDF's (Portable Document Formats)of Word documents.  Although I have Photoshop that can do this for me in a roundabout way, I wasn't satisfied with the extra time it took to do so.  Faced with the assignment of pulling together a rather large family cookbook, aptly named, "Death by Cholesterol", I felt justified in finally purchasing not only "Acrobat" but also "OmniPage", an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software.  With these programs in hand it made the project fun to do.  Now I have the whole cookbook with its index as a sinle multi-page PDF file that can be read and also printed out by anyone I care to send it to over the Internet.  It's of great value to me now and gives me enhanced versatility even though I've only used a small part of its capabilities.  The reason that I've only given it a "4" rating?  I'm upset that I didn't get the full version, but I can't justify doing so.  I'm being petulant

I have been using Adobe Acrobat for a few years now.  I've used both their Professional and Standard versions.  Now, Adobe has released Acrobat 7.  In this review, I will be discussing primarily the features of the Standard edition.  However, these features are also available in the Professional edition.  Outside of the fact that the Professional version has more workgroup-oriented and enterprise features, these programs are the basically same.  I have noted any features available only in Professional in this review.  

First, what is PDF and what can it do for me?
Adobe's PDF is now a universal format that allows you to preserve the look and integrity of your original documents - Adobe PDF files look exactly like the original pages and fulfill requirements for electronic filing and document security.

Not only that, but you can share the files with anyone, whether on a PC or a Mac.  Each PDF file has the graphics and fonts imbedded into the file.  The user of  the file does not have to have the same font set, nor even purchase Adobe Acrobat, because the Reader version of Acrobat is free!

New Features in Acrobat 7
*	Turn MS Outlook email into searchable documents.  This is a great feature.  It allows you to effortlessly turn those old emails into the universal PDF format.  Acrobat's searching capabilities make even searching through the longest emails easy and accurate.
*	Attaching source files.  Previously, we have been able to create  PDFs from spreadsheet and other formats.  Now, not only can you do that, but this new feature allows you to attach the documents with the PDF!
*	Improved Browser.  Acrobat's browser has been improved to make searching for documents easier.  If you are familiar with the Adobe Photoshop browser, you'll like the new upgraded browser in Acrobat 7.
*	Searching improved.  The search feature has been improved when you are looking for files.  It is easier to search for files, because now Adobe has made the feature more friendly.  You can search by document and text properties on your local computer or across your companies LAN or WAN networked drives.

More About Acrobat
Although many people are familiar with the Acrobat Reader program, they are not as familiar with Acrobat itself.  I consult will many business persons and they are just astounded at what Acrobat 7 can actually do for their business.  Just the fact that you can collect and assemble output from different types of programs into on universal format floors them every time!  

Another great point about assembling the documents in Acrobat is the compression factor.  With Acrobat, users are able to compress the original documents, thus saving space and making it more efficient to transmit the documents via email or internet downloads.

This new version can now also create, and save "PDF/A" files for archiving and it allows users to  scan paper documents directly into a searchable PDF file saving space and time.  Many companies around the country are making the jump to the "paperless" environment.  Acrobat 7 can definitely help.

In fact, I know of an attorney's office making great use of Acrobat.  They have almost converted their entire office to a paperless organization by using Acrobat because of its form creation, reviewing, commenting, approval and signature features.  In paper document storage space alone, this office is saving thousands of dollars per year.  Even legal documents can be approved, digitally signed and verified in Acrobat.

Anyone concerned about the security of their documents has nothing to fear.  Acrobat's security features including the ability to create self-signed digital IDs are terrific; no matter if you have PDF documents loaded on your website for downloading to clients or if you are emailing the files.  For Professional users, Adobe has added a new feature called E-envelopes.  With the new E-Envelopes, user can package their PDF files in an encrypted wrapper and send those files securely via email.  For company networks, Adobe has also added support for your company-wide security policies using a new feature called Lifecycle Policy Service.  The granularity of the security allows the user to pick exactly what they will allow the recipient of the file to do like printing, copying, pasting and so on.  

Many people are also surprised that Acrobat isn't just for static documents.  Users can create interactive forms (Professional Only) as well.  In fact, I know a client who is an attorney.  They have almost converted their entire office to a paperless organization by using Acrobat because of its form creation, reviewing, commenting, approval and signature features.  In paper document storage space alone, this office is saving thousands of dollars per year.

For CAD and graphics professionals who work with 3D files, Acrobat 7 (Professional Only) can now convert these into PDF format for ease of viewing, whether in electronic or printed format.  This will allow the users to quickly send their clients views of the 3D object in the universal PDF format without the purchase of additional software for the recipient of the file.
Another feature is the new licensing capability that Adobe has added to Acrobat 7.  You can install the program and activate it on two separate computers, which is great if you work at home and at the office as well.  Need to install it on a third computer?  Not a problem.  The transfer activation feature allows you to transfer the license to another computer.  To do this, deactivate one copy and transfer the activation via a simple menu command. If your computers have internet access, the change happens right away.  This feature alone may save users money on purchasing multiple copies of the software.
Summary
I would highly recommend this product to anyone in business.  The easy of use and versatility of Adobe Acrobat 7 make it an indispensable tool,  whether you are a legal professional, an IT company, accounting firm, healthcare company or anyone else in business.
This is one investment where the ROI will definitely outweigh the purchase price of the software within weeks of normal use.  The ability to go paperless and save valuable office space that is now gobbled up by filing cabinets, paper binds and closets alone should make the difference for almost any company.
Testing Setup
To conduct tests of the software, the following hardware was used:
PC Compatible System (2 GHz Athlon Processor, 512 MB Ram, 30 GB HD)
Epson Scanner/Fax/Printer
HP LaserJet 8150DN Printer
For software tests (conversion to PDF format), the following software was used:
MS Office 2003 (Word, Excel, Outlook)
Photoshop CS

Its a great GPS once its starts and detects the satellites (sometimes it can take up to 5 mins). I used it with iGuidance and that software is the whole world of difference. I can actually hear what the direction are saying vs the software that came with the GPS unit (robotic sounds, need to subtitle that for me PLEASE!)

I used this program on a 5-state road trip of the Midwest, and while overall it was  "adequate," it had some key shortcomings.

The bad stuff:

First, this is not an especially user-friendly program; there is a steep learning curve to operate it with ease and predictability. Spend a LOT of time playing with this BEFORE using it as a primary navigator! A lot of the commands are not intuitive, and you need to go through a lot of menus to figure things out. This can be a problem when you are on the road looking to get somewhere. It doesn't have a lot of clickable buttons on the main screen. For example, to get the program to TALK to you, you must be on a certain tab at the bottom of the screen. If you are on any other of the many tabs, the program doesn't talk to you or show you the turns. It took me HOURS to figure this out! The help function was useless.

Second, the tracking can be very slow, and as a result you can easily overshoot your turns--especially when there are no physical street signs in many areas of the country--which happened to me numerous times. Many times the screen showed me I had a lot farther to go before the scheduled turn, and this caused me to overshoot it when there was no sign.

Third, the "rerouting" function is AWFUL and perhaps the biggest problem with this program: if you stray from the route--even to pull off and get gas--the program flips out and keeps trying to route you back to the original route even if that route is not the easiest or most direct. I have not found a way for it to manually or automatically calculate a new and different route. I also have found no way to modify a route once you begin the route (see below).

Several times in several different cities, the re-routing function was totally wrong--spitting out names of streets that weren't even on the screen at close zoom level. This is a really annoying glitch, and it happened without fail every time I strayed from the route. Once off route, there is no way to hush the program from yelling at you that you're off route, and there is also no way to easily have the program recalculate a CHANGE in the route. When there is construction that you didn't anticipate, for example, this program sucks at being able to change the route once you've started on it. Very annoying. There is no construction updater plug-in, which would be helpful for long term construction projects that go on forever. 

Fourth, the program does NOT audibly warn you if you are going the wrong way on a one way street. This actually happened to me, as there were no "one way" signs on a particular street in Springfield, IL. Though there were green arrows on the screen to indicate one-way, but the voice commands didn't warn me that I actually WAS going the wrong way, so had I not been looking at the screen, I wouldn't have known. You can't always look at the screen when driving. And in Iowa on I35, construction brought northbound drivers over to the southbound lanes. I was heading north in the southbound lanes (as I was supposed to) but there was no visual or audible indication that I was going the wrong way! Big time safety issue here.

Fifth, the search function is wholly lacking and is not easy to use. I needed to find a police station while in Missouri--no such luck. I also needed to find the state fairgrounds in Missouri (which I later came across on the screen) but it did not show up when I intentionally searched for it. Search limitations are the second biggest problem with this program.

Sixth, several times the screen showed me "off route" in a totally blacked-out area with no roads around me when I was in fact on a U.S. highway or interstate. Something wasn't communicating correctly. Other times the screen showed me more than 1000 feet off the highway even though I was certainly on the highway. In Illinois, the screen showed I was pretty much driving through corn fields even though I was on a U.S. Route. This problem is pronounced on multi-lane highways. If you're not in the center lane, often the program indicates you're off route. Very annoying.

Seventh, the zoom level does not stay constant; it fluctuates automatically between high zoom and far-out zoom. I wanted high zoom most of the time to see all the minor roads and landmark indicators, but the program kept zooming out and in every few minutes.

Eighth, the help function is a joke. It is totally lacking in substantive information. The program should come with a separate DVD movie showing how to use it.

Ninth, the program does not recognize a lot of road name synonyms. For example, some U.S. Routes also have county/state/local designation numbers and/or an alphabetic name, but the map often only listed one or two of the many "also known as" names/numbers. This can be quite problematic when the signs on the roads don't match up with the turn commands (e.g. "Turn left on U.S. route 40," when the only street signs showed an alphabetic name and no numbers. This was also quite annoying.

Tenth, the antenna that comes with the program SUCKS. Without fail, I would get a red "no signal" indicator in every city I was in where there were high-rise buildings. This happened in Kansas City, Des Moines, Indianapolis, and Springfield. If you are in a city, you risk having no GPS tracking ability. And yes, my antenna was mounted as recommended. At one point I held it up through my open sun roof with no success.

Eleventh, the main-screen buttons are way too small for use while driving if the laptop is on your passenger's seat. You pretty much have to pull over OR risk crashing to see what you're clicking on. Yes, I'm aware that the disclaimer for the program states you should have a separate navigator to operate the program while driving. I'm also aware that almost no one who uses this program actually has a navigator/operator.

Twelfth, trip planning is lacking. When you input a starting and ending point, the program gives you ONE route. There is no way to easily plan alternate routes or to preview them. True, you can do things like program it not to take you on toll roads, but this function is not easy to use. Several times the program kept me off the interstates when I wanted to be on them, and sometimes it kept my on the interstates when I wanted to be on U.S. or smaller county roads (for sightseeing purposes). I would have to go off route and listen to the program whine about being off route.

Thirteenth, I emailed a list of my concerns/constructive criticisms/recommendations to the folks at Delorme. Never heard back from them, which does concern me as a quality issue.

Ok, so there were some redeeming qualities:

First, *in general* the GPS tracker was on-target. For about 95% of my 2000-mile trip, I knew where I was and the program operated just fine. Just realize that this program (as well as GPS in general) has a lot of limitations, ESPECIALLY when there is bad weather or you are in a woodsy area or place with a lot of obstructions.

Third, you can easily add points of interest and comments yourself. I used this function a lot to mark places where I want to return to take photos in daylight.

Fourth, there is a selectable function to show high contrast colors (black background with bright road colors). This is quite helpful.

In summation, for the money this program is a good deal, but do NOT rely on it (or any GPS program) as your *sole* source of road information/navigation. If I hadn't had my Rand McNally paper road atlas and back-up state and city maps I borrowed from the library, I would have been in big trouble several times.

There are a LOT of ways this program can and should be improved, but in the meantime I'd still recommend it despite the problems. Knowing the limitations that I've listen can save you time and frustration. There is no better alternative IMHO for the price. It's possible that some of my complaints DO have fixes, but you wouldn't know it from the crappy help function.

This is my first experience with GPS.  This product makes using it a simple experience with on board instructions.  Viewing the screen on a Laptop as opposed to most of the Portable GPS units is a definite advantage to the user.  I would purchase another immediately if the need arose.

It took so long for this to come out...I hated the little hints they gave us hardcore NDers on the Dare to Play message board. I had extremely high hopes for this game--I adored Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon and waited AGES for this game.

Now, besides the absurd level of difficulty in this game [it was seemingly VERY hard in my eyes--I could not make it the first time through without the assistance of a walkthrough], I LOVED it. The flight to Paris and the travel about the city--it was also a LOT easier to make money in this game than in Secret of the Old Clock.

I did not like how hard the puzzles were, but all in all it was an amazing game. There was a lot of talking, and that can really slow down gameplay and frustrate a gamer. And puzzles like the darkroom, the paintbomb and the cookies were absurdly difficult. But otherwise it was worth it

These are a favorite in the home. Even though we have all of them, they   are each different and provide hours of entertainment. Skills are learned while solving puzzles some include spatial manipulation of puzzle pieces and roman numerals. Great source of fun and learning. Also a desire to read the actual book and see what is different and the same between book and game

I really enjoy the Nancy Drew games. They can be done as a senior detective with fewer helps or as a Junior detective with a check list of things that need to be done. The check list continues to update as you move through the game. I look forward to each new game as it comes out and can't leave the computer until they are done

Previously I owned ColorVision's Spyder2 program and was quite satisfied with it.  It did not include, however, a program for correcting the printer's color rendition. The new Spyder2Pro includes PrintFix Plus.  This along with the monitor correction Spyder2Pro works very effectively.  I am very happy with the program. For the price it is a great addition to Photoshop editing.  The Spyder program allows the monitor and printer to show a print that reflects what the user has taken in his digital camera. I have not found any particular negatives about the program.  In the past I have used their tech service for fine tuning the program.  They were very responsive and helpful.

I have read several reviews and decided the Spyder2Pro would be a good monitor color calibrator for me.   I have a Samsung 970P monitor with all adjustments via software.   The calibration process is very simple and all you have to do is follow the menu of questions during the calibration process.
I like the Spyder2Pro and would recommend it highly.

I am very happy with it but it doesn't live up to my expectations.
I also have the reg. Plus for XP and I really don't think the extra money is worth it.  If I were to do over I would still have bought the Plus superpack for XP but not the regular Plus just because I do have a Media Center PC. If I didn't have that the regular Plus for XP would have been just fine

This is an easy product to use.  It saves you when a disk drive fills up and you want to use the same partiction but need more space.  It will grab it from another hard drive.  It is also useful in setting up a D: drive for Documents, and and E: drive for programs.  It is useful to have windows on C: alone.  There are fewer crashes.

It has some nice upgrades from version 6.  It is quicker than the previous version. Highlighting text is a bit easier.   It caused a few problems with my officejet 5510xi and its ports, but I found a patch for the officejet and all is well.  It is a product that is helpful in my work

The new Adobe Acrobat has a cleaner look and feel, and is more user-friendly.  I especially apreciate the new quick distiller buttons in any Microsoft application, which allow you to create a PDF in one click rather than having to go to File and Print. Some functionality as before, with some new organization and better look/feel

I upgraded from Version 5. I don't use very many of the features. But the big difference I see is, files sizes seem to be greatly reduced. Something I would scan and be 10mb, now might be 2mb. This is just opinion, nothing scientific. The interface takes some getting used to, a bit different. Overall for the price ($99 - Less $20 Rebate), a great deal

I find that the new version 7 of Adobe Acrobat loads faster than version 5, both stand-alone and within my internet browser.  Also, the new version is better integrated with the browser and with Microsoft Office.  I believe Adobe heard and responded to the complaints about version 6.  There are many other features which I have yet to try but certainly look worthwhile.  Kudos for what I see as a substantial improvement.  I recommend

&#65279;Sandra; hope you get to read this before giving up on this great little program.
Check your printer drivers and spooler.  I'm as close to a computer guru as you'd want having
played with computers in general and PC's in particular since the heady early days of Sinclair,
Kildall, and Adam Osborne.  Installed Hallmark Card Studio on my beloved's machine several
years back.  Was immediately impressed with how thoughtfully programed for the beginner - my
lady took to it immediately - and yet how full featured it was for an advanced user (only wish
could import export data to other address books, and wouldn't it be great to have a Palm
conduit?!-)(I digress!-).
Every new version just gets better to the point 2004 has close to two gigs of cards and imagery.
In short, Sandra Hallmark Card Studio 2004 IS A KEEPER.

Now, approve of your using 98SE, I recommend to my students (yes I teach computing) not to go
beyond 98SE and certainly not to connect anything from MS to the InterNet beyond 98SE (little
thing code name of Palladium!-(
There can be problems with corrupting printer drivers and notably spool32.  Try removing your
printer under START &#62;SETTINGS &#62;PRINTERS, restart your computer with the printer on and
reinstall.  Hope this helps and you learn to enjoy this little gem of a program.  HB

This program is fantastic. It's super easy to use and has a calendar that will notify you of upcoming events/holidays/etc. There are loads of pre-made cards to choose from or you can edit them to your needs. You can also make your own card without any help. The same thing for envelopes! 

There are also quite a few additional projects included. You can create your own stationary sets (paper and envelopes), awards and certificates, kid's activity pages and more.

I highly recommend this program if you're a beginner card maker. I mostly bought this (I was a beginner) to save money on cards and in the 2 months I've had this program, it has more than paid for itself. It's much more convenient than going to the store, WAY cheaper and I really like being able to make matching envelopes.

I bought this package because my daughter needed to be able to do word processing and make presentations for school.  I used it because its what is being used at my office.  I wish they had included Frontpage instead of One Note (which I really haven't been able to find a use for).  Otherwise, it works the same as other MS Office packages I've used in the past

I have been running Windows XP SP2 and would "never" want to go back to Windows ME or Windows 98. With the XP, I rarely need to re-boot my system, and my PC no longer freezes up. There is a built-in Windows Firewall plus a pop-up blocker which are both awesome. The system is much safer, and I have NEVER had a virus, worm, or trojan horse while running the Windows XP Home with a good internet security/virus program.

One thing: Make sure you have at least 256 mb of space available in your PC before starting to download, as this does require at least that.

Get it! You won't be disappointed

I have been using Microsoft Operating Systems for a very long time, and, i still say that this is the best System out there, for many reasons.

An increasing amount of Linux and Mac users have made the claim that they are more compatible with programs, and are less vulnerable to virus and hacks.

In Response to Linux Users-
Stay away from Linux, Linux is free for a reason. It is compatible with very very few programs as it is, and that number will only decrease. For Gamers - Rarley do i see a Linux compatible game. Just stay away from this system.

For Mac Users-
Mac's also have a lesser amount of compatible programs. Fewer and Fewer programs can run on them, and like linux, that number will only decrease. The only thing keeping Macintosh alive is Itunes. Which is compatible with Windows. Besides, When Direct X 10 Comes out, it will only be available for Windows, making Macintosh's un-usable for new games when the next windows OS comes out (Microsoft Vista). The computers are also generally more expensive than Windows.  Btw - You can get viruses on Mac's

I have been running XP for a few days and so far so good. I was running win98se and decided to upgrade after microsoft announced that they no longer support win98. My software is now obsolete? Yikes! Well, I'm glad I upgraded.

Installation went smooth as silk and I have not experienced any problems at all. I had to find a couple of new drivers for hardware but that's been it. And for Home Edition versus Pro, I think I can be quite happy with the Home Edition.

I will say that win98se had been a headache for a long time so the stability that I see so far with XP Home is a relief.

Good features, good reliability. A very decent upgrade. I recommend it. Four stars

Simple. It loads like a blaze. Sure all the new frills and features like easy annotations are neat, but the speed of 7.0 alone makes it worth every dime. Especially if your current Acrobat is the half-baked clunky 6.0.x that burst through the gates before it had legs.

Honestly, I don't know how much more they can improve Adobe Acrobat.  It is an excellent product, and a god-send for electronic file management.

I upgraded from version 6.0.  The only problem I had with 6.0 is that it seemed terribly slow.

This new version seems much brisker.  It loads quickly, and files seem to "print" to it much more quickly than version 6.0.  I do not utilize the "one-button" feature it provides in MS Office and other programs.  I try to keep all my programs as non-integrated as possible, because my previous experiences showed that they really, really bog each other down, no matter how much their makers claim they won't.

I don't come close to using all the features of Acrobat, but for my needs, it far surpasses anything else I've tried (or researched).

If you're having problems with version 6.0, or have an older version that you just want upgraded, I strongly recommend this.  However, I don't foresee ever needing to upgrade Acrobat again

I have been using v.7 from the last week or so and i am very pleased with it. It loads very fast (unlike all other adobe versions), the conversion to PDF from doc or ppt files also is much quicker. 

I have not encountered any problems yet, but its only been 7 days since i am using it..

Definitely worth the upgrade

Version 6 seemed to go off the track by changing many users' favorite features, like form ordering along with how unattractive bookmarks had become. More than anything, version 7 increases one's ability to collaborate securely, providing complete control over your document, who can open, print, or even comment on it. But version 7 is more of a fix than a major upgrade, as it cures many of the ills of the previous version. Best of all, Adobe has kept the price the same. Very nice

First, if you're thinking about using these photos for print, you may wish to think again.  Most objects run between 300-600 pixels in width or height, or 1-2 inches at 300 DPI.  Stretch them bigger than that, and they'll start to blur and/or get jagged.

Also note, that if you try to export/save an image from the Hemera Image browser and select the 300 DPI setting, the browser may stretch the graphic larger than it's actual size, causing blurring and jaggedness right out of the gate.

You need to use the "Use Image's Full Size" checkbox when exporting images.  If you specify a 300 DPI size, and don't use that checkbox, you'll get a stretched image.  

For example, the first image in the collection (the pocket watch) is only 384 pixels wide. If you specify 300 DPI and don't check the "Use Image's Full Size" box, the software will stretch it to 642 pixels wide.  The stretching will cause the image to look fuzzier and/or more jagged when you use it in a web site or print project.

All that said, if you're going to use the images for the web, they're great.

You get almost all the images you'd find in their three "Photo Objects" collections, each of which is much more expensive than this single collection.  The difference is the Photo Objects collections offer about 20-30% higher resolution (i.e. the first image in the collection is 384 pixels wide, but is 492 pixels wide in Photo Objects) and you can save the Photo Objects images with transparent backgrounds (while this collection forces you to specify a color for the background).

For the price, this is a good collection.  There are lots of shots with minor variations, so it may seem like duplication, but for someone trying to get something just right, that slightly different tilt of the head may be just what the doctor ordered

Some other people have complain about the quality, if you're a print graphic artist then its problem.  As a web designer who need 2" by 2" graphics, this set is great.  You do get a variety of photos of objects.  For example, there's like 20 different examples of a live garnade, something like several hundred coins from different countries.  For $17 this is definitely worth the money.

I've found it is best to export the image to a graphic editor.  Then from there, make it transparent, resize it, and compress it to your wishes.  There's a fair amount of "People" graphic, but not as much as I'd like.  I don't have the 100K collection so don't know if there's any image overlapse between this and that collection.

Quality is pretty nice for small prints and great for web.  Especially superb for smaller projects like christmas cards and so forth, but not good if you want to print high resolution photographs on large paper.

For $17 this is the best collection I've ever bought, Photo Objects II is still in shipping, so can't compare quality with that collection yet.

OneCare is not a tweaker's friend. It has no knobs and gizmos for power users to tinker with. However, it does one thing right. It works. When you use it, you truly do have one care. Do what it tells you to make it green. If you can do that, your computer is safe from viruses, hackers, malware, spyware, known security vulnerabilities, low disk space, slow disk access, and data that is not backed up.
OneCare takes a layered approach to keep you and your data safe. It has an inbound firewall to keep bad stuff out of your computer. If bad stuff gets through the firewall, it has antivirus to stop it from affecting your system and an outbound firewall to keep it from spreading. If that doesn't stop the bad stuff, it makes sure you have a backup of your data on a separate drive or on CDs.
In the past, I haven't bought security products. There are plenty of free ones on the market that do a satisfactory job. However, ever since I tried OneCare as a beta tester, I fell in love with it. It is simple to use.
Reduce your worries about being online down to OneCare and try it today. You can even install it on other computers to help keep friends and family protected

Great SW, easy to learn, and good graphics.  Really helps visualize the space when you can see it 3D. 

Could be improved if numerous similar objects could be selected and changed simultaneously (e.g., windows, doors, cabinets to get all with the same materials, colors, & hardware rather than one at a time - very labor intensive).  Should warn users to select/create a style and then copy/paste them where needed.

Also, difficult (maybe impossible, because I haven't figured out how to do it) to change a room's/house's overall style once you start a given design

There are complaints about Win XP SP2 being too expensive or complaints about technical problems.

It is too expensive, but it is the standard at so many companies, big and small, around the world.

I just wanted to say that anyone who gives Windows XP SP2 a one star rating really doesn't understand much about the Windows operating system, and therefore you should not take into consideration their uneducated opinion about operating systems in general.

The price is a bit high, but Windows is what it is...  a dominant operating system

I do not why the others had these problems with Windows XP. I have run this program since it came out 2001? Except for the danger of attack by viruses, I have had no trouble as long as enough RAM is installed. A minimum of 500-750 is essential. With the addition of antivirus software and service pack 2, I feel fairly secure.

I ordered the box version from Amazon, instead of the download from the manufacturer not only because it was less expensive, but the main reason was so that I would have a paper manual. So many programs don't come with hard copy manuals and I prefer them over on-line help. 

As for the program itself, I trialed a download first. For me, the thing I fell in love with was the ability to call up multiple images, side by side, and compare them! It makes selecting the best image a breeze - a HUGE timesaver. You also have the ability to swiftly zoom in to check focus at full rez. Another wonderful thing is that putting the curser over one of the preview images, and sliding it, will slide all the open previews simultaneously, so you don't have to individually zoom and move each image. You can do this with up to 6 images at a time! You can also do a quick histogram check by hitting the "h" key, which makes it easy to toss off bad exposures at the same time as the review. While you've got the previews open you can hover the mouse over them and hit any # key to color-code the image. The colors can be keyed to whatever description you want. I do "1=green" for yes, "2=yellow" for maybe, and "3=red" for no. There's room for quite a few more colors after that. I then hit the sort key back in the main screen and quickly select all the red "no" images and delete them. After I have all my green "yes" images, I then review them 6 at a time to give them star ratings. I resort by rating and now all the best images are at the top of the page and I can start processing them. 

You can batch process file name, and some other things that I don't bother with, as well. It's got some nice keywording ability and you can easily sync the keywords with your Photoshop files. What's incredibly nice is that you can click on any word in the keyword list and all the images you own, with those keywords, are immediately shown in thumbnails! Finding an image is actually fun! It will even give you thumbnails of images you don't even store on your hard drive anymore! 

Fantastic program - I highly recommend it! The only reason I didn't 5 star it is b/c it's not all that intuitive. This is a read-the-manual kind of program, but you can do an awful lot with it without having to get too far in the book. ;)

I downloaded the demo of this program and although I am by no means a pro photographer I do have over 4,000 digital photographs of my family and I am taking new photos each day. In addition I post my photos on Pbase so family and friends can always see the latest photos.  I started looking into Digital Asset Management after I started to fall behind on updates of the Pbase photo website because of the time consuming process of managing my collection. In case you have not looked, there are products out there such as Idimager, Imatch, Extensis Porfolio, and many more. I downloaded demos of Imatch and Iview Media Pro and used each only briefly. Although Imatch costs only $49.00 or so and Iview costs about 3x more (around $160) I chose Iview because I felt the interface was just easier to use. Of course this says nothing about the features in each product and I am not attempting a feature by feature comparison because I don't have the time. I do think that Imatch is an excellent product and the few features I am looking for appeared to be available in both products. I recommend that anyone looking to purchase software attempt to download a demo first

This is an all around awesome product. I have had great experiences with the program, and use it very often as we use it to create our entire high school's yearbook. Anyone one who says it doesn't have the basics is pretty much lying to you, it has anything you'll ever need and more. The people who review this product poorly do so because they don't know how to use everything in it. 

The only problem I've ever had is learing everything you can do with it, otherwise it is perfect

Tighter Integration Now Possible with InDesign CS2

Adobe has totally re-done the interface to streamline it and make it cleaner from versions prior to CS.  If you are a QuarkXpress user, you'll find that in InDesign CS2, you get the feeling that it is laid out in a logical and easy-to-use manner.  The tools and tool palettes are where you'd expect them to be in the menu structure and on the screen.  Small touches like being able to save your workspace, like you can do in Photoshop CS2, are great.

I tested the integration between InDesign CS2 and some of its counterparts in the Adobe Creative Suite Premium.  I created different graphics in Photoshop CS2 and Illustrator CS2 and I found it was really easy to import them into InDesign CS2 and use.  You can effects like drop shadows and feathering to images directly in InDesign CS2.  No need to go to another program.  With the Control Palette you can also resize objects too.  This palette functions with Transform and Stroke features for graphics, and it includes paragraph, character and table features for text editing.  What the palette does is affected by the type of selection you have made - either graphic or text. 

I imported some formatted text in from Microsoft Word 2003 and two different tables in from Microsoft Excel 2003.  I was concerned how the tables would appear after the import from Microsoft Excel.  The tables imported easily. With InDesign CS2, you can now automatically style Microsoft Word files on import by mapping Word styles to InDesign CS2 styles as well.

An issue for a long time has been how to preview or view other types of files that you want to incorporate with InDesign CS2.  Now, Adobe "bridges" that gap.  Bridge now comes as a part of InDesign CS2 and the Premium Suite.  So, viewing any Adobe-type formatted file or standard graphic format is easy to do.  Using the same interface between the different programs is a help as well.  Adobe Bridge is a standalone program.

Being a Web Designer and using Adobe (formerly Macromedia) Dreamweaver 8, I was familiar with using Snippets.  These are portions of code you can save for use in other programs or you can export them to give to someone else.  Now,  InDesign CS2 offers this Snippet capability.  You can export objects as snippets. These objects can be shared or reused in other documents. Simply place or drag a snippet into a layout, and  InDesign re-creates the original objects, their formatting, and their relative positioning on the page.  No more wasted time redesigning, just to get something you have brought in from another document to fit.

InDesign CS2 also now has an Info palette that is just like those found in Photoshop and Illustrator.  Size dimensions and resolution are immediately available by selecting the graphic and simply glancing over to the Info palette.  This is a crucial tool when fitting graphics in a specifically space-limited area.  It's important to know the actual dimensions with which you are working.

Sometimes in designing and re-designing printed work, you have to move objects.  When this happens, your structure can often change in different ways.  InDesign CS2 helps you maintain your layout by allowing you to anchor your callouts, pull quotes, margin notes, and graphics to text. You can now precisely control the positioning of Anchored Objects, apply text wrap settings, and more.

As with other Adobe products, it is very easy to export your finished work in PDF format.  InDesign CS2 works so well at exporting to PDF, it even maintains the layers in Acrobat 7.  You can pre-define your Acrobat export settings as well.  InDesign CS2 also supports specialty PDF formats like PDF/X-1a and PDF/X-3, which are used in workflows.  It also supports high-resolution CMYK output and color-managed workflows.

If you are familiar with previous versions of InDesign, the upgrade to the new version is easy.  InDesign CS2 is even backwards compatible CS.  You will find that your learning curve is greatly decreased.

This is the easiest way I've ever been able to make CD's. It realy makes photo CD's easy and produces a great product. A group of frinds and Us just got back from Mexico and I put all of everyones photos in separate files on a CD. The automatic slide show goes through the differn't files as if they were just one file with no seperation, but the pictures are still separated in each person's file for ease when printing and so forth. It's great, wish I would have had this years ago

I have used this software from the very first as a PaintShop product and it still delivers. It has improved with this version. I reckon I have tried all other albums and quick editors but this remains the best. For more detailed work a more expansive editor is needed but that is not the purpose of this program. What it claims to do, it does well. If only it had some way of adjusting the mid tones. A simple histogram would make this a top ranking program

I liked everything about this product except it is a little too slow at times. I always shoot with Nikon RAW format. It has hung a couple of times and I had to kill it after waiting for 10-15 minutes.

Although not perfect, I've used Roxio CD/DVD 6 Platinum and Nero 6, and returned to using this product. This should also be called &quot;Burning CD's for Dummies&quot;, it is THAT easy to use. I've also used it to burn VCD's without a hitch. If all you want is a fast disk copier and compiler, this is for you

If you decide to buy a current greeting card program, there are really only two front-line choices: Art Explosion Greeting Card Factory (currently version 5) or Hallmark Card Studio (currently 2006). There are other programs available specifically for creating cards, but most of them are low quality and outdated, and aren't really worth considering. (A competitive third product featuring American Greetings designs is sadly now long outdated; the designs in the American Greetings program were of similar quality to those in the Hallmark package).

So how do these two products match up? Without a question, if you are looking for quality "canned" cards, the Hallmark program wins. The Hallmark designs are professional, and are equal in quality to cards you would purchase in a store. In contrast, the designs in Art Explosion are adequate but surely NOT up to the quality of a store-bought card. The Hallmark program is also able to simply and correctly print to several different types of card store (although you are stuck with the choices pre-programmed into the software unless you want much frustration). The Art Explosion does a poorer job of correctly and simply printing to a variety of card stock and configurations.

Art Explosion beats the Hallmark program in editing options (more extensive), and in the amount of additional art (clipart, etc.) included with the package.

If you do not plan to use the "canned" cards, then I would recommend Art Explosion. But the average user will likely appreciate the professional, high quality cards in the Hallmark package. Personally, I consider the choice of the Hallmark package over Art Explosion a no brainer. 

A note on versions: The publisher comes out with a new version of the Hallmark program every year (2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, etc.) and the same is true for Art Explosion Greeting Card Factory. Having used many of these versions, I find very little reason to recommend upgrading year by year. Disappointingly, the stock cards in the Hallmark program do not seem to have changed appreciably in many years, and the same is true for Art Explosion.

I had a very old version of Hallmark Studio, don't even remember how old.  Wanted to update.  I installed the program and was absolutely amazed and very happy with this product and features.  Lots of cards to choose from, very very pretty colors. The event planner is great too! The ONLY thing I would change is the ability change font in the planner, and move written info by tabbing.  Otherwise it's a wonderful program.  Highly recommended!!

This program is very easy to use and the projects are beautiful.

Installation is self explanatory. This also goes for the prepararation of cards ect.Detailed instructions apear at each step at the top of the window as the user moves his her mouse-pointer over various portions of the graphics.

 If you are looking for an easy to use program with great results, this is the one to get. With the cost of cards being what it is, this program will pay for itself very quickly. Relatives will like the fact that they are getting greetings which have been personalized. I recommend this  program highly

I'm not a Spider-Man fan.  I love POWERS, THE ULTIMATES, SUPREME POWER, PLANETARY and other stuff by Warren Ellis, Brian Michael Bendis, et.al.  So when I bought this, I wondered if spending a whopping $49 would be worth it.    

I wanted to read Straczynski's recent run of Spider-Man, but if I was going to spend about $20 on a graphic novel, why not spend a little more for the whole thing.  And that's just what you get.  In addition to getting Straczynski's 4-year run (which includes Spider-Man's evolution and discovery of his totemic powers), you get everything leading up to JUNE 2006 (which is just like 3 issues ago!).  And all on 1 DVD-ROM.  

True, the Cons are that when it comes to Crossovers, you only get the Amazing Spider-Man stories and reading it off your computer isn't as fun as reading the actual comics -- but that doesn't compare to getting the entire run.  It's like complaining about getting a free PS3, XBox360 AND Nintendo Wii, because the box didn't come with it or you're missing one controller.  

$50 may seem steep, but if comics cost $3 now, so for the price of like one or two months worth of comics -- or for 2 books, you get everything.  And it's true, you can just print out the pages if you want (so if you want to abuse your office or school's printer, go for it!

This set has got everything.  Almost every major Spider-man moment is in this collection.  From Spider-man's first appearance in Amazing Fantasy #15, his wedding, and not to forget those great super-villain battles with the Green Goblin and Venom.

Each issue is scanned in .pdf format.  It has all the original colors, ads, and fan mail printed.  They are all organized by year and it says they are all printable.  If you are looking for the entire Stan Lee and John Romita Sr.'s run, here it is.  It is great to see where Todd Mcfarlane, the creator of Spawn got his start on old webhead.   J. Michael Strackzynski, the writer of Babylon 5 also takes a crack at Spider-man's life.  

The collection covers the beginning from Amazing Fantasy #15 to Amazing Spiderman #531, which is around the start of Marvel's Civil War.

Instead of spending thousands of dollars on purchasing back issues, you can own this entire collection for around $40-$45.  If you have the ink, you can print out any issue to your heart's desire.

The only drawbacks are around the 80s when several spider-man books begin to crossover.  You only get a part of the story in Kraven's Last Hunt or Maximum Carnage.  One major moment of Spider-man's life is left out, where he fights Harry Osborn as Green Goblin. The conclusion of that story took place in The Spectacular Spider-man title.  That problem is going to fixed in the future as GIT Corp. has plans to release a complementary collection  dvd that includes The Spectacular Spider-man, Web of Spiderman, and Peter Parker:  Spider-man.  They say on the boards that it will be out by fall of next year, but you never know with this company.  I waited about six months for this dvd after it was delayed from its original release date from march.

Now that I have it, I cannot wait to dig into the mythos of the old webhead.  I recommend this to anyone who loves comics and loves Spider-man.

Be sure to look out for the Ultimate Spider-man collection and there are a few others like the Hulk, Daredevil, Iron Man, and Captain America collections that are due out next year

My dad got this for me to supplement a Latin textbook I have been studying for my high school language course. It is quick and easily understandable. You get plenty of words and phrases, which is perfect for a traveler. If you want to learn the language for the sake of knowing it, not travel, however, you'd better get a book to supplement this. It doesn't teach about pluralization, verb conjugation, or other oddities that the language holds, such as, in Latin, the ending -m which implies a direct object. The Latin CD also does not use the dashes over the vowels, which may or may not be necessary, I don't know. Overall, I am very happy with the product and with the price of $39.99 (USD), but I am also quite glad I have my textbook (ECCE ROMANI) to go with it

This is a great item for any collector or new fans to the X-men. All the older along with the newer issues look great. The CD includes all issues of the Uncanny X-men (1-461) along with Giant Sized and annual issues. There is also comprehensive biographies on the more popular characters and artwork and layouts of the Xaiver Institute. Could it of had more content, maybe, but this will keep one busy for a long time. With easy maneuverabiltity, this is a highly addictive CD with virtually months of entertainment

Nice collection of the complete issues, though, of course, one knows going in that the later Marvel practice of storylines that run through all the books makes the stories provided only a small slice of the full story, which is somewhat frustrating.  

And the earliest years are, of course, somewhat crude (heretically, even the Kirby artwork in the first year is).

But very nice to have in an affordable edition, regardless of the flaws (though best viewed with a large monitor

All I have to say is 485 comics for 40 dollars.  Or about 40 years worth.  That's like a dollar a year.  You do the math...it's an amazing deal.  Also, quality is great and you can print them if you want

I loved the X-Men cartoon in the 90s and Fox, and always liked reading the graphic novels in Barnes and Noble and the like.  However, I just never had the time or money to get into it like I wanted.  This collection is a great way for us beginnings to understand the depth of the mythology and see the transformation of the series over the years.  Reading the first 60 issues was a trip -- seeing how the characters were developed, both the art and their literary personality.  

If you're interested in the X-Men, whether from the new movies or just from being a kid at heart -- for 40 bucks you can know it all. (almost)

While I love the content and the overall idea, it seems they seriously skimped on the packaging. All you get, outside of the outer box, is a cd in a paper envelope. No jewel case, book, insert, etc.......perhaps it's on the cd

don't get me started on that latter program, argh
</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
Nobody, and I mean NObody, could be more of an Illustrator novice & ignoramus than I.  Several months ago I was given a licensed copy of Illustrator 9 that a departing coworker had used.  Wanting a chance to design the departmental logo that otherwise would've gone to an agency, I raised my figurative hand and volunteered for duty.  Having taught myself everything from MS-DOS to TurboCAD, to Photoshop Elements, not to mention Word, Excel, and Powerpoint (don't get me started on that latter program, argh), I figured I could tackle at least the basics of Illustrator 9.  Loaded it on my laptop, took it home for a weekend....and just about lost my sanity -- and several fingernails -- trying to learn that confounding program.  I managed to produce a few logos, one of which was chosen.  But egads, what a big, stinky bear Illustrator 9 was to wrestle.

When I saw that CS2 had this Live Trace feature, I pleaded with my workplace Santa to get it for me, and WOW!  What an overall improvement!!

Illustrator will still not be as intuitive to pick up as an MS Office product, but this comes darn close.  With CS2, they've given us "hot tips" -- little clues about what some of the tools do, that pop up when you mouse over the tool.  The intuitive menus are nice too.  Also cool is that all the text & paragraph and fill & stroke features, which used to be huge boxes taking up valuable real estate on the screen, are now condensed up on a small horizontal toolbar, like in the Office products ... and when you mouse over them, the screen tips tell you how to expand them.  Aaaahh!  Finally some help for dunces like me.

Live Trace and Live Paint are unbelieveably cool.  The very first thing I did after loading CS2 was to grab a .jpg photo of a soccer ball off Google Images, and within 20 minutes, without consulting any book or online Help, I'd converted it into a simple graphic image painted into the 2 colors I wanted.

But as for a great guidebook, the reviewer who suggested Illustrator Visual Quickstart guide by Elaine Weinmann was dead-on.  I've bought several other "highly rated" books to try to help me through the quagmire of Adobe products, so I've seen them all.  The Visual Quickstart book doesn't have any of that insufferable "wanna-be-a-comic-novel-author" writing, and focuses just on the basics.  And it's very literal, with step-by-step instructions.  Still there's no substitute for the utterly excruciating process of learning Illustrator through experience.  But the Weinmann book's better than any I've seen yet.

The only reason I haven't given this product a 5 is because it still doesn't have the intuitiveness that it needs.  In that way it's still "snobby" -- aimed at pros, not folks like me who need to do occasional stuff but not for a living.  But this is a far, far, far cry better than Illustrator 9.  Absolutely worth the money, just for Live Trace and Live Paint alone

I was waiting for CS2 after using the CS. There are too many problems in CS. And I am very happy with CS2 now. The software is a lot easier to use, less problems. I have been using illustrator since illustrator 4. CS2 is definitly better than ever!

Not bad, however, in Version 10, was able to use CNTRL + to zoom in.  Used the + on the number pad -- now this function doesn't work, and the only + that works is that in the top row of the keyboard.  The zoom out "-" in the number pad still works, but not the plus.  I say that's not good.

Why ruin things with an upgrade

OK, sorry, I've been vectoring line art since 1990. My current machine is an AMD Athlon XP with the 333 FSB, 1 Gig ram & 80 Gig HD shared on network & a 40 Gig HD for software, OS is XPpro, it's 2 years old I think. I installed three cathode ray tubes, you know; big boxy monitors, the largest of which is a 21 inch monster right in my face all day. I read the reviews here and started "Quaking" in my boots! Oops I said to myself, and I looked up my previous day's purchases for the new Artist I just hired. Sure enough; I bought CS2 for the new machine. So I downloaded the 30 day trial for Illustrator CS2 Upyours, I mean Upgrade. Replacing my old Illustrator 8.01 These kids I've been interviewing made me think I should take a look outside MY CAVE! So I got it loaded up and sure enough; it takes longer to load than my old corrupted rusty buddy; Illustrator 8.01, about twice as long. ( so leave it running )

!!!!!!!!! BUT WOW !!!!!!!

I should have done this sooner, or should I have ?
As soon as It was running Illustrator CS2 AUTO UPDATED ITSELF.
It wanted it's Adobe Bridge fixed up. So I let it. This is just exactly what people have been complaining about.

******** THE BRIDGE IS FIXED *********

WAY SUPER COOL DUDE! I keep the Bridge open on the right monitor and I can drag art into Illustrator CS2 at lightning speed. The whole time I get to see super big previews of all the artwork I need to work with. Way better than XPpro's little thumbnails.

LIVE TRACE: Realy nice, I think this is what these companies are using to sell Vectored Line Art to Printers like me. It is very accurate and seems to acomodate all those nasty giant pixels that up till now, took a human brain to see past while vectoring. OK, it's not as good as a skilled craftsman such as (full of) myself, but for only about $160 or so, it's like a gift from ALMIGHTY GOD!

No crashes, no bugs, just pure inteligence from Adobe once again.
Don't you think of a little white mud hut in the dessert when you say ADOBE?

I really apreciate the Object Oriented work bar thing at the top, wait, let me go look at what it's called, Hmmmm, still don't know, well it changes according to what kind of object you've clicked on in your artwork. Also this new wonder of technology solves an old problem of global color change needed for color separation work. That top task bar object oriented do-hickey is similar but better than the one in Photoshop.

Transparent objects, looks like everything can be transparent, WOW, do you know what that means ??? I gotta go use it some more, it's just way to cool. OK, I'm back, EVEN FONTS can be transparent, .tiffs .jpgs, everything. THIS MEANS way less jumping back and forth from Photoshop to Illustrator.

But I do believe you have to be very capable with your hardware, operating system, and have at least a year; full time with Illustrator and Photoshop to fully appreciate the thought and creative potential that Adobe has opened up for us

Maybe I'm just not pro enough to realize the ways to put some more precise reports together, but that is the only snag in this otherwise capable product.

To accomplish the reports that I need, I am able to edit the Gantt chart view sufficiently to satisfy my purpose.  So, it gets the report done, just not as nicely as I had hoped.

Tracking work is made incredibly simple.  Rest assured you can manage a hefty project with this little piece of software

I decided to get this office suite after using it recently. I've usually worked on Office 97 and 2000, but the 2003 version has some pretty cool features not found in the older versions. The feature that I really enjoy is the Pivot Report feature in MS Access, which wasn't in MS Access 2000. This is a truly great reporting feature. You can now use Access as a front-end to slice and dice data stored on data warehouses in Oracle, SQL Server, Sybase and other enterprise-type databases. If you're used to creating crosstab reports, you'll definitely like the Pivot Report feature. Crosstabs are limited to 2 dimensions but there's no limitation on the number of dimensions in Pivot Report.

To me, the main drawback is the price. (I did get mine at around $370 at J&R, which is a great price.) I figure I can upgrade this in about 5 years time, which works out to about $70 to $75 per year (assuming that I'll be paying about $370 to upgrade in 5 years time.)

A big positive is that this is the industry standard. So the work you put into learning the multiple new features of Word, Excel, MS Access is not wasted because you can reuse the same skills in another job. Your time will be well spent. Note that the software may seem bloated but the intelligent user is able to choose and pick the most useful and relevant features of each application and ignore the features that are not useful. Different features are useful to different people...

Another positive: Each product in Office Professional is fully programmable using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) which you can use to build custom programs. This very powerful feature is sometimes overlooked when shopping for Office suites.

You can read it BEFORE buying the product by looking on the ZA site. I'm going to make this hard and make you google it. 
I'm not going to criticize anyone except to say IF you have a question or problem, the ZA website lists pdf file user manuals for all of the company's products. There are some compatibility probs for example with Yahoo Mail BETA. As soon as Yahoo finalizes it's mail server ZA will be compatible. Simply switch back to yahoo mail (pre beta). There are several other beta products but generally if you're having problems they can be easily fixed by adjusting the settings just like all security programs. ZA REALLY is better at what it is suppose to do than other products ONCE you have learned how to use it. Kinda like most things in the world of things that are unfamiliar. 
I use the free stuff too, and recommend them for those who are on a budget - students, etc. but the ZA suite is worth the money and is more effective for those who can't afford to get mugged or pickpocketed on the info hiway. I know what you're thinking btw...but ask yourself "Is your private information, time  and computer worth it to you?" If so go with Zone Alarm, learn how to use it and be safer on the net.

As you can see by other reviews above, the Studio series has a history of being buggy.  You also hear a lot of people saying "This package is so much more intuitive and easy to use than the other 'powerful enough to be worth owning' packages -- if only it were more stable!"  

I am one of those long-suffering users (5 years, going back to Version 9), and finally with Version 10.6 I have stopped complaining -- it now works as I'd hoped when I bought it.  The $300 I spent on other packages trying to do better was wasted -- I kept getting frustrated with interfaces that a 500-page manual couldn't clarify.  And I'm a very sophisticated computer user by most measures.

I am turning all of our old family video tapes and CD's into DVD's.  I use Studio for all the editing (have not tried the DVD recording -- just use Roxio for that) and am now very pleased.  If you own 10.5 then version 10.6 is a free download.

One important piece of advice that would have saved me lots of problems: put every "project" you work on in a separate subdirectory.  If you have 5 soccer game videos make a /game1, /game2 etc. series of subfolders.  If you edit those to a "Jimmy's great plays" proect, put it in a separate /JimmyPlays folder.  When projects are in the same folder and you edit them a few times weird overwrite problems can happen in 10.5.  I learned this trick before 10.6 came out, and I don't know if it matters any more but I take no chances.

Why did I stick with something where I admit that version 9.0 was "powerful but unstable" and 10.0 was "more powerful and more unstable"?  Because I can actually use Studio with minimal reference to instructions, and when I use it things turn out as I expect.  Now that it has become stable and reliable I am a VERY satisfied customer.

So that's how I got from being a frustrated Studio customer to giving it 4 stars on this review.  I tell the whole story so you understand that the other reviews from frustrated people are relevant for the older versions, but that "10.5 updated for free to 10.6" really is the best choice out there now... as my unused expensive rivals to Studio on my shelf prove.  Just keep putting every project inn its own folder!

I've been using Studio for years and while I definitely had reliability problems with Studio 10.0, 10.6 has been very reliable, and beta testing 10.7 shows me it is just getting better.  I tried Premiere Elements but it was much harder to figure out how to do things, and it was much slower burning a simple DVD image, and it simply doesn't do HD which I've started playing with.  I'm sticking with Studio and I make a DVD just about every week with my kids' videos.  I do recommend that you have a good system that is fairly clean

I have had nothing short of an excellent experience with this product. I have created numerous videos of my children's escapades and sporting events. I do have one warning however. Provide the grandparents with a box of tissues because they never fail to cry when they see their little angels parading across the widescreen. The software is extremely intuitive and easy to use. My wildest expectations were exceeded.

This program is positively wonderful for word practice and pronunciation with a number of flash-card style game and  a very elegant listen-record-replay interface. While the two characters do pronounce words slightly differently, hearing those variations really helps to understand the phonetics in a way that a single voice would lack.

However, this really is more of a companion tool for a more traditional course. I purchased this with "Colloquial Icelandic" and would definitely recommend purchasing them together. There are some extremely strange spelling/pronunciation variations and without having a written explanation of these things, you may be left staring in great confusion as the characters read phrases on screen -- "Hva" is pronounced "kwah?" WHAT? Having "Colluquial Icelandic" to turn to for explanation helped a great deal. That package has two audio CDs of alphabet, number, vocabulary and conversation exercises with a very well-written 370 page coursebook.

I gave this product a 5-star rating as it is superb for its intended purpose, but it does not stand alone as a complete course

I bought Version 5 of this software a few years ago and was very pleased with the many features.  A tech at my Isp (BellSouth) recommended this software to me. I recently purchased version 6 for my new laptop which is running Windows Xp Pro.  Installation was a snap.  Updates are frequent and install quickly with my Dsl connection.  The software suite has in my opinion more and better features than Norton Pro which I use on my desktop.  I really like the Registry cleaner (fixer) and the defrag tools.  (They use Trend Micro for virus protection) The program allows simple maintenance or for more experienced users indepth tools that allow you to maintain and tweak your system. There is a lot of extra programs that come with this software that I did not install after reading some reviews and warnings about using them.  However, my personal experience after installing just the System Suit 6 Professional has really been good for me. I bought my copy from Walmart and filled out the rebate following the instructions carefully and I received my rebate after about 6 weeks.  I hope if anyone buys this software because of my recommendation will have similar results.  I would rate my knowledge of computers as above average, which may be why I did not have any problems with the software.

I just upgraded my Webster software to this version for WinXP.  It's ok and does the job it's intended to perform. But I liked the previous versions that displayed both the definitions and the thesaurus in parallel panels. Just a matter of display preference, so it's not that important to every user.

Buy this CD.  Don't waste your money on the subscription at merriam-webster's website.

ALso try the Medical dictionary.  It is as equally superb

i have a question about this.  I'm wondering if i can hook my guitar into my computer and record it and then like add drums and loops an stuff onto it.  Is that possible on this program?  Cause my friend has Acid Pro 4.0 and that is really awesome but it's like $400 and i dont have that kinda money.  Wut i liked about Acid  Pro 4.0 is that you could hook up ur guitar to the computer and stuff like that, so im wondering if you can do that on this program.  If u have an answer for me, e-mail me at PeepilotT@aol.com .

I discovered this software by accident, while window shopping, and I ended up buying it and taking it home.  I was able to get it up and running pretty quickly, and was creating my own music right out of the box.  Of course it takes some time, but this program makes it possible to make some pretty good music in your spare time.  Add a mic to your computer,and you can pretty much turn your computer into a recording/editing studio, make your own music and burn it to CD.  Sounic Foundry also makes it easy to publish your work to the web, by providing an online community of Acid music-makers who review and comment on one anothers' work.  You can also listen to music published by other users.  Even if you're just a musical legend in your own living room, this makes it easy and fun to become just that.  Sound Forge also sells music loops on CD especially for Acid, but you can find lots of free loops on the web that also work.  Sound Forge also provides weekly samples for free on their Acid Planet website

I am a veteran screen printer and am kind of new to the graphic arts side.  This purchase has paid for itself over and over now that I don't have to run to someone else for art.  It was rumored that it is hard to find what is needed as there is no computer search for images...  I guess some people are too lazy to familiarize themselves with the book of images...  I did and I LOVE this product!!!!

Good for those looking for a vector collection.  Not so good for those looking for photo clip art, as photos are "high-res" at 200 DPI.  I suppose the photos are useful to an extent, but the usefulness is limited by size.  I was looking for vector art, so I am satisfied

  My experience with this software as well as the company has been extremely positive. I ordered this program a little over a month ago. When I first received it from Amazon, I was amazed at the shear size of the program. It has a HUGE 1,300 page book with all the images and categories for easy reference. It also comes with 34 CDs that are loaded with images. This software is truly the largest set of art I have ever seen!
  Dealing with Nova Development is as easy to use as their software! When I first opened the box I was a little overwhelmed with the whole thing, so I called tech support. I may have waited a whole 20 seconds before I began speaking with a technician. They walked me through the install and how to use the clip art. They were professional and courteous.
  This software gets an A+ in my book!.

I've been looking at buying this collection for some time now and I finally broke down and bought it.  Very pleased with everything included.  LOTS of stuff to use, and not just cheezy clip art - lots of boarders, symbols, brush strokes, etc.  The bundle that i bought contained 1 wrong disc (disc 3 was actually disc 30) - one phone call and a new one was sent to my house no questions asked.

I run the after school program at the local JR high where i work. We try to push the importance of computer skills on the children. I just upgraded to the 800,000 clip art library. We use these images for just about every project. I have never wanted a certain type of image and not been able to find it!!!

Homesite is widely recognized as "the" premier tool for coding HTML, client side, and server side code by hand. Adding it to your resume won't land you a job, but it will certainly boost your chances of getting an interview because it indicates that you are not a cheap, WYSIWYG junkie.

One of the things I like best about Homesite 5 is the adaptability it allows when coding in ASP.NET. I was able to find a plug-in, which when added to Homesite, recognized the .NET tags and colors them accordingly. There are similar plug-ins for just about every language out there.

If you are unfamiliar with HomeSite, are considering a purchase, but are not sure it's the right tool for you, here's a very brief description on how it works: This is not a drag-and-drop design tool that created the code for you. It is, in essence, a text editor on steroids. As you code BY HAND it will color the code for you, tell you when you've made errors, offer you a ton of help on knowing what tags mean, has a built in FTP client, helps you organize your work into projects, and a bunch of other functions I've never used.

Here's the main thing you need to know: If you're a HomeSite pro, then you are also a REAL developer.

To everyone who has whined about lack of support: What do you expect for less then $100? If you purchase a flagship product from Macromedia such as Dreamweaver, Studio MX, or Fireworks, you'll get all the support you'll need.

Also, I've been able to find PLENTY of FREE support from news groups and email lists that focus on web development. For every problem or question I've found someone who knows the solution. You can too!!!

Just a note: Amazon is behind the times. From the Macromedia website you can now purchase two versions ahead of what Amazon is offering.

Well worth the $99.00

...and I knew it wouldn't be the last. Very very fun. Don't think Nancy Drew is just for girls, guys can play and love the game as well. I am living proof of that.

The game itself really isn't that hard, it is just some of the puzzles can be very tricky (I don't like puzzles) and that is the only 'beef' I have with the game, and most mystery games. 

Now, back to the game itself.. intriguing storyline, suspicous characters and they all got something to hide. Search for clues while interrogating suspects.. explore the resort, run errands, break into locked rooms without getting caught, disable alarms, and SNOOP.. and that is just the tip of the iceburg.

If  you like mystery games, Nancy Drew is for you! Her games aren't overly hard, and they are very fun. Even if you aren't a mystery fan, try it! You'll love it. Try them all! You will become a Nancy Drew fan, trust me.. I did

This was a wonderful game!  Hours of good, solid game play.  An interesting mystery and intriguing characters.  A chance to interact with aquatic life.  I learned how to work a GPS and a HAM radio.  It was so much fun.  The puzzles were a good mix of ability-levels and types.  Word puzzles, spatial puzzles, problem-solving ones.  I can completely recommend this game

I am very happy with it but it doesn't live up to my expectations.
I also have the reg. Plus for XP and I really don't think the extra money is worth it.  If I were to do over I would still have bought the Plus superpack for XP but not the regular Plus just because I do have a Media Center PC. If I didn't have that the regular Plus for XP would have been just fine

Not a complicated application, but it successfully repartitioned a 100G drive into 3rds on a new Lenovo laptop with XP SP2.  I would recommend using the DOS version which you can get just by booting on the CD.  Requires no install, you can simply boot, make the changes, and it is done.  Seems to be very straightforward and I would just be inherently nervous about repartitioning the boot drive with Windows running

I installed a WD 320G usb drive to use as a backup drive. I used the HD backup software to do auto backups. Unfortunatly the software took controll of the entire drive and I could not use it as you would a normal drive (Drag n drop)or access a particular file.   I used Partition Magic to reclaim my USB drive and in the process I partitioned the drive. The drive now works as I want it to I have control!

Partition Magic was very easy to use and didi a perfect job.

I am amazed what this program can do. It is a big difference from PS 5.5. It is a new learning curve but well worth it. What used to take me hours to do is now an action and done in 2 minutes. Amazon had the best price for me from a source I trust ordering from. It is worth it

Photoshop is incredibly awesome!!!  And in reality most professionals already know that fact and have no need to read further about the program, it is a must have for them. However the learning curve here is extremely steep.  This program is designed for people that use it in their jobs daily to produce images for sale.  There are less inexpensive and easier to use programs out there for people looking to edit images for personal use including Photoshop elements.

I won't include my website URL here, but I'm a professional photographer, who displays and sells his work at juried exhibitions. I've been using Photoshop since version 5.0, roughly 6-7 years.

Frankly, I'm surprised to see how many negative reviews there are here of Photoshop CS2, and that overall the product only gets three stars. I understand all the frustration, though. Even on a top-of-the-line machine, "PS CS2" can be slow at times. However, in my case, that's because I'm working on incredibly large files. 

For example, my camera / scanner combination typically produces 50 megapixel images. By the time multiple layers are added in PS, one image file can be 500 MB - 1 GB in size. This is exactly why I have a dual-Opteron system with 4 GB of RAM: so I can work on these monster files in Photoshop!

For me, Photoshop is a must-have. There are *no* alternative programs for me to consider that can handle my files and do what I want to get done. I don't even want to mention all the advanced features that I use on a daily basis, frankly because that's part of my edge as a professional. I've spent over five years working in PS everyday, and have carefully studied several advanced books on PS. The learning curve is long, but the rewards are great if you have high goals and high standards.

Yeah, Adobe's got some major improvements to make, along the lines that other reviewers have mentioned. For me, the only real problem is poor and often wasteful use of system memory. And I would agree with other reviewers here that for most people, the full Photoshop CS2 is probably a waste of money. Photoshop Elements is probably a better way to go, though I haven't used it personally. I know a good web designer who uses Paint Shop Pro, and who seems to be happy.

IMHO, some people are probably drawn to Photoshop the way others are drawn to AutoCad or Solidworks or 3D Studio Max. All these programs are incredibly powerful tools that can support an entire career if one puts in the time and effort to become a true expert user. You can't make a career out of PS Elements, or Paint Shop Pro, or GIMP, or whatever else other reviewers may mention. PS CS2 is "the standard" for image manipulation

Adobe Photoshop has a long history of being the best software in the business.  It's only downside is that it may seem a bit daunting to the beginning user.  There is, however, a plethora of texts, tutorials, learning guides, and even video's to help abate the learning curve

I have Fireworks, Corel Paint, and now CS2 to choose from. Perhaps it's my familiarity with PhotoShop that makes me so partial to it, but I feel it's the best imagery software on the market. I upgraded to this from PS7, so I missed out on CS, but from what I can tell, this is the smoothest-running version yet. I've not encountered any problems with system or support... I guess everyone's experience is different. But this is great software, and the Vanishing Point feature is just brilliant

The new Adobe Acrobat has a cleaner look and feel, and is more user-friendly.  I especially apreciate the new quick distiller buttons in any Microsoft application, which allow you to create a PDF in one click rather than having to go to File and Print. Some functionality as before, with some new organization and better look/feel

Even if one could afford the full PhotoShop CS or CS2, Elements has it all for the photo enthusiast.  Elements has an uncluttered interface with two choices for photo manipulation;
Quick Fix and Standard Edit. The Browser is adequate though I've used simpler ones for organizing and finding photos. Many of the features of the full program can be found in Elements like Layers, plug-ins for effects, and a variety of adjustmens.  With a little patience and experimenting, as well as magazines that include video tutorials for specific needs you'll be surprised how creative you can be. This program does not have the learning curve of the full PhotoShop software yet is more than powerful enough for the creative amateur photographer

This program is fantastic. It's super easy to use and has a calendar that will notify you of upcoming events/holidays/etc. There are loads of pre-made cards to choose from or you can edit them to your needs. You can also make your own card without any help. The same thing for envelopes! 

There are also quite a few additional projects included. You can create your own stationary sets (paper and envelopes), awards and certificates, kid's activity pages and more.

I highly recommend this program if you're a beginner card maker. I mostly bought this (I was a beginner) to save money on cards and in the 2 months I've had this program, it has more than paid for itself. It's much more convenient than going to the store, WAY cheaper and I really like being able to make matching envelopes.

I was really surprised to read some of the other reviews about this product -- it's as we we've purchased entirely different programs. In my experience with this software, I've found it to be extremely smooth-running and user-friendly from installation to printing, and the card selection and customization is second to none. 

There have been perfect cards for every occasion to date and we've customized them countless ways -- adding and editing photos, moving text, sending ecards, you name it! Navigating within the art studio is very intuitive.

Printing cards from the sofware is very easy and the on-screen configuration works great. Unlike some of the other reviews, I haven't had the problem of having to re-configure every time I print. We set it up once and that was it. I've printed on card stock paper, which turns out gorgeous, and we've also printed the quarter-fold plain letter size which also looks great and works perfect with size A2 envelopes (this is a great printing option if you don't want to buy card stock paper!).

I've used this software on all of my computers, have recommended it to many people, and so far have not yet encountered or heard of any problems. I highly recommend it. It's a fun program, the recipients will love their customized cards, and it will save you money in the long run

This suite of applications is excellent.

They run much faster on my Mac than even the equivalent Mac programs.

I love them and use them quite happily every single day. 

A great value for students and teachers

I bought this package because my daughter needed to be able to do word processing and make presentations for school.  I used it because its what is being used at my office.  I wish they had included Frontpage instead of One Note (which I really haven't been able to find a use for).  Otherwise, it works the same as other MS Office packages I've used in the past

I followed all instructions before I attempted to do an upgrade from Windows Me to Windows XP - infact, the more I read the more I was told to do a clean upgrade.  So, I did a backup and removed programs that were not compatible and I got some instructions off the internet on how to do it and it went very smooth. I love what it gave me. Clean upgrade means a clean start - you remove everything and start with a new program

I have been using Microsoft Operating Systems for a very long time, and, i still say that this is the best System out there, for many reasons.

An increasing amount of Linux and Mac users have made the claim that they are more compatible with programs, and are less vulnerable to virus and hacks.

In Response to Linux Users-
Stay away from Linux, Linux is free for a reason. It is compatible with very very few programs as it is, and that number will only decrease. For Gamers - Rarley do i see a Linux compatible game. Just stay away from this system.

For Mac Users-
Mac's also have a lesser amount of compatible programs. Fewer and Fewer programs can run on them, and like linux, that number will only decrease. The only thing keeping Macintosh alive is Itunes. Which is compatible with Windows. Besides, When Direct X 10 Comes out, it will only be available for Windows, making Macintosh's un-usable for new games when the next windows OS comes out (Microsoft Vista). The computers are also generally more expensive than Windows.  Btw - You can get viruses on Mac's

I have been running XP for a few days and so far so good. I was running win98se and decided to upgrade after microsoft announced that they no longer support win98. My software is now obsolete? Yikes! Well, I'm glad I upgraded.

Installation went smooth as silk and I have not experienced any problems at all. I had to find a couple of new drivers for hardware but that's been it. And for Home Edition versus Pro, I think I can be quite happy with the Home Edition.

I will say that win98se had been a headache for a long time so the stability that I see so far with XP Home is a relief.

Good features, good reliability. A very decent upgrade. I recommend it. Four stars

Honestly, I don't know how much more they can improve Adobe Acrobat.  It is an excellent product, and a god-send for electronic file management.

I upgraded from version 6.0.  The only problem I had with 6.0 is that it seemed terribly slow.

This new version seems much brisker.  It loads quickly, and files seem to "print" to it much more quickly than version 6.0.  I do not utilize the "one-button" feature it provides in MS Office and other programs.  I try to keep all my programs as non-integrated as possible, because my previous experiences showed that they really, really bog each other down, no matter how much their makers claim they won't.

I don't come close to using all the features of Acrobat, but for my needs, it far surpasses anything else I've tried (or researched).

If you're having problems with version 6.0, or have an older version that you just want upgraded, I strongly recommend this.  However, I don't foresee ever needing to upgrade Acrobat again

I have been using v.7 from the last week or so and i am very pleased with it. It loads very fast (unlike all other adobe versions), the conversion to PDF from doc or ppt files also is much quicker. 

I have not encountered any problems yet, but its only been 7 days since i am using it..

Definitely worth the upgrade

Version 6 seemed to go off the track by changing many users' favorite features, like form ordering along with how unattractive bookmarks had become. More than anything, version 7 increases one's ability to collaborate securely, providing complete control over your document, who can open, print, or even comment on it. But version 7 is more of a fix than a major upgrade, as it cures many of the ills of the previous version. Best of all, Adobe has kept the price the same. Very nice

First, if you're thinking about using these photos for print, you may wish to think again.  Most objects run between 300-600 pixels in width or height, or 1-2 inches at 300 DPI.  Stretch them bigger than that, and they'll start to blur and/or get jagged.

Also note, that if you try to export/save an image from the Hemera Image browser and select the 300 DPI setting, the browser may stretch the graphic larger than it's actual size, causing blurring and jaggedness right out of the gate.

You need to use the "Use Image's Full Size" checkbox when exporting images.  If you specify a 300 DPI size, and don't use that checkbox, you'll get a stretched image.  

For example, the first image in the collection (the pocket watch) is only 384 pixels wide. If you specify 300 DPI and don't check the "Use Image's Full Size" box, the software will stretch it to 642 pixels wide.  The stretching will cause the image to look fuzzier and/or more jagged when you use it in a web site or print project.

All that said, if you're going to use the images for the web, they're great.

You get almost all the images you'd find in their three "Photo Objects" collections, each of which is much more expensive than this single collection.  The difference is the Photo Objects collections offer about 20-30% higher resolution (i.e. the first image in the collection is 384 pixels wide, but is 492 pixels wide in Photo Objects) and you can save the Photo Objects images with transparent backgrounds (while this collection forces you to specify a color for the background).

For the price, this is a good collection.  There are lots of shots with minor variations, so it may seem like duplication, but for someone trying to get something just right, that slightly different tilt of the head may be just what the doctor ordered

OneCare is not a tweaker's friend. It has no knobs and gizmos for power users to tinker with. However, it does one thing right. It works. When you use it, you truly do have one care. Do what it tells you to make it green. If you can do that, your computer is safe from viruses, hackers, malware, spyware, known security vulnerabilities, low disk space, slow disk access, and data that is not backed up.
OneCare takes a layered approach to keep you and your data safe. It has an inbound firewall to keep bad stuff out of your computer. If bad stuff gets through the firewall, it has antivirus to stop it from affecting your system and an outbound firewall to keep it from spreading. If that doesn't stop the bad stuff, it makes sure you have a backup of your data on a separate drive or on CDs.
In the past, I haven't bought security products. There are plenty of free ones on the market that do a satisfactory job. However, ever since I tried OneCare as a beta tester, I fell in love with it. It is simple to use.
Reduce your worries about being online down to OneCare and try it today. You can even install it on other computers to help keep friends and family protected

don't get me started on that latter program, argh
</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
Nobody, and I mean NObody, could be more of an Illustrator novice & ignoramus than I. Several months ago I was given a licensed copy of Illustrator 9 that a departing coworker had used. Wanting a chance to design the departmental logo that otherwise would've gone to an agency, I raised my figurative hand and volunteered blindly for duty. Having taught myself everything from MS-DOS to TurboCAD, to Photoshop Elements, not to mention Word, Excel, and Powerpoint (don't get me started on that latter program, argh), I figured I could tackle at least the basics of Illustrator 9. Loaded it on my laptop, took it home for a weekend....and just about lost my sanity -- and several fingernails -- trying to learn that confounding program. I managed to produce a few logos, one of which was chosen. But egads, what a big, stinky bear Illustrator 9 was to wrestle. 

When I saw that CS2 had this Live Trace feature, I pleaded with my workplace Santa to get it for me, and WOW! What an overall improvement!! 

Illustrator will still not be as intuitive to pick up as an MS Office product, but this comes darn close. With CS2, they've given us "hot tips" -- little clues about what some of the tools do, that pop up when you mouse over the tool. The intuitive menus are nice too. Also cool is that all the text & paragraph and fill & stroke features, which used to be huge boxes taking up valuable real estate on the screen, are now condensed up on a small horizontal toolbar, like in the Office products ... and when you mouse over them, the screen tips tell you how to expand them. Aaaahh! Finally some help for dunces like me. 

Live Trace and Live Paint are unbelieveably cool. The very first thing I did after loading CS2 was to grab a .jpg photo of a soccer ball off Google Images, and within 20 minutes, without consulting any book or online Help, I'd converted it into a simple graphic image painted into the 2 colors I wanted. 

But as for a great guidebook, the reviewer who suggested Illustrator Visual Quickstart guide by Elaine Weinmann was dead-on. I've bought several other "highly rated" books to try to help me through the confounding quagmire of Adobe products, so I've seen them all. The Visual Quickstart book doesn't have any of that insufferable "wanna-be-a-comic-novel-author" writing, and focuses just on the basics. And it's very literal, with step-by-step instructions. Still there's no substitute for the utterly excruciating process of learning Illustrator through experience. But the Weinmann book's better than any I've seen yet. 

The only reason I haven't given this product a 5 is because it still doesn't have the intuitiveness that it needs. In that way it's still "snobby" -- aimed at pros, not folks like me who need to do occasional design stuff but not for a living. But this is a far, far, far cry better than Illustrator 9. Absolutely worth the money, just for Live Trace and Live Paint alone.

I feel Home Designer Suite 6 is a good value for the price. It obviously is not a full blown pro program, which I think many people expect, however it is a great tool for an ordinary person to do preliminary plans for new construction or remodeling. Those plans can then be provided to a architect or builder as a foundation for final planning. It is quite easy to learn the basics by merely following the tutorials in the manual, or on the provided CD

This is a good software for casual use (hiking, biking, geocaching), but not without issues. On the positive side, it definitely beats all non-digital (scanned USGS maps) alternatives. The level of details is good enough(how many of us need to know topography down to 5 feet?). The fact that maps are digitally generated (with vectors I believe) makes all the labels clear at any scale. It has two advantages over its main "digital" competitor, NG Topo. First, all of the US is on one DVD for the price of separate state/region CDs from NG. And second, it is available. I could not even find NG's Northeast edition anywhere on the web! One might think NH and ME are some obscure corners of the globe and not big tourist destinations.

Now the few negatives. The Exchange feature with GPS is flaky. Sometimes it takes several tries of unplugging and replugging the cable and restarting the program before it recognizes my Garmin. Part of it could be that low and mid range GPS still have serial connection and are not truly plug-and-play even with COM-to-USB adapter (beats me why Garmin can't make all their GPS with USB in this day and age). In any case, regardless of whose  fault it is, it is annoying at times not to be able to connect the two smoothly.

The second problem I noticed was with the 3-D window. It clearly consumes a lot of memory and crashes my laptop if I do a lot of rapid rescaling. I ended up just closing that window, since it is pretty much for "coolness" and does not add any real topographical value.

Finally, I had a problem with Delorme's service. I purchased it from Amazon with a rebate offer. However, a month after submitting the necessary info I received a card from Delorme stating that the bar code I sent was not a UPC code. The box only had one bar code on it so I am not sure how I could have made a mistake. They requested that I send a correct one, but with the code cut out and gone, how do they expect me to come up with one?! I feel a little bit like that was a cheap way out of paying the rebate but $20 is not worth the time arguing with them over it. I would be interested to hear if anyone else experienced the same problem.

There are complaints about Win XP SP2 being too expensive or complaints about technical problems.

It is too expensive, but it is the standard at so many companies, big and small, around the world.

I just wanted to say that anyone who gives Windows XP SP2 a one star rating really doesn't understand much about the Windows operating system, and therefore you should not take into consideration their uneducated opinion about operating systems in general.

The price is a bit high, but Windows is what it is...  a dominant operating system

I didn't encounter any problems with this product infact it was much easier to use and it allows you to combine and orginaze text files, chart spreadsheets, drawings, PDF documents and more into a single compressed package with advanced security features it also has many tools, overall this product was fantastic and I cannot recommend this highly enough. The interface and toolbars might be annoying but that is just a slight problem since it can be taken down and become more user friendly. The other reviewers who complained about this being slower need to know that this is just the standard edition which I use, there is a better edition which is The Professional Full Product of Adobe Acrobat 7.0 that also includes an upgrade.....

I have been using Adobe Acrobat for a few years now.  I've used both their Professional and Standard versions.  Now, Adobe has released Acrobat 7.  In this review, I will be discussing primarily the features of the Standard edition.  However, these features are also available in the Professional edition.  Outside of the fact that the Professional version has more workgroup-oriented and enterprise features, these programs are the basically same.  I have noted any features available only in Professional in this review.  

First, what is PDF and what can it do for me?
Adobe's PDF is now a universal format that allows you to preserve the look and integrity of your original documents - Adobe PDF files look exactly like the original pages and fulfill requirements for electronic filing and document security.

Not only that, but you can share the files with anyone, whether on a PC or a Mac.  Each PDF file has the graphics and fonts imbedded into the file.  The user of  the file does not have to have the same font set, nor even purchase Adobe Acrobat, because the Reader version of Acrobat is free!

New Features in Acrobat 7
*	Turn MS Outlook email into searchable documents.  This is a great feature.  It allows you to effortlessly turn those old emails into the universal PDF format.  Acrobat's searching capabilities make even searching through the longest emails easy and accurate.
*	Attaching source files.  Previously, we have been able to create  PDFs from spreadsheet and other formats.  Now, not only can you do that, but this new feature allows you to attach the documents with the PDF!
*	Improved Browser.  Acrobat's browser has been improved to make searching for documents easier.  If you are familiar with the Adobe Photoshop browser, you'll like the new upgraded browser in Acrobat 7.
*	Searching improved.  The search feature has been improved when you are looking for files.  It is easier to search for files, because now Adobe has made the feature more friendly.  You can search by document and text properties on your local computer or across your companies LAN or WAN networked drives.

More About Acrobat
Although many people are familiar with the Acrobat Reader program, they are not as familiar with Acrobat itself.  I consult will many business persons and they are just astounded at what Acrobat 7 can actually do for their business.  Just the fact that you can collect and assemble output from different types of programs into on universal format floors them every time!  

Another great point about assembling the documents in Acrobat is the compression factor.  With Acrobat, users are able to compress the original documents, thus saving space and making it more efficient to transmit the documents via email or internet downloads.

This new version can now also create, and save "PDF/A" files for archiving and it allows users to  scan paper documents directly into a searchable PDF file saving space and time.  Many companies around the country are making the jump to the "paperless" environment.  Acrobat 7 can definitely help.

In fact, I know of an attorney's office making great use of Acrobat.  They have almost converted their entire office to a paperless organization by using Acrobat because of its form creation, reviewing, commenting, approval and signature features.  In paper document storage space alone, this office is saving thousands of dollars per year.  Even legal documents can be approved, digitally signed and verified in Acrobat.

Anyone concerned about the security of their documents has nothing to fear.  Acrobat's security features including the ability to create self-signed digital IDs are terrific; no matter if you have PDF documents loaded on your website for downloading to clients or if you are emailing the files.  For Professional users, Adobe has added a new feature called E-envelopes.  With the new E-Envelopes, user can package their PDF files in an encrypted wrapper and send those files securely via email.  For company networks, Adobe has also added support for your company-wide security policies using a new feature called Lifecycle Policy Service.  The granularity of the security allows the user to pick exactly what they will allow the recipient of the file to do like printing, copying, pasting and so on.  

Many people are also surprised that Acrobat isn't just for static documents.  Users can create interactive forms (Professional Only) as well.  In fact, I know a client who is an attorney.  They have almost converted their entire office to a paperless organization by using Acrobat because of its form creation, reviewing, commenting, approval and signature features.  In paper document storage space alone, this office is saving thousands of dollars per year.

For CAD and graphics professionals who work with 3D files, Acrobat 7 (Professional Only) can now convert these into PDF format for ease of viewing, whether in electronic or printed format.  This will allow the users to quickly send their clients views of the 3D object in the universal PDF format without the purchase of additional software for the recipient of the file.
Another feature is the new licensing capability that Adobe has added to Acrobat 7.  You can install the program and activate it on two separate computers, which is great if you work at home and at the office as well.  Need to install it on a third computer?  Not a problem.  The transfer activation feature allows you to transfer the license to another computer.  To do this, deactivate one copy and transfer the activation via a simple menu command. If your computers have internet access, the change happens right away.  This feature alone may save users money on purchasing multiple copies of the software.
Summary
I would highly recommend this product to anyone in business.  The easy of use and versatility of Adobe Acrobat 7 make it an indispensable tool,  whether you are a legal professional, an IT company, accounting firm, healthcare company or anyone else in business.
This is one investment where the ROI will definitely outweigh the purchase price of the software within weeks of normal use.  The ability to go paperless and save valuable office space that is now gobbled up by filing cabinets, paper binds and closets alone should make the difference for almost any company.
Testing Setup
To conduct tests of the software, the following hardware was used:
PC Compatible System (2 GHz Athlon Processor, 512 MB Ram, 30 GB HD)
Epson Scanner/Fax/Printer
HP LaserJet 8150DN Printer
For software tests (conversion to PDF format), the following software was used:
MS Office 2003 (Word, Excel, Outlook)
Photoshop CS

I'm a longtime Mac user and for re-naming and archiving and cataloguing thousands of images iView Media Pro is the best, I really like the feature that let's you produce and publish on-line galleries of your images, without any code or html experience, using only a very simpe interface and you're ready to go.

For the full-time photographer or amateur, I highly recomend it

This is an all around awesome product. I have had great experiences with the program, and use it very often as we use it to create our entire high school's yearbook. Anyone one who says it doesn't have the basics is pretty much lying to you, it has anything you'll ever need and more. The people who review this product poorly do so because they don't know how to use everything in it. 

The only problem I've ever had is learing everything you can do with it, otherwise it is perfect

Tighter Integration Now Possible with InDesign CS2

Adobe has totally re-done the interface to streamline it and make it cleaner from versions prior to CS.  If you are a QuarkXpress user, you'll find that in InDesign CS2, you get the feeling that it is laid out in a logical and easy-to-use manner.  The tools and tool palettes are where you'd expect them to be in the menu structure and on the screen.  Small touches like being able to save your workspace, like you can do in Photoshop CS2, are great.

I tested the integration between InDesign CS2 and some of its counterparts in the Adobe Creative Suite Premium.  I created different graphics in Photoshop CS2 and Illustrator CS2 and I found it was really easy to import them into InDesign CS2 and use.  You can effects like drop shadows and feathering to images directly in InDesign CS2.  No need to go to another program.  With the Control Palette you can also resize objects too.  This palette functions with Transform and Stroke features for graphics, and it includes paragraph, character and table features for text editing.  What the palette does is affected by the type of selection you have made - either graphic or text. 

I imported some formatted text in from Microsoft Word 2003 and two different tables in from Microsoft Excel 2003.  I was concerned how the tables would appear after the import from Microsoft Excel.  The tables imported easily. With InDesign CS2, you can now automatically style Microsoft Word files on import by mapping Word styles to InDesign CS2 styles as well.

An issue for a long time has been how to preview or view other types of files that you want to incorporate with InDesign CS2.  Now, Adobe "bridges" that gap.  Bridge now comes as a part of InDesign CS2 and the Premium Suite.  So, viewing any Adobe-type formatted file or standard graphic format is easy to do.  Using the same interface between the different programs is a help as well.  Adobe Bridge is a standalone program.

Being a Web Designer and using Adobe (formerly Macromedia) Dreamweaver 8, I was familiar with using Snippets.  These are portions of code you can save for use in other programs or you can export them to give to someone else.  Now,  InDesign CS2 offers this Snippet capability.  You can export objects as snippets. These objects can be shared or reused in other documents. Simply place or drag a snippet into a layout, and  InDesign re-creates the original objects, their formatting, and their relative positioning on the page.  No more wasted time redesigning, just to get something you have brought in from another document to fit.

InDesign CS2 also now has an Info palette that is just like those found in Photoshop and Illustrator.  Size dimensions and resolution are immediately available by selecting the graphic and simply glancing over to the Info palette.  This is a crucial tool when fitting graphics in a specifically space-limited area.  It's important to know the actual dimensions with which you are working.

Sometimes in designing and re-designing printed work, you have to move objects.  When this happens, your structure can often change in different ways.  InDesign CS2 helps you maintain your layout by allowing you to anchor your callouts, pull quotes, margin notes, and graphics to text. You can now precisely control the positioning of Anchored Objects, apply text wrap settings, and more.

As with other Adobe products, it is very easy to export your finished work in PDF format.  InDesign CS2 works so well at exporting to PDF, it even maintains the layers in Acrobat 7.  You can pre-define your Acrobat export settings as well.  InDesign CS2 also supports specialty PDF formats like PDF/X-1a and PDF/X-3, which are used in workflows.  It also supports high-resolution CMYK output and color-managed workflows.

If you are familiar with previous versions of InDesign, the upgrade to the new version is easy.  InDesign CS2 is even backwards compatible CS.  You will find that your learning curve is greatly decreased.

This is the easiest way I've ever been able to make CD's. It realy makes photo CD's easy and produces a great product. A group of frinds and Us just got back from Mexico and I put all of everyones photos in separate files on a CD. The automatic slide show goes through the differn't files as if they were just one file with no seperation, but the pictures are still separated in each person's file for ease when printing and so forth. It's great, wish I would have had this years ago

I have used this software from the very first as a PaintShop product and it still delivers. It has improved with this version. I reckon I have tried all other albums and quick editors but this remains the best. For more detailed work a more expansive editor is needed but that is not the purpose of this program. What it claims to do, it does well. If only it had some way of adjusting the mid tones. A simple histogram would make this a top ranking program

I liked how you could go underwater and try to find things. I also liked how you had to bake cookies and make sundaes. Another really cool thing was that you could buy stuff for Minette and yourself. I didn't like how the tea was so hard,though.I couldn't figure it out,but finally I got it.I liked that you had to fight Minette,too.It was funny that she had an alien tatoo on her face.Over all,Danger By Design was a fun game.

I really enjoy the Nancy Drew games. They can be done as a senior detective with fewer helps or as a Junior detective with a check list of things that need to be done. The check list continues to update as you move through the game. I look forward to each new game as it comes out and can't leave the computer until they are done

I have been playing the Nancy Drew games for a few years now, and have found that with each one the graphics, intrigue & fun just keep getting better & better.

In "Danger by Design" Nancy agrees to go to Paris to help a nervous investor of Minette's House of Fashion.  He's nervous because Minette had begun acting very strangely & had fallen way behind on her new Spring collection - both of which could lead to a failed business venture.

Once there, Nancy becomes aware of several threatening letters the designer had received, as well as a number of rumors concerning artwork that had been stolen during World War II that may be hidden in the old Wind Mill that now serves as Minette's House of Fashion.  Could they be related some how?

As Nancy Drew, you will find yourself snooping around for clues, working to earn the money needed to buy several needed items, solving various puzzles, and ultimately putting all the information together to solve the mysteries surrounding Minette & the stolen artwork.

Overall, I loved "Danger by Design".  It has the best graphics to date for an ND game & it was great fun to play.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who has enjoyed playing other such games, as well as those who enjoyed (or are enjoying) reading the ND series.

Although not perfect, I've used Roxio CD/DVD 6 Platinum and Nero 6, and returned to using this product. This should also be called &quot;Burning CD's for Dummies&quot;, it is THAT easy to use. I've also used it to burn VCD's without a hitch. If all you want is a fast disk copier and compiler, this is for you

If you decide to buy a current greeting card program, there are really only two front-line choices: Art Explosion Greeting Card Factory (currently version 5) or Hallmark Card Studio (currently 2006). There are other programs available specifically for creating cards, but most of them are low quality and outdated, and aren't really worth considering. (A competitive third product featuring American Greetings designs is sadly now long outdated; the designs in the American Greetings program were of similar quality to those in the Hallmark package).

So how do these two products match up? Without a question, if you are looking for quality "canned" cards, the Hallmark program wins. The Hallmark designs are professional, and are equal in quality to cards you would purchase in a store. In contrast, the designs in Art Explosion are adequate but surely NOT up to the quality of a store-bought card. The Hallmark program is also able to simply and correctly print to several different types of card store (although you are stuck with the choices pre-programmed into the software unless you want much frustration). The Art Explosion does a poorer job of correctly and simply printing to a variety of card stock and configurations.

Art Explosion beats the Hallmark program in editing options (more extensive), and in the amount of additional art (clipart, etc.) included with the package.

If you do not plan to use the "canned" cards, then I would recommend Art Explosion. But the average user will likely appreciate the professional, high quality cards in the Hallmark package. Personally, I consider the choice of the Hallmark package over Art Explosion a no brainer. 

A note on versions: The publisher comes out with a new version of the Hallmark program every year (2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, etc.) and the same is true for Art Explosion Greeting Card Factory. Having used many of these versions, I find very little reason to recommend upgrading year by year. Disappointingly, the stock cards in the Hallmark program do not seem to have changed appreciably in many years, and the same is true for Art Explosion.

This program is very easy to use and the projects are beautiful.

Installation is self explanatory. This also goes for the prepararation of cards ect.Detailed instructions apear at each step at the top of the window as the user moves his her mouse-pointer over various portions of the graphics.

 If you are looking for an easy to use program with great results, this is the one to get. With the cost of cards being what it is, this program will pay for itself very quickly. Relatives will like the fact that they are getting greetings which have been personalized. I recommend this  program highly

My dad got this for me to supplement a Latin textbook I have been studying for my high school language course. It is quick and easily understandable. You get plenty of words and phrases, which is perfect for a traveler. If you want to learn the language for the sake of knowing it, not travel, however, you'd better get a book to supplement this. It doesn't teach about pluralization, verb conjugation, or other oddities that the language holds, such as, in Latin, the ending -m which implies a direct object. The Latin CD also does not use the dashes over the vowels (ie. ,,,,). Overall, I am very happy with the product and with the price of $39.99 (USD), but I am also quite glad I have my textbook (ECCE ROMANI) to go with it

This is a great item for any collector or new fans to the X-men. All the older along with the newer issues look great. The CD includes all issues of the Uncanny X-men (1-461) along with Giant Sized and annual issues. There is also comprehensive biographies on the more popular characters and artwork and layouts of the Xaiver Institute. Could it of had more content, maybe, but this will keep one busy for a long time. With easy maneuverabiltity, this is a highly addictive CD with virtually months of entertainment

Nice collection of the complete issues, though, of course, one knows going in that the later Marvel practice of storylines that run through all the books makes the stories provided only a small slice of the full story, which is somewhat frustrating.  

And the earliest years are, of course, somewhat crude (heretically, even the Kirby artwork in the first year is).

But very nice to have in an affordable edition, regardless of the flaws (though best viewed with a large monitor

I've tried this on two different mac computers: an emac desktop and  an ibook G4, it runs perfectly on both. I see that some people are having problems, I'll see if I can help with that at the end of the review.
I'm a huge x-men fan, but can't afford to buy a bunch of back-issues. The essential book collections are affordable, but they're printed in black & white. With this one disc you get almost 500 uncanny issues, including annuals, all are high-quality scan in's. The disc also has a nice little bio section, and comes with the neccessary adobe software. The one down-side is that you miss out on he tie-in issues, whick gets irritating mid-90's, but I'm not docking a star for that because   what you get is well worth the price, and it's clearly stated in the description that this is strictly "uncanny". 
OK, for those of you having trouble getting it to run w/ a mac here's the process:load cd, click cd image on your desktop twice. You'll get a finder window w/ various files/folders, one will have install on it, this should be the adobe software, follow the installation instructions, and move your new adobe reader to applications when finished, restart your computer. Once re-started load the cd again, open adobe reader 6.0 click the folder image in the upper left-hand corner you should have a finder-type window, go to desktop, click on x-men and choose start.pdf. You should be good to go. HT

don't get me started on that latter program, argh
</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
Nobody, and I mean NObody, could be more of an Illustrator novice & ignoramus than I.  Several months ago I was given a licensed copy of Illustrator 9 that a departing coworker had used.  Wanting a chance to design the departmental logo that otherwise would've gone to an agency, I raised my figurative hand and volunteered for duty.  Having taught myself everything from MS-DOS to TurboCAD, to Photoshop Elements, not to mention Word, Excel, and Powerpoint (don't get me started on that latter program, argh), I figured I could tackle at least the basics of Illustrator 9.  Loaded it on my laptop, took it home for a weekend....and just about lost my sanity -- and several fingernails -- trying to learn that confounding program.  I managed to produce a few logos, one of which was chosen.  But egads, what a big, stinky bear Illustrator 9 was to wrestle.

When I saw that CS2 had this Live Trace feature, I pleaded with my workplace Santa to get it for me, and WOW!  What an overall improvement!!

Illustrator will still not be as intuitive to pick up as an MS Office product, but this comes darn close.  With CS2, they've given us "hot tips" -- little clues about what some of the tools do, that pop up when you mouse over the tool.  The intuitive menus are nice too.  Also cool is that all the text & paragraph and fill & stroke features, which used to be huge boxes taking up valuable real estate on the screen, are now condensed up on a small horizontal toolbar, like in the Office products ... and when you mouse over them, the screen tips tell you how to expand them.  Aaaahh!  Finally some help for dunces like me.

Live Trace and Live Paint are unbelieveably cool.  The very first thing I did after loading CS2 was to grab a .jpg photo of a soccer ball off Google Images, and within 20 minutes, without consulting any book or online Help, I'd converted it into a simple graphic image painted into the 2 colors I wanted.

But as for a great guidebook, the reviewer who suggested Illustrator Visual Quickstart guide by Elaine Weinmann was dead-on.  I've bought several other "highly rated" books to try to help me through the quagmire of Adobe products, so I've seen them all.  The Visual Quickstart book doesn't have any of that insufferable "wanna-be-a-comic-novel-author" writing, and focuses just on the basics.  And it's very literal, with step-by-step instructions.  Still there's no substitute for the utterly excruciating process of learning Illustrator through experience.  But the Weinmann book's better than any I've seen yet.

The only reason I haven't given this product a 5 is because it still doesn't have the intuitiveness that it needs.  In that way it's still "snobby" -- aimed at pros, not folks like me who need to do occasional stuff but not for a living.  But this is a far, far, far cry better than Illustrator 9.  Absolutely worth the money, just for Live Trace and Live Paint alone

I was waiting for CS2 after using the CS. There are too many problems in CS. And I am very happy with CS2 now. The software is a lot easier to use, less problems. I have been using illustrator since illustrator 4. CS2 is definitly better than ever!

Not bad, however, in Version 10, was able to use CNTRL + to zoom in.  Used the + on the number pad -- now this function doesn't work, and the only + that works is that in the top row of the keyboard.  The zoom out "-" in the number pad still works, but not the plus.  I say that's not good.

Why ruin things with an upgrade

OK, sorry, I've been vectoring line art since 1990. My current machine is an AMD Athlon XP with the 333 FSB, 1 Gig ram & 80 Gig HD shared on network & a 40 Gig HD for software, OS is XPpro, it's 2 years old I think. I installed three cathode ray tubes, you know; big boxy monitors, the largest of which is a 21 inch monster right in my face all day. I read the reviews here and started "Quaking" in my boots! Oops I said to myself, and I looked up my previous day's purchases for the new Artist I just hired. Sure enough; I bought CS2 for the new machine. So I downloaded the 30 day trial for Illustrator CS2 Upyours, I mean Upgrade. Replacing my old Illustrator 8.01 These kids I've been interviewing made me think I should take a look outside MY CAVE! So I got it loaded up and sure enough; it takes longer to load than my old corrupted rusty buddy; Illustrator 8.01, about twice as long. ( so leave it running )

!!!!!!!!! BUT WOW !!!!!!!

I should have done this sooner, or should I have ?
As soon as It was running Illustrator CS2 AUTO UPDATED ITSELF.
It wanted it's Adobe Bridge fixed up. So I let it. This is just exactly what people have been complaining about.

******** THE BRIDGE IS FIXED *********

WAY SUPER COOL DUDE! I keep the Bridge open on the right monitor and I can drag art into Illustrator CS2 at lightning speed. The whole time I get to see super big previews of all the artwork I need to work with. Way better than XPpro's little thumbnails.

LIVE TRACE: Realy nice, I think this is what these companies are using to sell Vectored Line Art to Printers like me. It is very accurate and seems to acomodate all those nasty giant pixels that up till now, took a human brain to see past while vectoring. OK, it's not as good as a skilled craftsman such as (full of) myself, but for only about $160 or so, it's like a gift from ALMIGHTY GOD!

No crashes, no bugs, just pure inteligence from Adobe once again.
Don't you think of a little white mud hut in the dessert when you say ADOBE?

I really apreciate the Object Oriented work bar thing at the top, wait, let me go look at what it's called, Hmmmm, still don't know, well it changes according to what kind of object you've clicked on in your artwork. Also this new wonder of technology solves an old problem of global color change needed for color separation work. That top task bar object oriented do-hickey is similar but better than the one in Photoshop.

Transparent objects, looks like everything can be transparent, WOW, do you know what that means ??? I gotta go use it some more, it's just way to cool. OK, I'm back, EVEN FONTS can be transparent, .tiffs .jpgs, everything. THIS MEANS way less jumping back and forth from Photoshop to Illustrator.

But I do believe you have to be very capable with your hardware, operating system, and have at least a year; full time with Illustrator and Photoshop to fully appreciate the thought and creative potential that Adobe has opened up for us

Maybe I'm just not pro enough to realize the ways to put some more precise reports together, but that is the only snag in this otherwise capable product.

To accomplish the reports that I need, I am able to edit the Gantt chart view sufficiently to satisfy my purpose.  So, it gets the report done, just not as nicely as I had hoped.

Tracking work is made incredibly simple.  Rest assured you can manage a hefty project with this little piece of software

I decided to get this office suite after using it recently. I've usually worked on Office 97 and 2000, but the 2003 version has some pretty cool features not found in the older versions. The feature that I really enjoy is the Pivot Report feature in MS Access, which wasn't in MS Access 2000. This is a truly great reporting feature. You can now use Access as a front-end to slice and dice data stored on data warehouses in Oracle, SQL Server, Sybase and other enterprise-type databases. If you're used to creating crosstab reports, you'll definitely like the Pivot Report feature. Crosstabs are limited to 2 dimensions but there's no limitation on the number of dimensions in Pivot Report.

To me, the main drawback is the price. (I did get mine at around $370 at J&R, which is a great price.) I figure I can upgrade this in about 5 years time, which works out to about $70 to $75 per year (assuming that I'll be paying about $370 to upgrade in 5 years time.)

A big positive is that this is the industry standard. So the work you put into learning the multiple new features of Word, Excel, MS Access is not wasted because you can reuse the same skills in another job. Your time will be well spent. Note that the software may seem bloated but the intelligent user is able to choose and pick the most useful and relevant features of each application and ignore the features that are not useful. Different features are useful to different people...

Another positive: Each product in Office Professional is fully programmable using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) which you can use to build custom programs. This very powerful feature is sometimes overlooked when shopping for Office suites.

You can read it BEFORE buying the product by looking on the ZA site. I'm going to make this hard and make you google it. 
I'm not going to criticize anyone except to say IF you have a question or problem, the ZA website lists pdf file user manuals for all of the company's products. There are some compatibility probs for example with Yahoo Mail BETA. As soon as Yahoo finalizes it's mail server ZA will be compatible. Simply switch back to yahoo mail (pre beta). There are several other beta products but generally if you're having problems they can be easily fixed by adjusting the settings just like all security programs. ZA REALLY is better at what it is suppose to do than other products ONCE you have learned how to use it. Kinda like most things in the world of things that are unfamiliar. 
I use the free stuff too, and recommend them for those who are on a budget - students, etc. but the ZA suite is worth the money and is more effective for those who can't afford to get mugged or pickpocketed on the info hiway. I know what you're thinking btw...but ask yourself "Is your private information, time  and computer worth it to you?" If so go with Zone Alarm, learn how to use it and be safer on the net.

As you can see by other reviews above, the Studio series has a history of being buggy.  You also hear a lot of people saying "This package is so much more intuitive and easy to use than the other 'powerful enough to be worth owning' packages -- if only it were more stable!"  

I am one of those long-suffering users (5 years, going back to Version 9), and finally with Version 10.6 I have stopped complaining -- it now works as I'd hoped when I bought it.  The $300 I spent on other packages trying to do better was wasted -- I kept getting frustrated with interfaces that a 500-page manual couldn't clarify.  And I'm a very sophisticated computer user by most measures.

I am turning all of our old family video tapes and CD's into DVD's.  I use Studio for all the editing (have not tried the DVD recording -- just use Roxio for that) and am now very pleased.  If you own 10.5 then version 10.6 is a free download.

One important piece of advice that would have saved me lots of problems: put every "project" you work on in a separate subdirectory.  If you have 5 soccer game videos make a /game1, /game2 etc. series of subfolders.  If you edit those to a "Jimmy's great plays" proect, put it in a separate /JimmyPlays folder.  When projects are in the same folder and you edit them a few times weird overwrite problems can happen in 10.5.  I learned this trick before 10.6 came out, and I don't know if it matters any more but I take no chances.

Why did I stick with something where I admit that version 9.0 was "powerful but unstable" and 10.0 was "more powerful and more unstable"?  Because I can actually use Studio with minimal reference to instructions, and when I use it things turn out as I expect.  Now that it has become stable and reliable I am a VERY satisfied customer.

So that's how I got from being a frustrated Studio customer to giving it 4 stars on this review.  I tell the whole story so you understand that the other reviews from frustrated people are relevant for the older versions, but that "10.5 updated for free to 10.6" really is the best choice out there now... as my unused expensive rivals to Studio on my shelf prove.  Just keep putting every project inn its own folder!

I have had nothing short of an excellent experience with this product. I have created numerous videos of my children's escapades and sporting events. I do have one warning however. Provide the grandparents with a box of tissues because they never fail to cry when they see their little angels parading across the widescreen. The software is extremely intuitive and easy to use. My wildest expectations were exceeded.

Previously I owned ColorVision's Spyder2 program and was quite satisfied with it.  It did not include, however, a program for correcting the printer's color rendition. The new Spyder2Pro includes PrintFix Plus.  This along with the monitor correction Spyder2Pro works very effectively.  I am very happy with the program. For the price it is a great addition to Photoshop editing.  The Spyder program allows the monitor and printer to show a print that reflects what the user has taken in his digital camera. I have not found any particular negatives about the program.  In the past I have used their tech service for fine tuning the program.  They were very responsive and helpful.

I have read several reviews and decided the Spyder2Pro would be a good monitor color calibrator for me.   I have a Samsung 970P monitor with all adjustments via software.   The calibration process is very simple and all you have to do is follow the menu of questions during the calibration process.
I like the Spyder2Pro and would recommend it highly.

It does the basic job well.  The calibration runs smoothly and accurately.  Hardware looks and feels solid.  My two completely different brand, size and age CRT monitors ended up with exactly the same colors sitting side by side. 
 
User interface is merely adequate.  Pop up help instructions are better than many I have seen.  You will need to know already how the calibration buttons on your monitors work (the hardwired buttons on the monitor, not software).  In order to make any edits you must run the entire time consuming calibration over.  Sometimes you can use "back" within the calibration, sometimes you must start over.  Also the separate "profile chooser" utility software, has not add or delete profile feature - even if it is a profile created and saved by the calibration software earlier.  You can see it with windows display properties, but it may not appear in the profile chooser list.

Dual monitors is the one obvious reason to choose pro over plus version.  Yes, it does dual monitors, but with an asterisk.  It will create separate profiles, but will only apply the correct profiles automatically at startup to both monitors if you have two separate video cards.  If you have a single video card with dual outputs, it will load the same profile (the last one you created) to both monitors at startup.  This quirk is documented in a readme file on the installation disk (and blames windows for the problem), but this limitation appears nowhere in advertising material, catalogs,  or on the box.  Fortunately there is a work around (not documented) at least with my particular video card and running XP.  After windows opens, you can run profile chooser then choose the correct profile for each monitor.  You may have to use windows display properties settings to specify default profile and rerun the calibration to get the profiles you want to appear in profile chooser and to select the correct profile as default. 

Once it's all set up, running profile chooser is a four of five click procedure, but you must rememeber to check it before using any application that uses color profiles.  And check it after you open the application.  I've had them change after opening photoshop - though not every time.

This program is positively wonderful for word practice and pronunciation with a number of flash-card style game and  a very elegant listen-record-replay interface. While the two characters do pronounce words slightly differently, hearing those variations really helps to understand the phonetics in a way that a single voice would lack.

However, this really is more of a companion tool for a more traditional course. I purchased this with "Colloquial Icelandic" and would definitely recommend purchasing them together. There are some extremely strange spelling/pronunciation variations and without having a written explanation of these things, you may be left staring in great confusion as the characters read phrases on screen -- "Hva" is pronounced "kwah?" WHAT? Having "Colluquial Icelandic" to turn to for explanation helped a great deal. That package has two audio CDs of alphabet, number, vocabulary and conversation exercises with a very well-written 370 page coursebook.

I gave this product a 5-star rating as it is superb for its intended purpose, but it does not stand alone as a complete course

I just upgraded my Webster software to this version for WinXP.  It's ok and does the job it's intended to perform. But I liked the previous versions that displayed both the definitions and the thesaurus in parallel panels. Just a matter of display preference, so it's not that important to every user.

It is wondeful software.  Simple, easy to use, user-friendly, and very accurate in the pronunciation.

Buy this CD.  Don't waste your money on the subscription at merriam-webster's website.

ALso try the Medical dictionary.  It is as equally superb

I used this program on a 5-state road trip of the Midwest, and while overall it was  "adequate," it had some key shortcomings.

The bad stuff:

First, this is not an especially user-friendly program; there is a steep learning curve to operate it with ease and predictability. Spend a LOT of time playing with this BEFORE using it as a primary navigator! A lot of the commands are not intuitive, and you need to go through a lot of menus to figure things out. This can be a problem when you are on the road looking to get somewhere. It doesn't have a lot of clickable buttons on the main screen. For example, to get the program to TALK to you, you must be on a certain tab at the bottom of the screen. If you are on any other of the many tabs, the program doesn't talk to you or show you the turns. It took me HOURS to figure this out! The help function was useless.

Second, the tracking can be very slow, and as a result you can easily overshoot your turns--especially when there are no physical street signs in many areas of the country--which happened to me numerous times. Many times the screen showed me I had a lot farther to go before the scheduled turn, and this caused me to overshoot it when there was no sign.

Third, the "rerouting" function is AWFUL and perhaps the biggest problem with this program: if you stray from the route--even to pull off and get gas--the program flips out and keeps trying to route you back to the original route even if that route is not the easiest or most direct. I have not found a way for it to manually or automatically calculate a new and different route. I also have found no way to modify a route once you begin the route (see below).

Several times in several different cities, the re-routing function was totally wrong--spitting out names of streets that weren't even on the screen at close zoom level. This is a really annoying glitch, and it happened without fail every time I strayed from the route. Once off route, there is no way to hush the program from yelling at you that you're off route, and there is also no way to easily have the program recalculate a CHANGE in the route. When there is construction that you didn't anticipate, for example, this program sucks at being able to change the route once you've started on it. Very annoying. There is no construction updater plug-in, which would be helpful for long term construction projects that go on forever. 

Fourth, the program does NOT audibly warn you if you are going the wrong way on a one way street. This actually happened to me, as there were no "one way" signs on a particular street in Springfield, IL. Though there were green arrows on the screen to indicate one-way, but the voice commands didn't warn me that I actually WAS going the wrong way, so had I not been looking at the screen, I wouldn't have known. You can't always look at the screen when driving. And in Iowa on I35, construction brought northbound drivers over to the southbound lanes. I was heading north in the southbound lanes (as I was supposed to) but there was no visual or audible indication that I was going the wrong way! Big time safety issue here.

Fifth, the search function is wholly lacking and is not easy to use. I needed to find a police station while in Missouri--no such luck. I also needed to find the state fairgrounds in Missouri (which I later came across on the screen) but it did not show up when I intentionally searched for it. Search limitations are the second biggest problem with this program.

Sixth, several times the screen showed me "off route" in a totally blacked-out area with no roads around me when I was in fact on a U.S. highway or interstate. Something wasn't communicating correctly. Other times the screen showed me more than 1000 feet off the highway even though I was certainly on the highway. In Illinois, the screen showed I was pretty much driving through corn fields even though I was on a U.S. Route. This problem is pronounced on multi-lane highways. If you're not in the center lane, often the program indicates you're off route. Very annoying.

Seventh, the zoom level does not stay constant; it fluctuates automatically between high zoom and far-out zoom. I wanted high zoom most of the time to see all the minor roads and landmark indicators, but the program kept zooming out and in every few minutes.

Eighth, the help function is a joke. It is totally lacking in substantive information. The program should come with a separate DVD movie showing how to use it.

Ninth, the program does not recognize a lot of road name synonyms. For example, some U.S. Routes also have county/state/local designation numbers and/or an alphabetic name, but the map often only listed one or two of the many "also known as" names/numbers. This can be quite problematic when the signs on the roads don't match up with the turn commands (e.g. "Turn left on U.S. route 40," when the only street signs showed an alphabetic name and no numbers. This was also quite annoying.

Tenth, the antenna that comes with the program SUCKS. Without fail, I would get a red "no signal" indicator in every city I was in where there were high-rise buildings. This happened in Kansas City, Des Moines, Indianapolis, and Springfield. If you are in a city, you risk having no GPS tracking ability. And yes, my antenna was mounted as recommended. At one point I held it up through my open sun roof with no success.

Eleventh, the main-screen buttons are way too small for use while driving if the laptop is on your passenger's seat. You pretty much have to pull over OR risk crashing to see what you're clicking on. Yes, I'm aware that the disclaimer for the program states you should have a separate navigator to operate the program while driving. I'm also aware that almost no one who uses this program actually has a navigator/operator.

Twelfth, trip planning is lacking. When you input a starting and ending point, the program gives you ONE route. There is no way to easily plan alternate routes or to preview them. True, you can do things like program it not to take you on toll roads, but this function is not easy to use. Several times the program kept me off the interstates when I wanted to be on them, and sometimes it kept my on the interstates when I wanted to be on U.S. or smaller county roads (for sightseeing purposes). I would have to go off route and listen to the program whine about being off route.

Thirteenth, I emailed a list of my concerns/constructive criticisms/recommendations to the folks at Delorme. Never heard back from them, which does concern me as a quality issue.

Ok, so there were some redeeming qualities:

First, *in general* the GPS tracker was on-target. For about 95% of my 2000-mile trip, I knew where I was and the program operated just fine. Just realize that this program (as well as GPS in general) has a lot of limitations, ESPECIALLY when there is bad weather or you are in a woodsy area or place with a lot of obstructions.

Third, you can easily add points of interest and comments yourself. I used this function a lot to mark places where I want to return to take photos in daylight.

Fourth, there is a selectable function to show high contrast colors (black background with bright road colors). This is quite helpful.

In summation, for the money this program is a good deal, but do NOT rely on it (or any GPS program) as your *sole* source of road information/navigation. If I hadn't had my Rand McNally paper road atlas and back-up state and city maps I borrowed from the library, I would have been in big trouble several times.

There are a LOT of ways this program can and should be improved, but in the meantime I'd still recommend it despite the problems. Knowing the limitations that I've listen can save you time and frustration. There is no better alternative IMHO for the price. It's possible that some of my complaints DO have fixes, but you wouldn't know it from the crappy help function.

This is my first experience with GPS.  This product makes using it a simple experience with on board instructions.  Viewing the screen on a Laptop as opposed to most of the Portable GPS units is a definite advantage to the user.  I would purchase another immediately if the need arose.

i have a question about this.  I'm wondering if i can hook my guitar into my computer and record it and then like add drums and loops an stuff onto it.  Is that possible on this program?  Cause my friend has Acid Pro 4.0 and that is really awesome but it's like $400 and i dont have that kinda money.  Wut i liked about Acid  Pro 4.0 is that you could hook up ur guitar to the computer and stuff like that, so im wondering if you can do that on this program.  If u have an answer for me, e-mail me at PeepilotT@aol.com .

I discovered this software by accident, while window shopping, and I ended up buying it and taking it home.  I was able to get it up and running pretty quickly, and was creating my own music right out of the box.  Of course it takes some time, but this program makes it possible to make some pretty good music in your spare time.  Add a mic to your computer,and you can pretty much turn your computer into a recording/editing studio, make your own music and burn it to CD.  Sounic Foundry also makes it easy to publish your work to the web, by providing an online community of Acid music-makers who review and comment on one anothers' work.  You can also listen to music published by other users.  Even if you're just a musical legend in your own living room, this makes it easy and fun to become just that.  Sound Forge also sells music loops on CD especially for Acid, but you can find lots of free loops on the web that also work.  Sound Forge also provides weekly samples for free on their Acid Planet website

This one is definately the best out of all of the previous ACID Music programs.  It has a ton of loops, a really cool looking skin, and much more options than in ACID 1.0 or 2.0.  It comes with two CDs.  One of them has the application on it with some loops and the other CD has nothing but loops and demo songs!  It has over 1,600 unique loops!  Definately a good buy for those who really liked any of the previous ACID Musics

This is a good package for backing up your PC.  Fairly intuitive, although it took me a couple tries to figure out what the software was doing so I could select the right stuff to backup.  It uses good compression to minimize the amount of disk for your backup.  The downside of that is you can't just select a file to restore, you must go through the restore process.  You can select a single file, but it takes a bit of time.  Runs automatically and unobtrusively so it won't interfere with your current work.

I had access to the CD version of this product that came with the Image Library Catalog in the box. I liked using it and although there was a lot of CD disc-trading with 34 discs, it worked well for me. I could usually go to the disc I wanted on the first attempt.

Later, I wanted to add this collection to my home office and went back to the same store where the original version was bought. They had sent back all the CD editions where the image catalog was included in the box and replaced them with the DVD edition that is only 5 discs and you have to send off for the catalog for the low low price of shipping ($4.95). Whenever I go to use the DVD's, I have to wait a long time for the dics to load into memory and almost forever if I request the thumbnail versions to come up in the browser.

I would rather switch discs any day then spend my time staring at the monitor while waiting for the computer to load my information. The store involved is happy because they are using less box space on the shelf (or so the stock personnel said). I am unhappy at having to send off for the manual that says it's included on the box but isn't, the extra money for the shipping, and the awkwardness to use this 'upgraded' product

Good for those looking for a vector collection.  Not so good for those looking for photo clip art, as photos are "high-res" at 200 DPI.  I suppose the photos are useful to an extent, but the usefulness is limited by size.  I was looking for vector art, so I am satisfied

I've been looking at buying this collection for some time now and I finally broke down and bought it.  Very pleased with everything included.  LOTS of stuff to use, and not just cheezy clip art - lots of boarders, symbols, brush strokes, etc.  The bundle that i bought contained 1 wrong disc (disc 3 was actually disc 30) - one phone call and a new one was sent to my house no questions asked.

   I am so pleased with this purchase!! Under normal circumstances if I spend anything over $1.00 I get caught in a spiral of buyers regret. This is a feeling that I have grown accustomed to. When I received the 800,000 through the mail I shredded open the box and started skimming through what new images I could play with. I was astonished!      
   Then, I realized something.....or rather a lack of something. I felt no remorse for buying this! I finally had a collection of clip art that could provide an abundant amount of images for collages, labels, calendars, scrapbooks, and everything else I wanted to do.

For many who like writing HTML/XHTML code, Homesite holds a special place in the heart.  It just feels so right and is addictive.

The tool can be extended, and the extensions use script which makes the development cycle dead easy.

Support from MacroMedia has not been good.  Now Adobe is in the process of buying Macromodia (as on 2005-04-19) so who knows where it all goes.  Saying that people who like this product still like it and prefer it.  If it fits you don't need support.  You just run it day after day and it works great.

(There are alternatives emerging after all these years but none quite do it yet.  CSE and TopStyle are two that are coming along.)

For some it almost seems perfect, for WYSIWYG oriented people, it might be best not to even look at it

Homesite is widely recognized as "the" premier tool for coding HTML, client side, and server side code by hand. Adding it to your resume won't land you a job, but it will certainly boost your chances of getting an interview because it indicates that you are not a cheap, WYSIWYG junkie.

One of the things I like best about Homesite 5 is the adaptability it allows when coding in ASP.NET. I was able to find a plug-in, which when added to Homesite, recognized the .NET tags and colors them accordingly. There are similar plug-ins for just about every language out there.

If you are unfamiliar with HomeSite, are considering a purchase, but are not sure it's the right tool for you, here's a very brief description on how it works: This is not a drag-and-drop design tool that created the code for you. It is, in essence, a text editor on steroids. As you code BY HAND it will color the code for you, tell you when you've made errors, offer you a ton of help on knowing what tags mean, has a built in FTP client, helps you organize your work into projects, and a bunch of other functions I've never used.

Here's the main thing you need to know: If you're a HomeSite pro, then you are also a REAL developer.

To everyone who has whined about lack of support: What do you expect for less then $100? If you purchase a flagship product from Macromedia such as Dreamweaver, Studio MX, or Fireworks, you'll get all the support you'll need.

Also, I've been able to find PLENTY of FREE support from news groups and email lists that focus on web development. For every problem or question I've found someone who knows the solution. You can too!!!

Just a note: Amazon is behind the times. From the Macromedia website you can now purchase two versions ahead of what Amazon is offering.

Well worth the $99.00

Great program but the fact that you can't lock the toolbar into place leads to major amounts of time wasted.  Homesite kind of peaked at version 3 when it was run by Alaire

...and I knew it wouldn't be the last. Very very fun. Don't think Nancy Drew is just for girls, guys can play and love the game as well. I am living proof of that.

The game itself really isn't that hard, it is just some of the puzzles can be very tricky (I don't like puzzles) and that is the only 'beef' I have with the game, and most mystery games. 

Now, back to the game itself.. intriguing storyline, suspicous characters and they all got something to hide. Search for clues while interrogating suspects.. explore the resort, run errands, break into locked rooms without getting caught, disable alarms, and SNOOP.. and that is just the tip of the iceburg.

If  you like mystery games, Nancy Drew is for you! Her games aren't overly hard, and they are very fun. Even if you aren't a mystery fan, try it! You'll love it. Try them all! You will become a Nancy Drew fan, trust me.. I did

This was a wonderful game!  Hours of good, solid game play.  An interesting mystery and intriguing characters.  A chance to interact with aquatic life.  I learned how to work a GPS and a HAM radio.  It was so much fun.  The puzzles were a good mix of ability-levels and types.  Word puzzles, spatial puzzles, problem-solving ones.  I can completely recommend this game

This is by far my favourite HER Interactive Nancy Drew PC game, and I have played them all multiple times. I loved the food aspect of it [my sister's a chef], in the cafe where you could gyp the game into letting Nancy have a muffin or a bowl of delicious New England clam chowder anytime you wanted to making a sandwich for Katie; AND calling Bess and George to hear how Bess is learning to cook from a TV show and hearing her worry about what she's making.

The puzzles were not nearly as difficult as some more recent games make them; they were challenging but doable, took some moving about and kept the game adventurous. The bike riding was inventive, rather than a train or car or what have you, and I loved being down by the lighthouse, near the water.

I believe it is one of HER Interactive's best games so far and is the best bet for a Nancy Drew gamer

This has been a good purchase for us.  We are in northern Italy for about 7 weeks, and needed to navigate a number of cities: for several business meetings and just to find our way around.  It has been an invaluable tool.  We have still used physical maps to a certain extent, but in finding the shortest routes, and other points of interest, this has helped us never to be lost (so far!

If you have used MS Streets & Trips, then you'll know your way around AutoRoute.  We are using this to plan a trip to Europe next May.  Based on my knowledge of locations in Britian, the software appears to be pretty accurate.  If you want to use this with a GPS that does not come bundled with the package, expect some frustration.  I still have not figured out how to get it to talk to my USB based Garmin unit.  I think it is possible, just do not know how.

As far as GPS software goes, there is nothing better available than Streets & Trips and AutoRoute.  There are dozens of features that you can't find with the self-contained GPS units.  It is easy to add multiple stops and to optimize them into the best order, night-view is another great feature, as are the topographical maps.  The new feature offered this year, of easy-linking to satellite photos of places on the map, is also a welcome addition.  

The only reason I'm giving it a four is because of the following:

1)  There is STILL no ground-level or 3D view of the roads for use in the GPS function

2)  They still haven't added an option to exclude roads that ban trucks or commercial traffic form using them.

3)  There isn't a lot of coverage for Eastern European countries, most notably, nothing in Russia.

Nonetheless, it is still better than any other GPS software on the market

For those already familiar, I was excited about this edition when it was advertised that it now works with RAW files.  This one of the advantages that Adobe Photoshop Elements has.  I have a Nikon Digital SLR and I often shoot in RAW and have to convert to .jpg if I want to edit with Microsoft Digital Imaging.  When I went out to buy this "Anniversary" edition, in very small print it reads that it's the same as the previous 2006 edition "except" support for RAW files is no longer included.  Still, it was on sale ($24) and I thought an upgrade would be cool.  When I used it, I saw little or no difference in this than the Microsoft Digital Image 10 I had already been using.  In my opinion, upgrading from 10 isn't worth it. 

For those new to this product, let me start by saying, I've been a long time user of Microsoft's digital imaging products.  I enjoy the bright, clean look of the interface.  More that that, I love how simple it is to use.  I would recommend Microsoft Digital Image to all skill levels, but especially anyone who's just starting out in Digital Photography and computers.  Hands down, it's the easiest.  It does in one step what would take three Photoshop Elements.  You sacrifice come control, but simplicity is the focus of this program.  Adobe Photoshop Elements is more powerful, but harder to use.  Bottom line is, if you want to concentrate on getting out and taking good pictures instead of spending lots of time editing, get Microsoft Digital Imaging.  For the average shutterbug, It'll edit just as good as Photoshop Elements in less time and for less money.

I have the older version which was great but doesn't seem to work on WIN XP. Both do a great job especially when you need an emergency card. 2006 edition has a great added feature of being able to choose the size format for your card, big plus. The graphics are nice and there are many choices. It's a good deal at the price

Learn Catalan is a fun activity and a good learning experience for those with no spanish base; however, i have taken about 5 years of Spanish and found the CD to be fairly basic, and while catalan differs in many ways, many of the things they teach are not as useful as i would hope.   There are a lot of items and phrases neccessary to be a tourist.   I definitely have benefitted from this CD because i can hear the way the language is pronounced and become more absorbed in it.  Overall, great for beginners, and only slightly helpful for someone with spanish knowledge

AV materials for Catalan are very difficult to find.  But Catalan is certainly worth investigating, and this makes for a highly pleasant intro.  Now if only Eurotalk would come up with a second CD

Remember....this is a software program and may require you to purchase appropriate hardware to compliment!

PRO's: Easy to install, somewhat intuitive to use. Up and running in no time. Imports Digital Video fairly simply. Speed of production is directly related to your equipped home computer. Stability of program is strong point. Does what it says it can do. Didn't make any coaster on first attempts to use. Finish product runs well on all DVD players.

CON's: Needs more style templates. Needs an imbedded sound translator for music track imports. Steeper then normal learning curve with less then optimum manual explanations

I've only just begun using this software, but have not found it to be so easy to use for a novice at film editing or to make a slideshow. I would have liked to have seen better and more tutorials. I find the tutorial confusing. So far I have been able find most of the answers to my questions through the Help section, but it just isn't as straight forward as I would have liked. I purchased this b/c it was rated so high by PC Magazine. I'm sure in time I'll learn the software better, but it just seems more challenging and not as easy to learn as most sofware I have taught myself to use.

Simple and Great video editing software considering it is for the normal and home user. I would say it is the beginner to Intermediate user tool. I can really create fast movies very quickly. 

Pros:
Easy to install
Easy to split/edit Home videos
Compatible with iLink
Support for High Definition HDV Camcorders
Competitive price

Cons: 
User Interface can be confusing at the beginning to understand and placement of workspace windows.

Rendering is slow.

I do a pretty good bit of video production. I have used let's say most of them in the quest of finding a video editor that would do the real things I need. Ulead Video Studio 10 Plus is pretty good, but it lacks in the audio section. Pinnacle: not worth the bucks I paid for it at Best Buy. Magix: nice but seriously lacking the depth needed in the audio section.
I had used Premiere Pro before and liked a lot of the features provided in it but the price, my god, was just too much. I found Premiere Elements on Amazon and hoped that it would do the job. It did.
Elements 3 has almost and I say almost features as does Premiere Pro. Some features have been streamlined for the amateur but learning to use Elements has been fun and productive. 
I would recommend Adobe Premiere Elements 3 to any intermediate to advanced video editing person

There is no other product which compares to the Microsoft Office suite. "Microsoft Office Standard Edition" is the place to get started. And it is the place you'll probably stay.

You do need Word and Excel, and occasionally, PowerPoint. Learn basic word processing and spreadsheet usage. Shine in meetings with PowerPoint.

Do you need to upgrade from XP? Not likely. There are no new features I found impressive after having the XP version for years.

It lacks Access, but most people don't need the database strength of it, and will survive nicely with just Excel.

For e-mailing documents and files to coworkers, you can be confident they'll easily open Office files. There is a good chance they use it themselves.

Outlook is one of those highly underrated, but enormously useful applications to help you organize your contacts, schedule and tasks easily. You can use it as an e-mail reader as well, though that feature has been vulnerable to viruses.

Word is a huge program which can do far more than you'll need, but it will allow you versatility and simplicity that WordPerfect has yet to pull off.

Excel is a basic spreadsheet with incredible math functionality. I don't need most of the math tools, other than minor budgets and such. I find it handy for tracking my poetry submissions; I can see which magazine I sent which piece to when, and how and when they replied.

PowerPoint makes those cool slideshows with the text that can be animated on the screen. With the templates, you can look good without requiring a graphic design degree.

I fully recommend "Microsoft Office Standard Edition." It is the business and home office standard. You need it, it is easy to learn, and the price is right.

I have used Synmatec products for many years and have been fairly pleased by them.  However, don't buy the upgrade or renew your subscription until AFTER your current subscription runs out because Synmatec will not give you credit for the un-used portion of your previous subscription.  I asked and they said "no way".  That aspect of "customer service" is very disappointing

I installed Norton Antivirus 2007 immediately after installing Windows Vista, Office 2007 and other software on a new computer.  Installation ran smoothly.  LiveUpdate ran automatically and updated the product without a hitch.

Norton AntiVirus 2007 not only detects viruses, it detects spyware and rootkits as well.  It has an inbound firewall, and apparently some limited outbound firewall capabilities.  It does not protect against phishing, identity theft, or spam, nor does it contain full outbound firewall protection.

When installed on Windows Vista, Norton Antivirus takes over for Windows Defender and the Windows Firewall.  I did not expect the latter; Symantec should have made it more clear that this product includes a software firewall.  Norton AntiVirus integrates well with Windows Security Center.

Norton AntiVirus 2007 is noticeably quicker both in normal operation and during full scans than previous versions. Norton AntiVirus has always performed well in industry comparisons against other antivirus products. The only other product that I would use myself is McAfee VirusScan, but I have always felt that Norton AntiVirus does a more aggressive job of protecting my system.

For those of you installing Norton AntiVirus 2007 as an upgrade, I would highly recommend that you first remove any existing Norton security products using Add/Remove Programs in the Control Panel.  Then, download and run the  Norton Removal Tool from the Symantec site to make sure that it's all gone.

To see a comparison chart of the Norton 2007 Windows protection products as of this posting date, browse to Symantec's site, click on "Norton 2007 Products" under Home Products, click on related link "View All Products" and then click "Compare" next to PC Security.

I have not spent tons of time working with the program yet, but have done enough to know that the learning curve is reasonable if you are somewhat publishing program literate. It has lots of potential for aiding in visualizing what your project will look like finished. If you are willing to invest some time to learn the program features, it performs as promised

I was a little skeptical about this program  - until I tried it last evening for the first time. I am really impressed.....  I did not even use the tutorial before I dove in and tried to play a bit.  I created a single room in less than 3 minutes, using simple walls, doors, windows, and a fireplace.  Adding flooring and coloured walls was so easy it was almost sinful!  LOL

I am most anxious to do more with the program and learn about all its capabilities.  Today I watched the tutorial and was really surprised at how much this program can do!  

I am entering into an interior design program in January 06 and wanted to "play" with the CAD software in advance.  I was really happy and impressed with the simplicity of the Better Homes and Gardens version as the idea of CAD seemed intimidating.  Not any more....

I whole-heartedly recommend this program to everyone who is considering designing their interiors or for students of interior design who have not yet attempted any CAD programs.

Impressed with the way it clears out viruses, spyware, and Trojans---I can look at what it's doing or just let it do it. That all goes well. What I don't like is it requires a password for everything even my usual automatic sign-me-in sites and I can't figure how to change this. So the instructions are not as specific as would be helpful

I tested numerous anti-virus programs after getting fed-up with previous Norton Anti-virus, which would always "hang" my incoming email, causing me to redownload larger files and sometimes make it impossible to retrieve them at all. (Incidentally, this had nothing to do with the "time-out" settings.) 

After testing other top rated anti-virus programs, the only one that wouldn't "hang" large email files, was Kaspersky. Even though I have my "time-out" set to only 1 minute, Kaspersky never stumbles and lets go, even if it takes much more than 1 minute to download.

I also like the easy to use "pause protection" when I'm doing file clean-ups, because there's no sense passing temporary files through a second time, and it speeds the clean-up 5 times faster

I am not a computer geek or techie at all, most software and hardware changes always make me hold my breath and cross my fingers.  I recently purchased the Kaspersky Anti Virus based on the review of it in Consumers Reports.  It installed easily, updates automatically and frequently.  Very satisfied with it.

I have got a virus that cause files "comment.htt" appeared in many folders and my previous antivirus can detect them but can not destroy that virus. I tried to use another 2 antiviruses but not effective. So I try KAV and it works! Also KAV does not slow my computer like some big-named antivirus. Autoupdate feature is cool. We do not have to click anything and the prize is reasonable

This is one program that in my opinion you get more than what you pay for I have several Immaging programs that I use for several different things. This one is a delight to use and does a great job taking most of the work off the user. Its a microsoft program that is very user friendly and easy to use. However you do have to be some what computer savy, (like know where to turn on the computer kind of thing) not like some of the 1 star comments that were made here by other folks. I would recomend it to all people that need a simple to use program. Its not what you pay for something its what you do with it after you get it

Not sure how I got it, but I got a browser hijacker that adaware and spybot wouldn't get rid of.  On top of that I got a trojan that these programs and my avast antivirus wouldn't get rid of.  So out of desperation to do something quickly, I went to B.Buy and bought this for $40.  They didn't have a large selection, so I put down the money for it.  Imagine my  feeling when I saw it on amazon for $20.  Still this product works well.  It made me uninstall spybot, adaware, and  turn off my windows firewall to install it.  You can install it on 3 different computers, or it asked you to switch your license from one of them, should you install it a fourth time.  So you can install it more than 3 times, you jsut have to switch your lisenses..understand?  Product works very well and got rid of my problems.  You get updates for 1 year, and then you have to renew.  I think this is stupid personally, but its the Trend now days.  Its a rip...you pay $40 for spyware or virus protection and it should be good for more than a year.  Several annoying windows pop up from time to time asking me what I want it to do.  I wish there was some default user setting so the program could do it.  The firewall slows down your connection, but they all do.  I have 3MG DSL and my speed test are down around 1300K, so I've lost alot of bandwith.  I guess its worth the protection.  Before with spybot and adaware, the spyscans would typically find 25+ issues of spyware.  Now with Trend Micro, I find only 5 to 10 issues on my weekely scan.  So I'm happy with the product, except for my decrease in DSL speed

I have been using PC-Cillin after dumping McAfee following some lousy customer support with no issues. This new version I was very concerned after reading all of the reviews. It does seem to slow things a little on my AMD PC if I am running all of the options I can run but even with them it is tolerable. I am sure you would not want to run this on anything less but it does work and managing it has been simple.

I have used this anti-virus since 2000, I liked it then, and I love it now.
If your the type of user that does not want to worry about your computer on the internet, this is for you.
It can be a pain on older computers that have less RAM, but it still gets the job done. 
Now the cons, I had 3 experiences with customer service, and 2 were postitive, and 1 was negative. I'm not throwing the baby out with the bath water, although I wanted too.
The woman was extremely rude, to the point that I contacted the corporate office.
In the end I did renew my subscription.

I had no idea how easy it is for exe programs, and the such to change settings on your computer allowing attacks. This software lets you know when your settings have changed as soon as they get changed.
For 20.00 how can you go wrong!

Switched from Panda Anti-Virus to this one.  Great software, very sensitive settings.  It was quite aggrevating at first getting constantly interrupted in other programs to be told of various things going on.  Finally got each feature individually adjusted to settings I can live with, and it works great.  They could improve the filtration time (long) to analyze your computer (I only have a 40gig HD with about 20gig used) as it takes about 20-25 mins. to do the complete cleansing process.  However, first time I ran it after having run Panda for the last time, it caught 2 undetected trojans Panda missed.  It also isolated a hidden file trying to access the internet for "updates" that I still have not been able to identify, but it's zapped.  Overall, best I've seen so far, and you can install it on up to 3 computers from one cd (just name each installation with a different username to accomplish, all perfectly legal with the 3 User CD deal).  I have 3 laptops covered at a cost of about $13 each - I'll take that all day long

My feelings are...if you have simple income, not a lot of financial dealings, this program will walk you thru your returns with no difficulty. I've only done Fed & State with 2 incomes, 1 home, with all the associated deductions and the program handled everything. Using the program is a snap and it saves me about $200-300 over using a tax preparer, who asks me questions just like this program does. You simply need to sort out all your receipts, etc., the same as you need to do for a live preparer

Bought this primarily for my TIVO set, so I could transfer and burn DVD's from my  TIVO box. Once I hooked up my mac G5 to the TIVO box, Toast worked perfectly. Easy interface, fast transfer, easy to burn. It's nice to know that TIVO supports Mac. A great product!!

I love Toast, and have had it since version 3.  Don't have TiVO, so can't comment on usability, but for everything else it works better than software that comes with Mac.  Can't wait to try double-density and Blu-Ray, with which this is compatible.  Even earlier versions could burn more different kinds of media than the burn software that came with the Mac.  A friend of mine just switched from PC to Mac, and this was the first software that I suggested he buy.  As another reviewer said, if you have Toast, you don't need Popcorn.  The best!!

I was a little leary about purchasing this product, having never tried anything like it before and being fairly new to the computer world.  I was delighted to find how easily the Toast 8 system worked for me.  The owner's manual is VERY specific, and while I am still discovering all the capabilities of this software, I have found it to be extremely useful.  I recommend this product very highly

I am very excited about the additions to Toast 8.  I am still learning how to use all of them.  The connection with TiVo is one of the most exciting new items.  I have connected and reviewed Tivo recordings through Toast.  I have not had an opportunity to use toast for a DVD yet.

This product is great.  It is simple to use and offers everything you need to do cd and dvd recording.  The addition of tivo to go transfers and dvd menus make this product a true winner.  The only problem I have encountered is the length of encoding recordings from tivo to burn them to dvd.  If you need to record audio or video to cd or dvd this is the product you need.  Don't wast time with anything else

I purchased Elements because frankly,I couldn't afford the whole big Adobe enchilada.I have found it to be pretty intuitive.Lots and lots of options as to organization,photo-tweaking and such. I have had a lot of fun messing around with the program and my digital photos.
I do have two other imaging programs,and with the addition of Elements,I feel like I'm basically well-set with zillions of options.Plus,there are several web sites dedicated to digital photography,and they supply free downloads of Photoshop samples, such as "textures," and so on.Very helpful.
Get this if you can't spring for the complete Photoshop program. You will not be disappointed

I wanted to see if I could do all the essential digital image editing "on the cheap" in PSE5...and I am satisfied that I have been able to do just that.

The best companion book I've seen to assist in that effort is this one:
Adobe Photoshop Elements 5.0 Maximum Performance: Unleash the Hidden Performance of Elements by Mark Galer.
 
The combination of the PSE5 software and book proved to be perfect for me, and as near as I can tell, I can now do all the image editing I need to do, at a fraction of the cost and time required for the full-on Photoshop product. I'm very satisfied with my purchase. If you're on the fence about it, I'd recommend downloading the 30 day trial version from the Adobe website prior to purchasing

Good product; however, I don't understand why it requires lengthy updates 
every time I open the program.  

Perhaps they should try to get it right the first time.  And it's impossible to tell whether the updates do anything for me.

Using it with Quicken is a PITA.

It is unclear to me how you get more than one state

I had read a lot of reviews (here and elsewhere) warning of Final Cut's massive learning curve, and I do believe that helped soften the blow when I first tried this program. Because there definitely is a learning curve--this is far more complex than iMovie. But, the good news is, it's not beyond the newbie's reach!

I'm such a newbie with anything video, it's pitiful. I have only made two or three small movies in iMovie, and they weren't very sophisticated. I mostly just tinkered around. But, being the fool that I am, I decided that I wanted to get Final Cut Express to go along with the new camcorder I had just purchased.

Because I was prepared to have to re-learn (or struggle) at first with Final Cut, I had purchased a book (for version 2 of FCE, which was perfectly suitable). Armed with my book and limited expectations, I set about trying to make a fun little "music video" (using video clips and still pictures). Amazingly enough, I learned how to do the "Ken Burns Effect" with the pictures, make transitions from one clip to the next, edit the sound so that one track would predominate for part of the video, then fade out for other parts. And I was able to fix the video clips (zoom in, lighten, change aspect ratio). And then I added titles with LiveText. All this in the first two days of using Final Cut!  Sure, the little video I made was no award-winner, but it was actually a servicable, fun little project that I wasn't too ashamed to show my friends.

(Another thing about fixing the aspect ratio of one of the video clips--there was this one clip that seemed resistent to any tweaking or adjusting that I tried with it. I had used multiple programs to try to resize it to the correct dimensions, but something always went wrong. Either the picture quality degraded terribly, or else the corrected dimensions didn't "stick" and it bounced back to being distorted. Nothing worked--until Final Cut. I'm sure that other programs could have done the same thing, but I tried so many, and failed. So that was another thing that impressed me!)

I know there's a whole lot more to learn about Final Cut, and I certainly don't anticipate that I'll become a master at it. But it does offer *a lot* more flexibility than iMovie, and it is definitely a lot of fun. 

The right way to approach it is, I believe, to start small, expect baby steps at first, have fun, and GET A BOOK! A book is absolutely essential. If you are an impatient soul who expects perfection the first day, this is not the application for you. Because you learn to "do it manually," you have much more control--but it takes time to learn it all.

Oh, a note about hardware: I made my first little video on a 1.25 GHz G4 Mac Mini with 512 megs of RAM. It wasn't a speed demon by any means, but because my video was short (about 2 minutes), it really wasn't too painfully slow most of the time (except for rendering, but I guess that was going to be slow anyway). I have since upgraded the Mini to 1 GB of RAM, and *everything* is snappier, so I highly recommend it. But it's good to know that even a little Mac Mini with less-than-impressive RAM can work in FCE.

OK, it is big (4 CDRs).  And a full install will require over 2.35 GB.  But it loads quickly and offers nice greeting card variety along with pretty sophisticated card customization options on all pages of the card.  

As in previous years, it also installs Event Planner. If you don't want to use Event Planner you can stop it from starting with Windows by going to START / ALL PROGRAMS / Startup group and deleting the entry for Event Planner from the STARTUP group but if you don't have a similar program, you might find Event Planner to be useful.

I found setting up this program for my auto-duplexing Ricoh color laser printer easy enough to do, so setting it up for other printers will likely be pretty easy also. 

The quality of the printed cards is really astounding, even my normally "picky" wife thinks they look very nice and acceptable for any use. I suppose your results could depend on your printer but if your printer currently prints nice graphics and pictures, then the cards should turn out very nice. I recommend using heavy card stock for a professional looking final product. 

Cards that default to printing out in the 1/4 sheet size (four fold) format can easily be printed at 1/2 fold size and the graphics and text remain outstanding. 

I never experimented with the "partial install" that would require disk swapping but save HD space, so I cannot if that would be a nuisance or not.  

Overall, there is nothing I've found about the program that I don't like.

I have used WordPerfect and Quattro almost from their inception, so I have seen both of them improve over many years. Those years of practise have resulted in WordPerfect Office X3, a really outstanding product.

Because many other organizations and people that I work with use MS Word and MS Excel, in the past I have had no choice but to grudingly use them in response. Now, however, WordPerfect and QuatroPro can translate Word and Excel, incoming and outgoing. Therefore, I no longer have to maintain two Office programs. 

Many years of using WP Office have probably prejudiced me, but I find it more user friendly than MS Office; however, the biggest difference is that Corel is responsive and helpful whereas MS is almost impossible to deal with

I like WordPerfect much better than Microsoft Word as it is easier to use.  Reviel codes solves a lot of problems when text wont behave. Not available in Word. I bought the X3 version because of some bad bugs in ver 12., like not being able to export my address book without errors and mail merge problems. The price was right on Amazon and it was easier that trying to fix 12. I don't see a big difference between the two versions except that they fixed all the problems that I was having in 12. If an earlier version is working for you, I see no good reason to upgrade.

this software is more then what is needed for the average person. it also comes with some free download for installing the software in your computer which you can install on all three computers. it come with lots of template that you can used.

I've always preferred WordPerfect to Word.  I find it is easier to use, more intuitive, and allows more control over documents.  It is less buggy, and I have yet to find one thing that Word does better than WP.  This new version of WP is even better than the old, and I can use it more now because it seamlessly converts documents to and from Word.  

Word users should find this version especially easy to switch to, since it can be made to look and act like Word (though why anyone would want that, I don't know).  Underneath the surface, though, it is still WP, which means it is stable, you can see codes in your document and manipulate them, and it won't do things like decide when you put a number somewhere that you are making a list and start indenting and doing other weird things you don't want and can't control.  

I have been using WPX3 heavily since I got it, but I still haven't used all the features.  I am especially looking forward to trying its PDF conversion function.  I also haven't used any of the other programs in the suite yet, but if prior versions are any indicator, they will also be easy to use and powerful.

I've been using Wordperfect for about 25 years and it keeps getting better.  It is the best word processor by far.  So many things are better than Microsoft's word processors.  Importing graphics, mail labels, and especially reveal codes to name a few.

I remember the first time I used WordPerfect, and the first time I used Microsoft Word.  I couldn't imagine why anyone would choose the vastly inferior Word over WordPerfect.  

Years passed, and now I find myself using MS Word every day.  I'd been ground down by the thousands of Word users who'd picked it up along with PowerPoint and Excel, and who didn't have enough savvy to know how to convert documents from one format to another.  WordPerfect _always_ converted MSWord docs.  MSWord never reciprocated.  Shouldn't that have told them which program had a mandate to make the customer's life that much easier?  With each successive iteration, WordPerfect introduced some new innovation, and in the next incarnation, Microsoft aped it.  It got to the point where users would nod appreciatively at the innovation, then wait the inevitable year-long interval for Microsoft to catch up, and then they'd buy that.

Well, due to an outrageously fair price point and multiuser license, I tried WordPerfect X3, and it was like coming home.  It's nothing short of amazing.  I went out and bought a copy for my parents, and they love it, too.  Now my brother, an attorney, has asked me to buy him a copy, since so many of the federal prosecutors he works with have WordPerfect only, and can't seem to open his Word files.  The more things change, the more they stay the same

I find MS's Expression Web to be a huge step up for the professional web designer from FrontPage.  FrontPage 2003 was extremely nice and very usable by informal web developers, but the code view really wasn't much better than notepad (...not that I have a problem with notepad!).  [...]  I highly recommend it for the professional web designer

A good product but like a lot of Microsoft releases, not everyone outside of Microsoft is ready for it.  Check with your web hosting service first to be sure they support sites developed with Expression Web.  That is a problem I have run into.  In fact some hosting services that support Front Page, haven't even come to full support of Front Page 2003 let alone Expression Web. You could end up changing hosting services to take full advantage of this product and its features

Compared to FrontPage and its infamous "bots", Expressions Web is a refreshing piece of software from Microsoft that out-DreamWeavers DreamWeaver.  As a long time DreamWeaver user, the ability to easily stay in design mode in Expressions Web while building your user interface without the incredible futz-factor that DreamWeaver imposes is its greatest strength. This is a very impressive, stable product that I plan to use a great deal in my non-.net web development work. It makes building and maintaining pure html web sites and newsletters much easier and more intuitive than ever

I have been using FrontPage 2003 and decided that Web Expression Web was the next stage in my website building hobby.  It was easy to install, and I can still use FrontPage 2003 on my existing websites. No need for FrontPage extensions which will be a plus on one of the server hosts I use.  Also bought "Using Microsoft Expression Web" by Jim Cheshire. An excellent book.  Still have much to learn, but looks like fun

The only problem that I had,was loading the actual program on the three computers that I have.You had to delete your old Norton AntiVirus 2006 before starting.Also I have one more problem that after I loaded the Norton AntiVirus 2007 - 3 Users on the last computer I still get a error that I need to down load the latest updates,which I already did

This is the 3 copy version of Norton  AV.  (one CD will create three copies) I purchased it to save money as it was less than $20 per copy.  I bought it to replace NAV 2006 on the same three computers which had expired.

Installed easily on two machines.  Just the uninstall of 2006 and the install of 2007.   

The first machine was more difficult.   There is evidently some conflicting software on the computer as i had to use msconfig for a "Clean boot" per Norton web site instructions .  I kept running into the "blue screen of death" on the previous installs when i would get to the actual install of the Norton AV.  Each time i would have to uninstall the program and do more.   But all of the help came from the Symantec (norton) website.  It is now working fine.

Added:
My personal preference is to not use software firewalls.  I use a router with NAT as a hardware firewall. (It only blocks unauthorized incoming malware)  Software firewalls try to tell you about everything leaving your computer and generally you either become paranoid or just shut the thing off.   They are intended to look for malware by behavior.  Antivirus programs look for malware by signature.  The only advantage to finding malware by behavior is if the computer is attacked in the first day or two of the malware's existence.  If one has an antivirus program it will eventually (within a few days) find the problem that the software firewall was trying to tell someone about. (assuming they haven't given up yet with too many cries for wolf).
So the only software firewall i have (Microsoft OS firewall) is turned off and thus i haven't had the same problem as others report. 

As a practice i sent junk email directly to the trash can and avoid weird websites.  So far no problems with malware.

I do television editing for my church and I dabble alittle at home. I have many editing programs that I use for music and video editing of home movies from cams and 8mm.I had nero 6 and it was ok, but nero7 ultra (enhanced) has taken the place of all the other programs. It is my primary editing suite for music and videos. for music I can make changes to songs for skating programs where I would have to send out to have words removed or create a cd for pleasure.This program is remarkable, there are still somethings I have not yet used, this was the best but in this type of program for under $800.00 that is how much the programs that we use in the studio starting price is. Buying this program will be a great investment.

Nero 7 the original version was useless in that it prevented you from burning some things; mysteriously Nero had suddenly undone itself. All of that has now changed with the new update. It is so good that you can now burn ANYTHING on Vista.

Nero Inc also released a "Nero 7 cleantool" for removing bad installs. If you have had trouble with Nero 7 on Vista then the cleantool will fix it. Apply the tool. Clean install. 

Nero 7 is 99.9% effective but has a tendency to corrupt now again simply because it has a vast configuration system. Nero is a core burning tool. This means that several backup packages out there will actually find Nero on install and use it for burning. One example is DVDshrink that runs Nero in the background while backing up DVD movies on DVD-R. I/O errors with these programs, including DVD Decrypter, are usually the result of a configuration problem with Nero. One example is updating your firmware. Sometimes this requires you to reinstall Nero. This problem however is the only bug I have found with Nero. Just on the side - I highly recommend either Sony, Imation, Memorex, Verbatim as relatively cheap good second class media (80% or higher burn success rate). DVD is still in its early days of development and some media is garbage so don't blame Nero if you make coasters (half burned DVD-R Discs that are useless to you) with this software. I also recommend a healthy supply of at least 3 DVD-RW Discs for TESTING your burning so that you NEVER make a coaster and waste money. Okay, now back to Nero. 

Nero Burning Rom is the real tool in the bundle. It is the most configurable burning tool in the package while Nero Express is for those who do not know a thing about burning and works like a Wizard. A word of advice is to stick with the Rom and learn it without using the Wizard. You can choose from dozens of CD formats and dozens DVD formats, including several variations of each format. Image burning and hybrid discs of any time are all here. There is not a disc format you cannot burn with this program. Burner hardware based error correction systems in conjunction with the Nero software make a perfect burn almost every time. Nero also happens to be extremely fast, if not the fastest out there, however fast is also in terms of how fast your burner is, but the software package requires little to no processing before a 8GB DVD is being pulled onto your HD. You can create ISOs with Nero and even use Nero to open up ISOs so you can read the content). There is an amazing amount of free software out there that uses this burner as their base and rightly so. It is the best burning software out there at this time of writing. 

Pros: 

- If you can learn tutorials for all types of backups then this and a DVD burner will change your life if you play games and watch movies. 
- Solid performance. With good hardware and media almost flawless burns every time. 
- Nice configuration. Can even backup your PS and Xbox Games. 
- All burning formats. 
- About 266mb in size. 


Cons: 

- Let's face it. DVD burning and backup does have a bit of a learning curve. Read plenty of tutorials that use Nero to do specific backups. 
- Corrupts sometimes and needs cleaning before reinstall. 
- You really need a top of the range machine to backup a DVD in less than an hour

I previously had Nero 6 and it had tons of bugs for me. I upgraded to 7 ultra enhanced when I upgraded my computer to Vista premium, and I was pleasantly surprised. Everything I have tried so far has been flawless.
It seems that different systems have different results with Nero. For example some people say Nero 6 works best for them, but on my old system it was horrible (running on win2k).
It's complicated software though, so people should give Nero a break.
Overall they do a great job. Just download the trial first and see how it runs on your system.

Great product, has more features then just CD/DVD burning, system backup, numerous audio recording, editing features, lightscribe and it's also Vista compatible. The only downside is it's learning curve some features and options are complex, but once mastered you will be more then pleased with this product.

I used this unit to calibrate my Mitsubishi WD65732 DLP HD TV and was surprised at how good the picture looks after the adjustment. I first went through the tv manual to make sure I understood all the various adjustments the tv makes and wrote them down on a spreadsheet so I could study them and make sure I knew how the language related to the SpyderTV adjustment language. Once I did that and marked down the adjustment ranges, it was a breeze to run the software and make the adjustments. It even creates a pdf file at the conclusion for record purposes and future comparisons. Some of the adjustments for color temperature were surprising, but the bottom line is that the picture looks great

After going insane with the new version of Norton Systemworks 2005, which doesn't even install, I decided to finally swear off all Symantec products. 

I have used Zone Alarm Pro for some time. It's not perfect, but it certainly will protect your computer. I took the plunge and went with the full security suite this week, and I've been relatively happy.

On the plus side, the software works really well. The personal firewall is better than any you can find, and the virus protection found a phishing app that Norton had not (before I had unstalled it).

On the minus side, the firewall can be problematic. I've had page load issues on Ebay and on my own site which has a cgi script to keep my images and files from being hotlinked (bandwidth theft). When I visit my site or any other that has a similar anti-theft cgi script, the images simply won't come up. Ebay gets all messed up as well. I haven't been able to figure out a setting that works, so I have to turn off the firewall on Ebay and a few other sites, which kind of defeats the purpose of a firewall. This doesn't happen a lot though, so it's not annoying enough to get my dander up.

All in all it's been a far better investment than Symantec products, so despite its limitations I would recommend this program. It does have a lot of options to set, but they are pretty easy to get through if you are computer literate.

If you decide to go with this program and you currently have Norton Antivirus, you will need to uninstall Norton before this program will run.

If you were to ask me if I preferred Symantec Systemworks or Zone Alarm Security Suite, there would be absolutely no hesitation in recommending Zone Alarm.

Between high school and college I have studied French for three years and I had been convinced that I would starve to death in Paris trying to understand the menu and to then get myself understood.  Much of that has changed not that I am half way through the Rosetta Stone program.  My ear is now tuned to the language. I have a visceral feeling for the grammar and an ability to discern tenses.  My vocabulary still needs to get stronger, but now that I can distinguish individual words in a stream of French, that is only a matter of practice with the language.  As advertised, this program is painless and progress is rapid.  Try the demo, you'll see.

The immersion process is the only one that works, and this product is a first rate immerser, making the study painless, even immensely pleasurable as one realizes he/she is coming to "own" a new language and perspective. In working with students it is the best "head start" method that I know of, comparable to one-on-one study for at least a year with an accomplished tutor. Unlike less effective methods, it quickly achieves the essential purpose of deeply internalizing the language if one does each of the processes thoroughly. Of course continued study, especially in acquiring vocabulary, is necessary, just as it is for those acquiring a native language - the study of any language is ongoing.

I would give this program 50 stars if that option were available.

If you look at my review history, you may note that I've given very few five-star reviews. I save five stars for outstanding products. I believe Wordperfect X3 is best described as outstanding.

A long time ago, I used Word Perfect. However, my earlier jobs required I use MS Word, so I did my best to become a Word guru. I believe I accomplished that short of creating custom macros. As a law clerk, I started a new job where WordPerfect was the standard.

So, last year I bought WordPerfect 12. At first it was difficult, but I bought a book that helped me fill in the blanks. With the ability to customize keyboards and the fact that WordPerfect gives the author a great degree of control (especially with show-codes), I was soon able to become a WordPerfect guru. I remembered all the things I used to love about WordPerfect. Like any lover, I also learned to ignore some of the blimishes of WordPerfect. (One of those blemishes is the behavior of pushing a change from that point of the document forward, which, once you get accustomed to it, is really a nice feature.) Wordperfect and PDFs are the two accepted file formats for electronic submission to Federal courts.

There were two complaints I found at work among Word devotees: 1) the ability to export to PDF but not import and 2) the inability to cut from a Word document into a WordPerfect document without creating all the formatting litter Word likes to use.

1. We occasionally receive PDFs that we would have to retype to be able to make edits. With the ability to import PDFs (that is, those that were authored and exported into PDF, not documents scanned into PDF), we were now able to edit those PDFs. This was a real time saver. Since PDF is the de facto universal standard amongst all platforms (Windows, Mac, Unix), this was a great improvement.

2. Formatting litter is a real pain to deal with. I never could get a MS Word document to just import into WordPerfect without headaches in trying to fix the formatting. My solution was to copy the portion out of MS Word, paste into a text file, copy again and then paste into WordPerfect. My complaint was I could not just straight paste into WordPerfect. Well, Corel heard my cry and provided the ability to copy just the text. The lone MS Word holdout in my office capitulated with that. He has no more to complain about.

Another great thing about WordPerfect is the fact that the file format for its documents has not changed in years (I heard a WP rep say no change since 1995). Why should it? Everything you could want to do in a document (perhaps barring professional typesetting) can be done in WordPerfect. There's no need to create a new format when the one you have just works.

This product does exactly what those who have come to love WP expect it to do. I think Corel has done a good job of resolving my own personal quibbles with WP.

So, if you're looking for a solid performer that seeks to beat competition by improving itself, WPX3 is representative of what you're looking for

Overall I would highly recommend the Rosetta Stone software even though it's a bit over priced and certainly insufficient as your primary learning method.  Rosetta Stone *combined* with Pimsleur is a great method for languages that are similar to your native language.  The disks are copy protected and that is a serious drawback as you need the CD in the drive any time you are going to use it and you can't use a backup copy for safety.

The Rosetta Stone lessons are quick, easy and fun to do, thus encouraging usage.  If you can afford it I would definitely recommend combining Pimsleur and Rosetta Stone.  Both are excellent products and far better than less expensive products commonly available.  But neither alone is sufficient for effective learning of a language.

Could Rosetta Stone be improved?  Certainly.  More diverse and better graphics would help.  The graphics they use are very good but occasionally a picture isn't quite clear as to meaning.  For example if you are supposed to select "a boy on a horse" you may not realize it is a boy on the horse.

If you are questioning if you should get Rosetta Stone or not, just get a free demo CD from their website and try it yourself.  As far as I can tell the full product is exactly the same as the demo but obviously you have access to more lessons

I purchased this program about 1.5 years ago. I have been casually studying German through other programs for about 4 years. The best basic words-only is through Unforgettable Languages (very basic, but easy as heck to learn). Rosetta Stone is the best for understanding gender, verb usage and adapting to the German style of sentence structure. I absolutely love all the functionality and versatility of the program. It is incredibly challenging to go from reading to typing and to speaking. 
The only negative is that the CD has to be used to run the program. Even with an accelerated CD-Rom, the starting/stopping of the CD is distracting. If that feature were corrected, it would be perfect

This is actually a review for more than one product (Pimsleur and Rosetta Stone)

If you are willing to spend 1-2 years learning a foreign language but have limited time (weekly), lack the ability to immerse yourself in that culture for 1 year (the best way to learn the language), can't attend classes, can expend some budget, and want the process to be challenging yet fun, here's how to do it:

1. Buy a good English-Foreign Language Dictionary.
2. Get the Pimsleur Course for that language. (Check Ebay for used copies)
3. Buy the Rosetta Stone Program for that language. (Costly. Try the online monthly subscription option if your budget is tight.)
4. Get a Basic Grammar Language Book (Barron's highly recommended)

Putting it all together.

1. Listen to the Pimsleur Program during your daily commute-1 lesson per day. (Take the weekend off) DO NOT go to the next lesson until you have a 80% recall of the material. THERE IS NO NEED TO BE AT 100% RECALL before going to the next lesson. (Trust me on this on-avoid my pain)
      Using this method, you can get through ALL Pimsleur lessons (Levels I-III)in 1 year. THE FOCUS OF PIMSLEUR IS SPEAKING SKILLS.

2. At the same time, use the Rosetta Stone lessons on the weekend, with one 30 minute to 1 hour session. Go through the guided exercise followed by the test. THERE IS NO NEED TO GO THROUGH EVERY LESSON (TYPE) for each program. After you buy the product, you'll know what I'm talking about. THE FOCUS OF ROSETTA STONE IS LISTENING SKILLS.  

3. Review the basic grammar of the language as you go through the 2 above.

4. Contrary to what Pimsleur says, look up any words for spelling, and likewise, for Rosetta Stone, look up any words for definition you don't understand. 

Bottomline: Despite what they advertise, these are not stand-alone programs. Also the secret to recall is anticipation, meaning an 80% success rate for Pimsleur is ok and 70% success rate for Rosetta Stone is okay before moving to the next lesson. 

You don't get any extra points for making 100% and this effort can be counter-productive (burn out, boredom, and frustration before finishing the lessons.)

Your goal should be to get through all of the programs and lessons and the experience should be challenging and fun. Afterwards, you can take your trip to that country for the total immersion experience, and after the first 2 weeks, you'll see how well spent your time was with the programs.  

Note: I've used the Japanese, German, and Korean Pimsleur Courses, and Rosetta Stone German and Japanese Programs. I've also spent extensive time in all 3 of those countries. Learn from my mistakes.

Good luck and have fun.

Overall I was pleased with ease of installation. This was an upgrade from Office 2003. I backed up all files before upgrade, and always do this, but it was not necessary for this upgrade. My overall disappointment is Outlook's inability or difficulty to use other mail servers (yahoo, gmail, etc.). The shift appears to favor msn products only (hotmail and msn). No wonder Thunderbird is slowly becoming a favored email application

It seems the last few Office releases I have purchased haven't really offered anything different, but this one does.  The interface is totally changed and takes some getting used to.  I would suggest upgrading to Office 2007 when you have a little time to figure out the new layout and not if you have to jump right into a project.  The new toolbars seem to be really thought out and are very user friendly.  If you aren't into change and prefer the status quo of the standard, File Edit Tools...layout, then this product is not for you.  If you are willing to spend a couple hours getting used the new layout (it's quite easy) you won't be sorry because it's well worth it.

I upgraded form Office 2000 to Office 2007, expecting to see major improvements. I was disappointed. Office 2007 has some enhancements, but it also has some glitches. If I had been able to try it first, I probably would have just stuck with my old version of Office

Office 2007 is a nice step up from Office 2003 (and earlier) as it has better visuals on the toolbar. e.g. Instead of just seeing the worded commands on the toolbar where one clicks on the command and then gets a drop down list to choose from with more commands, i.e. File, Tools, Edit, etc, you'll see tabs with different commands on the toolbar. When clicking on the tabs, it sets up across the toolbar, all of the functions of that particular tab. Once viewed, you not only see the words of the functions, but also, small example graphs and images of what that functions does. This only applies to all the applications other than Outlook, which pretty much retained the same look and feel as 2003

The load times seem to be much quicker than what I had in the 2003 version. In Outlook, setting up accounts, maintaining names and addresses is much easier too. The only annoying part of Office 2007 that comes to mind is, one can only choose from 3 color schemes. The three are "Black" which really looks more like a dark taupe or slate color, "Blue" which looks more like a light powder blue and "Silver", which looks like a light gray. In my honest opinion, I like having the standard color look like previous versions and as my taste goes with this, I only like the black setup only

This is a great product.  It easily performs all the functions a small business needs, if it is to be taken seriously in the marketplace.  I'm impressed at how seamless it integrates all the accounting functions.  Essentially, you never enter information more than once and it always anticipates the most logical next step.  My clients are impressed at receiving e-mailed estimates and invoices that are clear, timely and professional.  This is a must

I bought this for my god-daughter after buying Mia's Science Adventure. I have never been so impressed with a companies product before. You can learn both Spanish AND French on the same CD. The graphics are amazing, the adventure is stupendous and now Lily (my god-daughter) is learning Spanish. Her level is above all her classmates and she's even started conversing with a Mexican girl in our neighbourhood. Well worth your money

This game is great!  After buying Mia Reading I thought it was a great idea to get my 2 girls to start learning Spanish since we live in a global village. They game was easy to load, easy to navigate and the level was perfect for beginners. The high quality 3D animation will blow you away. Even my husband who learned 3D animation at the Vancouver Film School was blown away. The best part is, that they love playing it as they think it is a game. They forget they're learning numbers and vocab and how to put together simple sentences. Well recommended

I have had this only a couple of days and have learned it quickly thanks to the training CD that is included with the program.

Very easy to learn. Great item.

3/23/07,
I have used this program every day and must say I love it. I have used other photo editing software and did not like them much. This is so easy to use, the training CD gets you started and after compleing it (7 chapters) you are ready to fix all the photos you like but are over or under exposed. A powerful program. You can look like a pro using this. 10 stars if I could

Before purchasing this product I did the trial of Photoshop for 30 days and then the trial of this one.  Paint Shop Pro (PSP) won hands down!  While they both have similar features, the learning curve on Photoshop is ridiculous...PSP is so intuitive, you can figure out most of the features on your won, but the help feature is great...side by side help as you click through the menus and buttons.  I was impressed!  The red-eye fix is excellent and flexible, with ability to change to pet eye, different eye colors, WOW, there is just so much and all ready to use out of the box without any complicated aftermarket manuals needed.   I have restored some antique photos with very impressive results.  So far I have not had the instability issues that others cite, but my PC is heavy on the graphics capability and memory, perhaps that helps.

This photo editing software package is unreal.  It has more features and functions than you can shake a stick at.  Right out of the box I began some serious photo editing and got outstanding results.  Beats any other software in it's price range.  I have yet to read the manual or instructions as it intuitive.  Two things - don't even bother with the free version of Snapfire, which is included.  It is redundant with Pro Photo and rather simplistic without much value.  It is included as a teaser to get you to spend more money with Corel by way of an upgraded version.  And unfortunately the software is NOT well behaved and crashes to frequently.  If it were not for this stability issue I would have given it a (5) star rating.  Corel - nice job but get it working better

Like many other long term hobby digital photo fans I have used Paint Shop Pro for more than 10 years from version 4. It has always been a frustration that the programme was written for creating paint type graphics and photos were almost an add on. As Digital photography became more and more a real option the earlier versions of Paint Shop Pro became more of a frustration and I tried everything else. At last Corel Paint Shop Pro Photo feels like it was written for photo editing. It is easy to use with all the assistance a beginner could want, but dig deeper and it will go wherever you want to go, and more. I'm sad to see Paint Shop Album almost redundant, but it is great to have the organiser on tap. It runs on a less than optimal computer system unlike others that are too large and slow for many of us to consider.

I used Paint Shop Pro to help build my website. I really like it and I'm glad I bought it. My favorite part about it is the animation software. You can do great animation or cool banners or even little buttons with cool effects. Because of PSP 9 my website now has animation, buttons and a banner with bright colors and images! I love it! And anyone can use it! I had no experience with PSP or computer art and graphics, but this is pretty simple to use.

Also you can use PSP for touching up and doing other neat things with your photographs. This is great software for doing all this stuff and it's so much cheaper than Photoshop. If you're building a website and want to add color and graphics or if you want do to some photo touch up work, then maybe you want to check out Paint Shop Pro

This is truly the killer application for comic book collectors.  You get the comic's whole run from its auspicious origins in 1961 to its current incarnation at the end of 2004, in a tiny DVD that you can carry anywhere.  The thrill of reading classical issues in all their colored glory is not to be missed, particularly for those not reprinted so far.  I especially enjoyed the Impossible Man and Molecule Man origin stories.  Seeing how particular adventures ended is also great fun, since I owned some comics from the generally undistinguished 1980s, but didn't know how things turned out.  Being able to read the entire John Byrne run of the mid-eighties was spectacular.  It's even better than his work at the X-Men, and almost as cool as the Lee-Kirby years.  This is so much better than the Essentials, since it's in color and so much cheaper, plus it includes the original ads and letter pages.  It also beats the Masterworks series not only on account of price, but also because it has the original colors.  It's as good as owning the complete collection, but it will take up less space and hence will generate less nagging from mothers or wives.  This is a must have item, with perhaps the best price/quality ratio I have ever seen.  Can it be improved?  Sure.  Why not take advantage of the possibilities of computers and create an index of all characters that would allow the reader to see all appearances of a character over the years? Why not create an index of writers and artists, so that one may quickly get a view of their work?  Cross-referencing is the next step the good people at Marvel must be working on.  But there's no reason to wait for that.  Even as it is, this DVD is not just good enough.  It is great, like the Fantastic Four themselves

This is absolutely tremendous!  If you ever owned the original Kirby-Lee Fantastic Four comics, and let them go for whatever reasons, or if you never had them, and want to see the World's Greatest Comic Magazine in the days when it truly lived up to that title, this is the way to go!  No one who's gotten this far should pass it up... it's an unbelievable bargain and a wonderful item in these days of madness like comics slabbed in plastic, like Han Solo trapped in carbonite...

Forget the Marvel Masterworks volumes... the reproduction ranges from shoddy to terrible, and the color is garish.  Those reprints do a great disservice to these classic comics... the originals looked much better than they do in the Masterworks volumes!  An example... Fantastic Four #5... in the Masterworks volume, on the very first page of the very first appearance of Doctor Doom, black splotches inexplicably obliterate most of Doom's mask...there's no excuse for that! That wasn't there in the original, and it's not here in the scan!  

If you don't own the original comics, and aren't wealthy enough to buy the originals, this is the way to go.  The scans are very good, high resolution.  Here, you see all the linework that gets clotted in the Masterworks volumes, and you can zoom in and really study all the details of that great Kirby machinery, otherworldly architecture, and cosmic panoramas!  I've had a big grin on my face from the moment I looked at the first page... this is what comics are all about... pure, unadulterated, cosmic fun!

The original letter pages and ads are a real treat, too... the whole experience is time travel!

Oh, yeah... you also get 34 years of non-Kirby Fantastic Four issues... ;-)

Please note!  If you have a Mac, and are having difficulties with this dvd, here are some tips.

Are you opening it with Preview?  If you just click on the icon on the disk, it will open in Preview... but this will not work properly.  You must use Adobe Reader to see the pages without the watermark.

Install Adobe Reader from the dvd.
Make an alias of Adobe Reader and put it in the Dock.
Click and open the dvd icon.
Click and open the decade folder.
Don't open the year folder... click and drag the pdf icon, (such as FF_1960.pdf), onto the Reader alias in the dock to open.
Click on year.
Click on month.
Click on the magnifing glass icon to zoom to any size.
Enjoy all that cool Kirby machinery bigger than you've ever seen it!

I hope this is helpful

Snapfire and Snapfire Plus are new photo software from Corel. Snapfire was recently released as a free download and Snapfire Plus is a budget priced upgrade which adds more advanced features.

The one thing consumers ask for the most is a photo software that is easy to learn and use. Corel's answer is Snapfire's Message Center. From this one window, you can keep up with the latest news, updates and specials. More importantly, you have easy access to many tips and tutorials.

Snapfire has automated photo downloading from your camera, memory card or CD. Just plug in one of these and the Photo Downloader automatically starts. You can set download options for how it works. Snapfire will automatically rotate your photos when needed, check for and download only the photos added since the last download and automatically delete the photos from your camera after downloading them to the folder of your choice on your hard drive.

Once your photos are downloaded, you can use Quick Review to view photos in full screen mode and use the floating toolbar for tasks such as adding photo information, ratings and captions or starting Photo Fix. Snapfire's Photo Doctor analyzes your photos and makes suggestions for Quick Fix. With Photo Fix, you can pan, zoom and make corrections such as brightness, contrast and focus. Other photo adjustment features, which are similar to those included in Corel's popular Paint Shop Pro, include Fix Red Eye, Rotate and Crop (with a floating toolbar). Other features borrowed from Paint Shop Pro include easy-to-use organizing with Sort by, Search and Calendar Search. Snapfire also has ways to enhance your photos including Black & White and Sepia color effects.

The Photo Tray is a really nice feature which you can use to drag and drop your photos into a common location, grouping them together for a project, emailing to family and friends or printing. Snapfire has a really cool and special way to email photos. Its called Snapfire Show. After you select the photos you wish to send, Snapfire will automatically create a slide-show with built-in transitions, music and motion effects. Your photos are resized and embedded into the body of the email or added as an attachment.

Printing your photos is easy and fool-proof with the built-in layouts including standard 4 x 6, 5 x 7, 8 x 10, 3.5 x 5, wallet size and contact sheets. Snapfire will automatically use your default printer settings or you can change the settings or printer as needed. If you choose to order prints online instead, you can do so with one click of your mouse and the Photo Upload dialog box.

You can also use Snapfire to work with your videos. Just click on a video's thumbnail to view and edit the video in full screen mode. You can even grab a frame from your video and convert it into a photo. For crafters, Snapfire has several built-in project templates for album pages, greeting cards, calendars and collages. Creating a project is as easy as dragging your photos onto the template and using the basic tools to make adjustments, add text captions and position photos.

A trial version of Snapfire Plus (SE) comes packaged with the newest upgrade of Paint Shop Pro Photo XI or can be downloaded from the Corel website

It is user friendly, transparent, and more robust than Trendmicro's or CA's products, both of which slowed my computer and prevented my music websites from working.  For Windows OSes, Onecare is best in my experience.  However, I have not used OneCare's backup feature enough to make  a judgement.  The $49.99 for 3 computers may be okay, but it would be even better if Microsoft offers it for one computer at  1/3 the rate, say at $17/computer per year

wow, this really made a difference in my ability to create professional-looking comics. i have a graphics tablet and the drawing feel is  really good. i think my favorite feature is the tool for making Panels. Plus the tool for doing special effects lines, which is pretty sweet.

i just draw comics for fun, and for this price it is totally worth it. Manga Studio is perfect for publishing a webcomic or adding effects to existing drawings.

I would definitely recommend this software if you like to draw comics or manga

I purchased the mangadebut because i wanted to dabble in tones and inking (which I usually never do, usually I just scan in the sketch and then darken it with a photo editing.) I came to find out that using lines and erasing the sketch makes for a much more clean finished product. Of course, you could acomplish this with MS Paint if you really wanted to. 
One of the main (and only, in my opinion) advantages to this program is the amazingly vast variations of tones available to make your art more interesting. that alone makes it worth the 50 dollars you put into it.

One downside is that this program, because of it's many tones, uses and requires quite a bit of space. When I uploaded it on my laptop,it slowed down significantly. So much so that now I load it when I want to finish a nice drawing and the delete it from the computer again! XD

overall it deserves about 3-4 stars. ^.^

Excellent for the novice. I callibrated three monitors with the spider. Prior to calibration the images were completely different from each other - after I was amazed how close the images were to each other. The process is so simple that even a cave man could do it.

Creating Keepsakes Scrapbook Designer Version 2 Deluxe - This seems to be a nice program, but I have not found much use for it as of yet.  My intention, when buying it, was to use it for scrapbooking but also greeting cards.  I am sure that I will use it in the future as the program has nice graphics and is easy to navigate.  Broederbund products are usually very user friendly

I've used PaperPort 9 for about 3 years, currently running under Win XP. I love it, my wife loves it, I have bought it for my kids, and recommend it to others. A lawyer friend of mine raves about it. I've had no problems with it. (I had to  downlaod and install an upgrade, but more recent production probably has the upgrade already incorporated.) I download bank and credit card statements and other documents to it from the Internet; I store faxed documents in it; I scan checks before I deposit them; I use it to convert documents to pdf so I can e-mail them. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I wish it were more convenient to do a couple of things; maybe V. 10 adds those features, but for the money, V.9 is a bargain. I just wish I had a faster scanner (what do you expect for $60?) so I could get rid of more paper documents. Highly recommended as a start toward the paperless office

It's amazing having the entire history of a comic series at your disposal.  In print format, it would be impossible for most people to own, let alone store, this much comic book history.  You have to adjust to looking at the comics on the screen, rather than holding it in your hands (a large monitor helps), but other than that I highly recommend this entire series of digitized comics.

To be able to go back in time and see how the comics reflect the times, whether they be in the 60's, 70's or more recent years, really shows you how closely comic books reflect pop culture

It is great to be able to read all the avenger comics again. I read them as a kid, but didn't get to read the very beginning. I hope that they bring out more of the comic book characters on DVD. I will buy more

When I was a kid, I religiously read many of the Marvel comics. The Avengers was one of my favorites. In my dreams I would have loved to have read all of the issues, but the expense would have been (WAY) too much. Now, after so many years the opportunity is finally here. I was afraid that my youth would be too far removed to enjoy reading these anymore, but I took a chance and bought this DVD anyway. It was worth it - by a mile. I am enjoying reading each and every issue since the famed #1 as much as I would have as a kid. It will take a long time to get through them all, but I'll enjoy every minute. Stan Lee, thank you for such a simple pleasure. Great stuff for kids of all ages

Ok I gave it 4 stars just for the fact that you cant actually hold them in your hands and read them . I do have them on my laptop so I guess that kinda works. Whats great about it is the price. 30 bucks for 40 years of comics.....get real!!! I did have some install problems at first like others have but when I took the disc out and reloaded it it fixed itself. I think it was a Adobe update but it did it for me so no biggie. My only problem now is when am I going to find time to read all of the issues. Oh and one more thing you can save the disc to your hard drive so you can save it at work and read at lunch without having to bring the disc with you. Highly recomended if you love comics

We bought it 1 month ago to help my almost 6 year's old sun to learn how to play because I didn't know how to play and I couldn't teach him. As a result of this purchase 

1) My sun fall in love with chess and become so good player that I couldn't imagine

2) I (his mom) learned how to play too.
It is so much fun to learn it that I would recommend it to anybody. It worth it every penny I spent. I like everything about this game. Kids will love it 100%.

We purchased this for my 6 year old son and 7 year old daughter since both children have been asking me to help teach them how to play chess the last several months.  While I have been able to get them started, I find that approach used in this software to introduce the game pieces and concepts has allowed their understanding of the game to grow.

Both kids enjoy using this software and, if I would let them, would spend hours at a time using the software.

My biggest issue with the software is the  sound and animation.  We continually have issues with the sound/animation not being in sync or the audio cutting in and out.  We run this on a computer with plenty of processing power, memory, disk space, etc.  It does not bother this kids too much, but I find it annoying.

All in all, a great tool to help my children learn the game.

This is my first review but I just felt compelled to tell everyone about this terrific program. I bought this game when my children were in Kindergarten and second grade. Fritz and Chester's program is so engaging. There are rhymes and chants for each piece's moves as well as for some other "strategy-type" moves. For example, "A knight on the rim is ugly and dim." What a great way to teach kids to keep their knights in-play! This program teaches kids how pieces move and some simple strategies. I would recommend getting Fritz and Chester 2 now since you are going to get it after your kids learn to play! My boys both joined chess teams when they were in first and third grade. Their use of this computer game gave them the advantage to win several chess games in tournaments. Fritz and Chester 2 is also great and my boys, now in third and sixth grade, still play it

This software is focused on learning the rules of the game.  Movement of different pieces and pawns is demonstrated through an assortment of arcade-type games.  There are some decent books for learning chess for beginners, but learning through a computer game program makes it much easier and more fun.

The program doesn't contain any instructions,so some people may find it frustrating figuring out what to do in the beginning. However, there is a symbol in the top right corner, clicking on which brings down the menu at which point navigating becomes a piece of cake.

Just knowing the rules of the game enables one to play chess, but not exactly to win, so the second CD in this series (Learn to Play Chess 2) continues where the first one left off and goes into different tactics and strategies.  

The software is recommended for 8 year-old children and older - kids at heart may have fun learning chess with this program also

I am a chess player myself, so I can endorse this even more. This software is well designed, it can get a little difficult to get to some exercises inside it, but kids can figure it out eventually. My son has improved his play quite a bit even though he takes hints sometimes :), but this is a good software to get the kids started and teach them all the requisite skills to become a chess playe

Registry mechanic is a great registry tool.  It works better than the registry tools included with Symantec System Works.  If you purchase this version at 5.1 you can get a free upgrade to the latest version 6.0 once you register the product.  Try the evaluation and you will see how many registry errors your machine may have that can effect its performance

I bought the datapilot universal pro kit recently and it worked great! My screen broke on my nokia 6102, and i ended up buying a razor. I had some really important numbers on that phone and this program really saved me. Transferred all my numbers from my broken one into my new razor in a couple of minutes. Also, the image editor and the ringtone thingy came in very useful for saving images and sending mp3s to my phone.

The software is easy to install and easy to use.  The "import prior year's return" feature saved time in completing multiple returns .  I completed one return in 10 mins because of this feature. I also discovered the "save as PDF" feature that made it easier to send tax returns to family and friends whom I prepare returns.  I have used tax cut for the last 4 years and it gets better with each year. The premium federal is great for multiple returns with all kinds of schedules

This Bible is wonderful! It's written in language that is easy to understand. Many people give up on trying to study the Bible because the language is so different from the way we speak now. You won't have that problem with the New Living Translation, and the notes are so helpful. Whenever I'm unclear about a verse or the context, I check the notes, and usually they help me to understand the meaning. They also help me to understand traditions of the time and meanings that were implied to the readers of the time. Whether you've been a Christian for 50 years, or you're only thinking of trying to read the Bible for the first time, or you're anywhere in between, this Bible is a great choice

I'm just learning, and this bible is wonderful. It's written in language I can understand (much easier than the King James version), and the commentary brings everything into focus. 
There is so much extra information in this book and the commenters really took care to try to explain so a newbie like me could understand.
The book comes with a concordence also, which is a God-send (sorry about the pun). I've been so engrossed in reading that I haven't even looked at the CD-ROM yet, but I'm sure it will have great information also.
If you want an easy-to-read bible that comes with fantastic study material, this is the right book for you

This is a well done operating system I use the 64bit version and all but just a few of my software titles work without any problems. All my hardware has 64bit drivers. Overall this is a good product and I would buy it again. Because I went from a 32bit O/S to a 64bit O/S I had to boot from the DVD to install it, but I was able to install it using the key without any problems nor did I have to reinstall it afterwards as some website suggest you have to do

I don't know what other people are complaining about. I just installed Vista Ultimate a few days ago and I absolutely love it. No interface lag or any other lag at all. Maybe the people complaining have weak or outdated hardware. Those people need to turn down their settings if their not going to keep their computers on the cutting edge or at least near it. I'm glad Microsoft isn't waiting for people to catch up and are on the cutting edge. I'd rather be the one catching up than the other way around.

I have a Core 2 Duo e6300 overclocked to 2.5Ghz, 2 gigs of ram, a Geforce 7600gt and a Western Digital Raptor 150g HD and Vista Ultimate works flawlessly on my computer. It's not the best computer but it runs flawlessly, I built it myself and all the parts cost me about $850 off the net. I play World of Warcraft among some other games and I haven't seen any problems yet with any games or any of the major software I use as of yet. I've only encountered one problem and that was with my old Soundblaster Live! 5.1 sound card which has discontinued support. No big deal, it was about time to get a better one anyway. Vista is awesome, I love everything about it. It's very futuristic and it is not a simple interface makeover at all like some clueless dummies proclaim.

By the way, I only paid $110 for Vista Ultimate Upgrade off eBay, check there first if you already have an existing OS and want to save some dough

Solid, familiar and dependable.  Although, I wish there was an option to only update the specific income information from the prior year without going through the extensive interview

This is a pretty good product for the price! I've found a few errors on location of addresses, but all in all, pretty good! Just wish Microsoft will offer a commercial vehicle version sometime in the near future. So far, we've had no complaints.

I use Microsoft Streets and Trips 2007 in a laptop computer for navigational assistance anytime I'm traveling to a destination where I'm not absolutely certain how to get there.  In general, I'm pleased with it's performance.  It has saved me from wrong turns many times.  However, the data seems to be as much as five years out of date on many street additions.  GPS tracking on country roads is inaccurate enough to cause constant "Off Route" - "Back on Route" messages as you navigate twists and turns.  I suspect, in that case,  the map data is just not that accurate

Don't listen to the whinnier. If you are serious about improving your focus and memory skills, this helps. You must use this program for 15 minutes everyday or you will be wasting your time and money. It is worth the effort! I noticed immediate results of being able to retain more info and having more focus at work. I also purchased the music CD's produced by the same company. They are helpful as well. I use them at work, at home, and in the car. The Brain Builder Booklet mentions the CD's. If you want to stop looking stupid because you can't remember information or you're tired of getting lost while driving, this will help you

I don't write reviews often but this product is so great I had to share my thoughts on it.  I bought this product because I was going back to graduate school(mechanical engineering so please excuse my grammar) and I wanted an extra boost in brain power.  I have been using this product just about everyday for weeks now and the results are very apparent.  I have noticed two obvious improvements in myself.  

First, I can now navigate a city with ease.  I always knew my short term memory was the limiting factor in my navigation abilities.  Before I'd always forget where I came from, left or right,what street Im on, etc.  I always had people correct me.  Now I am the one leading and its not because I am paying more attention.  Without directly thinking of my orientation I just know where to orient myself(My gf would always correct me, but now Im correcting her).   

The second obvious improvement is my improved speech and listening abilities.  I'd always have trouble fumbling in my speech and understanding people.  But now I feel I can think of what to say more quickly and clearly.  

I have been doing many puzzles this past summer and the combination of that and brain builder really changed my life.  I think more clearly and I can think "better" now. Hard to explain but the "fog has been lifted".  Everything is easier now whether its putting something together or understanding the environment around me.  Also my IQ scores appear to shoot up really high but thats up to debate.   

I just want to say what a great product this is and I highly recommend it to anyone.  Im sure when I start school this fall I'll see a leap in my abilities.

Brain Builder is a series of visual and auditory exercises aimed at improving attention, concentration and memory. This consists of seven exercises, one involving visual reaction speed and accuracy and six memorizing a sting of randomly generated numbers presented audiably or visually in one of three modes--BASE (straightforward) REVERSE (you must give back the string in reverse the order given) and FLASH (visual numbers presented one at a time instead of all at once like BASE) or RANDOM (auditory where you cope with numbers being read at an uneven pace). You are then immediately tested by having to type in what those were. There is no time limit on response. You progress to higher levels--which means memorizing more numbers faster during the viewing or listening--from an initially determined baseline test taken when first starting. Different voices--men, women, adults, and children--read the auditory presentations.  All and all, I found it to be fairly sophisticated and the exercises do seem help even beyond matters of number memorization. The primary shortcoming seemed to be the lack of feedback or coaching other than telling you not to get discouraged and to keep working hard.  Also, the progress summeraries (bar graphs) fail to take into account the higher levels for scoring purposes so day to day comparison of results seems too flat. Overall, I have enjoyed the program and have stuck with it although there are some days I wish for more variety and to do something else than just repeat numbers. What they say about only having to practice about 10 minutes a day--well--I've had to spend more like 30 minutes or more to do enough exercises to feel satisfied with my progress

I've been a Photoshop user since Version 3 and this upgrade is worth every penny.  I upgraded from version 7 and CS2 is clearly a step up.  Upgrading was a no-brainer.  The only negative is Adobe Bridge - I prefer the file browser that PS 7 had but I can live with it.

The floating image windows is also a nice touch - you are no longer confined to the PS main window.

All of my add-ons worked perfectly including FITS Liberator and the PTLENS suite

This upgrade installed easily with my Photoshop 5.5.  No problems at all.  This is an excellent program and leap years ahead of my Photoshop 5.5.  This is a much less expensive way to upgrade to cs2..rather than purchasing CS2 outright.

Be sure to get the updates after you install the program.

Great improvement in Photoshop technology.  I've greatly improved my ability to process astrophotography.  It's now much easier to make the same changes to multiple images of the same celestial object.  Greatly reducing the time required to process multiple images for stacking, aligning and combining.

This is a very good racing simulator!  But it's no arcade game so if you want to jump into a car and race around with little or no practice this is not the game for you!

It will take you time to perfect the driving skills and learn the handling characteristics of the various cars.  You're going to need a good wheel and pedal combo to get the most of this game.

Graphics are very good, but the race car physics and handling are exceptional.

Highly recommended for racing sim fans, not recommended for the casual race game player

This is the most technically excellent racing sim I have played. The physics are perfect, the graphics are pleasing, and there is a wide variety of tracks and cars. The learning curve can be very steep, but you can adjust the AI to suit your needs. You can also turn on traction control, steering aids, etc., which will get you into the game faster. After a couple months, you'll be good enough to turn these aids off and drive the cars the way they are meant to be driven. There is also a comprehensive driving school which will train you in the basics of racing. If you want a realistic racer, buy this game

Bought this after thoroughly enjoying GT Legends.  If you want to experience the best driving SIM on the market, buy GTR2.  While I love rally, sprints, NASCAR and most other driving games, this one sits on the pole.  Complexity level and your own personal motivation to get better keeps it from getting mundane. Graphics rock.  Get your system up to speed as all these other review suggest and that means a good wheel/pedal combo as well. How good is it?  I've had it several months and I still say it is the best there is.  Semper Fi

This 'game' is awesome, if you like SIMs...  

Do not buy this if your goal is to enjoy a leisurely drive once in 
a while.  'Playing' it is hard work and requires your full concentration.
Great tutorials to teach you how to drive on a track (it is *very*
different from taking the family car for a spin).

I got it with my Logitech G25 (an AWESOME FFB wheel).  I think these
two were made for each other.

I currently have version 1.0 on my pc. It does everything it claims to and does it flawlessly. It cleans internet cache, history, cookies and more! I've tried another internet privacy program, but it failed to clean up the tracks that this program successfully cleaned. I especially like the fact that it cleans the autocomplete entries in my internet search and internet browser. Others can use my pc, and won't be able to see what documents I've recently opened, which programs I've recently run, or what I've searched for and what sites I've visited online. And that's the way it should be! This program can be set to clean up this information securely (can be set to wipe not just delete the info). Another plus, it can clean usage tracks for all users on a pc. The program I tried on my other pc only worked with administrator accounts (and not very well may I ad)

I've been using this product for awhile, and I'm delighted with it. I got my Algebra I Homework done in 1/5 the time it usually takes me! In addition to this, when I feel like learning, I watch some of the Discovery Channel videos that are included with this. Even better is that this product comes with a $[...], reducing its overall price to $[...]. Today I'm going to use it to help me write a five paragraph essay.

I love Microsoft Student with Encarta Premium 2007, and you will too! Buy it! Trust me, you WON'T be disappointed

I purchased this program simply for the Encarta 2007. I was amazed at all of the wonderful features that Microsoft put into the package. I feel that anyone in school or not would find this program to be a useful tool in your daily life. Enjoy it.

I wish the reviewer had stated whether MS Office 2003 Small Business Edition satisfies the requirement. Pending clarification, I'll stick with Encarta 2006 despite its less (than 2005 version) user friendly search page.
Encarta is an amazing product for kids of all ages and I'm more than willing to predict that 2007 is worthy of 5 stars

This product is a masterpiece.  It's a testimony to early 21st century thinking about the world, the earth, learning, and software.  It's a Swiss-Army knife of information with a kind of practical beauty that we associate with tools that work. Check out the map tool, and the view of the Earth at night.  It's delight and a gift to an active mind.

Somebody has thought long and hard about what students need on their computer to succeed.  What they've come up with is an awesome collection of innovative productivity tools for kids.

Take math. The math tool alone is worth the price of admission. This is where algebra class should start.  Math lovers will eat it up. For the less than loving, Student includes really excellent tutorials on math concepts.  It even links homework help for many of the major math books.  You put in the textbook, the assignment, and it steps the student through the problems.

Homeschooling? Read no further.  Just buy it.  

Geography? The map tool, especially the statistical mapper lets you view the world from outer space, with or without political boundaries, and compares the performance of countries on a zillion measures.  Literature?  It's got summaries and readers guides for a huge list of required reading, and not just the stuffy Victorian novels, but Ursula LeGuin and even some titles that I didn't think were worth reading.  The language tools -- you can hear a word pronounced in a surprising array of foreign languages,plus dictionaries and translators, and even plugins for MS Word that make it easy to write in French or Spanish.  No more funny key combos to get a cedilla.

Plus Encarta encyclopedia -- which is safer and way more effective at leading kids to track down related ideas than a web search. 

I'm sure I'm leaving something out.

The only problem is, it takes gigabytes of memory and really ought to be partnered with MS Office.  That said, if you take education seriously, you ought to have this on your computer

I initially purchased Creator 9 to do the same thing this software does, but the only thing is it didnt hang my computer when it came down to burn the DVD.  This software is pretty much easy to use, comes with two (Bibles) manuals, plenty of information in there to creat some good videos.  I recommend buying this or you can always buy Creator 9 have it crash your system and then spend a few days trying to review other products out there that have gotten good reviews such as this one. You will be happy with the videos you make. You can make a video containing still images (pictures), video from camcorder camera or from your computer, add text in the movies, add background music, its awesome.  I must say again it wont hang your system. Please get it, your family and yourself wont be disappointed.

Our photo and video editing softwares were both very basic and "old", so we decided to upgrade a couple of months ago.  After reading many reviews on different bundles, we decided to get the Adobe Photoshop Elements 5.0 Premiere Elements 3.0 bundle.  We've played around with the Premiere Elements a bit, and it's really awesome.  Much better than the Pinnacle Studio 8 we had before.  All the basic functions are easy to use and very intuitive, though we haven't gone and figured out the more advanced features yet.  The Photoshop Elements is a wonderful tool, as well.  We recently had to scan in a lot of old pictures (as in 20+ year old b/w photographs).  They needed a lot of touching up, and Elements 5.0 worked wonderfully for that.  I could adjust the lighting and sharpening, fix the colors and scratches, and the pictures turned out amazing.  You'd never be able to tell they were scanned images from such old photographs.  The program is also very intuitive.  I could do all the things I wanted to do without having to read the manual.  Of course, I'm still just touching on the surface of what all is possible, and I plan on reading the manual and studying the program in more detail once I have the time to do so, but for what I need right now, it's easy to use and does a good job.  There are only two things I have to comment on that I don't like about the Adobe bundle, and they are the reason why I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5.
1. The stated minimum requirements for this bundle are 512MB RAM.  That's what we had on our computer, and while the program worked, it was so painfully slow that it wasn't feasible to really use it.  We ended up upgrading to 1GB, and it's been working great since.  So if you have less than 1GB RAM, make sure you upgrade before getting this software!
2. The red-eye fix in Photoshop Elements, or lack thereof.  There is an auto red-eye fix, but it doesn't work very well.  It finds red eyes in all kinds of places, just not where they actually are.  Sometimes it covers half the face, sometimes only half of the eye, etc. etc. etc.  There is an option to manually show the program where the red eye is, but it still doesn't work right.  Maybe there's another trick I haven't found out about yet, but as of right now, I usually give the fix tool a shot, and if it doesn't work I take the picture back into my old editing software and fix the red eye there.  I'm really very disappointed with this, as fixing red eyes is something you have to do quite frequently when editing pictures.  
Overall, the software has been very easy and fun to work with, even for an amateur like me.  :o)  If Adobe can adjust the minimum requirements recommendation and fix the red-eye fix tool, it's going to definitely deserve 5 points

TaxCut has been very reliable information and easy to use when preparing your taxes.  I have used it over the past several years.  Updates are easy to download and the software is great.  This year the software arrived on a USB key.  This is the easiest and best way to obtain the software.  Small, easy to store and is reusable.  I will continue to use TaxCut in the future

H&R Block 2006 works well like it always has. I've used and liked H&R since the Turbotax activation debacle, to the extent that I can like doing income tax! What is great is the media the software comes on. Install the program and then have a nice flash drive to use elsewhere. Maybe flash drives will be like floppies someday, with piles of used drives in a box, but for now it's a super handy way to store and move a few files. 256 megs makes for a big floppy but a small flash drive. No matter--the price it right

I bought this for my four girls.  they all love it, ad are learning lots.  but the quality of the graphics, characters, and even theme (or story) seem to be low budget.  We have a lot of other educational computer games which are just fun for even me to watch (and play).  The overall quality in our other games is much higher.  It is a lot like comparing Disney cartoons to Speed Racer.
BUT...my oldest, who is 11, still enjoys this program and has not complained about anything I write about here

I got this software from Office max. which is on sale for $8 on last week.
My 6 year old kid, start learning typing and he keep saying he want to type all the time.

Pros:
Settings are awesome. 
You can choose two types of keyboards
You can choose your words per min speed and many other aspects
You can choose 4 different musics or do not have any.
You can choose the difficulty levels.
Games and encouraging things for kids.

Cons:
Still needs to find one.

How does it matter about cartoon chars speaking to you, 
Adult can also learn from this CD, just by skipping cartoon talk.

I bought this title because the first Typing Instructor For Kids got such good reviews.  I was looking for a way to teach my 8yo son keyboarding.  He has always had a terrible time with handwriting.  I knew I needed really easy, slow-paced typing instruction for him, or he wouldn't get it.

Well, it's 6 months later and he can now type!  We did it with nothing but this software.  I made him practice about 10 min/day 5 - 7 days/week.  All in all, he found it to be work to learn this new skill, but still rather enjoyable.

There are 11 games included and several of them are very good -- meaning they are really fun AND build typing skills at the same time.  There is also a series of drills, lessons, and typing tests to teach the keyboard.  The keyboard is introducted a few keys at a time, and then you repeat the related drills, lessons, tests, and games until those keys are learned fairly well.  I had to require my son to keep repeating each section of the keyboard until he could do it at 15 wpm before letting him go to the next section.  This is what the software recommends, but I had to learn it the hard way.  At first, I let my son go ahead too fast and he ended up getting overwhelmed.  I ended up having to put a sticker chart on the wall and offering him prizes for getting to 15 wpm on each section.

I would recommend this software for children from 6 to about 11.  The cartoon characters are very juvenile and would probably offend a child any older than that.  However, for any adolescent or adult able to ignore the juvenile cartoons, this would be an excellent way to learn to type too.  I found that my typing skills improved just by occasionally using this software.

I just bought this thru Best Buy - could have got a better deal thru Amazon - oh well.  This product is amazing and very user friendly.  I really love the fact that it comes with its very own manual not a help guide you can print out yourself wasting all your paper.  It does everything - the props are very realistic, the shapes & edges so cool.  I have filled in very dark pictures using the watercolor feauture and made poor pictures look like works of art.  Not to mention that I can create my own photomontages, collages, & very unique artistic scrapbook pages.  It took me an hour to scrapbook an amazing page including fixing up photos. I will never spend money on scrapbook pages again!   So much fun!!

I recently wrote a review for this item due to a launching issue. Very angry, I made numerous calls and emails to Nova. At last I was able to converse with a rep who was more than helpful and made right with all my issues. I am pleased with my outcome with Nova and the response, making sure I was a satisfied customer.  I only rate this 4 stars as I am just now using the program and am very excited with what I've been able to accomplish in the past 3 days.  Thank you Nova for your help

I really enjoy using this program, much better than what was out there 5 - 10 years ago when I last worked on genealogy.  I love the Ancestry.com feature, it is wonderful to go find your grandparents, great-grandparents and even great-great grandparents in the US Census.  I have found out a few things that I didn't know, unfortunately my Mother recently passed away, and I have no one to verify some of it with.  I would suggest that anyone contemplating this program gets it now, and starts working while you still have elders who can help you sort through the information you find.  I also found a family tree out there from someone who only lives a few blocks from where we used to live.  She has traced her family back to the 1500's in Germany...and it appears that they are related to us.  It was strange to go to her website and find a picture of my Great Grandparents headstone.  It was just another branch of the family.  Buy it

This is a really great bargain.  The spreadsheets are easy to use with built-in formulas just like excel, instead of paying hundreds of dollars.  This was better than I expected for the money.  Excellent product, would highly recommend it for any home business, small business or everyday budgets, events and home bookkeeping.  This is a 5 Star program

This recommended software is easy to load, except for online requirements to update the files due to changes in the documents from the time of publication/software release.  The files for download was large and took a long time on a dialup internet connection.  

The software was easy to use, without documentation, though documentation would have been much desired.  The time to fill in the data was not too long.  It took about 4-6 hours given that I had been filing all the tax info in a folder with all the references required.  The help in the software was great and insightful.  I preferred using a CPA in the past, but since my taxes has gotten significantly easier, this has been a definite cost savings.

E-filing was easy, but make sure not to lose the cd-sleeve after downloading the software. Otherwise, it costs extra to e-file.  Overall, it appears to be a great software package with great info and help.  I plan to use it next year, Lord willing!

If you don't have an overly complicated tax return I found that TaxCut is great to use.  The thing I like most is the interview.  Even if you don't think you qualify for what it is asking, say "yes".  It will ask more questions.  If indeed you don't qualify you have lost nothing and can proceed with the interview.  In tax year 2005 it uncovered something I had missed and I filed ammended returns for 2004 & 2005 and pocketed $300.  I also was excited about e-filing and direct deposit.  I filed in early February and had both my Federal and State refunds in my account in three weeks.  It comes with Deduction Pro which makes keeping track of things very simple and it all imports for next year.

Amazon had the best price at $49 and free shipping for the February timeframe

Everything I need to file my Fed and State taxes. I did not expect the Deduction pro to be included; pleasely surprised. I have used Taxcut for a few years now. I like the import of previous year tax data (less typing).

It seems H&R has an online version. It would be nice if their online version can import data from my purchased version. Oh well, maybe next year

I am a computer repair tech and I can bet 90% of the problems reported in these reviews for this product is because people double install security programs. You should never install more than 1 antivirus program into your OS. Most of the decriptions of problems are from doing just that, double installs. PLEASE PLEASE ..remove/uninstall any previous antivirus programs and 3rd party firewalls. then reboot..use a good registry cleaner-freeware program like CCleaner to remove leftover registry keys, then reboot again and then and only then install your new Antivirus/Security program. I have this program and when installed properly on a cleaned system, it works great. A very good product at a very good price. I can't comment on it's tech support, I have never used it

Having a study bible on my palm pilot has been very helpful. Whenever I had some down time I always wished I had my bible. Now I do at all times. It is easy to navigate. Takes up a good amount of memory so just be prepared, but if you have enough memory on a card in your palm, it works great. I have used the memorize help feature a lot as well for memorizing verses. Great product!

I purchased this Bible study set to use with my Palm LifeDrive.  It works perfectly on this device.  Truly, it is exactly what I wanted.  

It should be noted that the NIV Bible - and the other translations in the set - obscure God's name (YHWH).  This makes it easy for mainstream nominal Christians to attribute Jesus as being the almighty God - instead of being simply the only begotten son of the almighty God.

But the translations are otherwise rather good - and the tools offered in this software set make it well worth the money.  After all, God is a judge of hearts and intentions rather than the technical errors of man trying to understand Him.  Jesus preached love of even our enemies rather than legalistic jargon.

It would have been great if the set included an interlinear (word for word translation) of both Old and New Testaments.  That would have been a very great addition; but it would have doubled the cost.  If such becomes available I will gladly pay the price

I bought this NIV study bible and really enjoy the options it provides:  Daily memorization.  Morning and Evening Meditation and Many different ways to "Read the whole bible in a year... read "OT NT PS and Pr. in a year".  N.T. in six months".  "Daily light on a daily path".  Etc.  There are many ways to approach your daily study.   Easy to navigate and can even highlight in colors.   I would recommend this for anyone who wants to take the bible with them on the road or to work or wherever you take your Palm Pilot.

This is a great PDA Bible for many reasons, several of which are already mentioned in other reviews.  It is easy to use, has most of the NIV Study Bible notes and crossreferences, comes with a multi color highlighter (great for using different colors for different purposes...red for commands, blue for promises, etc.), you can change the font for easier reading, and it has a great search engine in case you want all of the references to, say "peace" that occured in the New Testament.  The programs that come with it are nice as well, including one that tells you what to read if you want to read the Bible in one year, the OT in one year, the NT in one year, and many more options.

I was somewhat disappointed by a few features that would have made it a hands-down 5 star program, though.  The original NIV Study Bible has elaborate introductions for each book, including author, purpose, structure, and much more.  The Palm version is lacking all of this, and has no introduction at all.  

The original also has many cultural information boxes all throughout the Bible, like a description of the differences between Pharasees and Sauducees; the palm version does not.  

The cross references are wonderful - click on a small circle after a verse, and all of the cross references pop up.  Simply click on a cross reference, and the program takes you right there.  Unfortunately, however, the Palm program has no feature like a "back" button that gets you back to the original text.  Finding your original spot is not difficult - it only takes 5 seconds and a little concentration - but would have been much nicer to go instantly back the same way you can instantly get to a cross refernce by clicking on it.  

Finally, I would be actively marketing this product and the Palm platform to all of my friends if it included all of the wonderful maps that the original has - maps of the Holyland, Jerusalem, the Middle East, the Temple, and others that are in my paper NIV Study Bible.  

Despite these flaws, however, the program is a joy to use and I highly recommend it to all.  I am using a Tungsten T3 - the larger screen size make reading easier

I've been using TurboTax since 1999. We run two small companies and my background is in accounting. Hence, I have a VERY hard time giving someone else my bookkeeping and taxes to do, since I really have a hard time letting go of the control! (I've really got to get over that!!) Each year, it seems that TurboTax does nothing but improve! I typically delay until the last minute and cram it all in on April 14, and if it wasn't for the simplicity fo this software, I'd be filing extentions every year. Really, gathering all your stuff together is the hardest part. This software does everything else for you.

Turbotax was a great service, but I would like to be able to navigate with menus/tabs to a greater degree of specificity within the input pages itself. Writing the return often requires back-tracking to a page that you alread covered.
To get to a particular prior page, I would often be forced to go through up to 5 or 6 prior pages, reading the question each time because turbotax highlighted the default which was not my previous choice. This was a colossal waste of time in an otherwise excellent product. It could easily be fixed in the 2006 software if turbotax 1) switched the defaults to the users' previously-inputted values (CompleteTax does this and it seems like an obvious thing to do) and/or made it easy to navigate to a prior page by giving a link to every input page when a user clicks a superior tab or link. This is what a good web-page does, and it would be very helpful if turbotax did the same.

I was a Norton user for a long time.  I think this is a better program -- lighter, leaner, easier to use.  It automatically updates frequently.  I've never had a virus.  I use wireless and I can always tell if someone is trying to use my system (which is never, but I've tried to break in myself just to check.)  Nice program

I have always used Norton Products for antivirus.  For the previous 12 months I had problems getting the auto update feature to work and as a result had to download new definitions every time I turned on my computer.  (a royal pain!)  At renewal time, I looked around and found PC-cillin software was highly recommended.  I bought it and loaded it easily.  Since I'm not very computer savy, it took me a little extra time to figure out some of the settings.  It works well.  I miss a couple of Norton features like adding an email sender to the blocked list with one click - but updates load by themselves and I've had no problems.

I've been using Norton Antivirus 2002 with annual updates of patches forever with Norton Internet Security 2003. Now that it's time to renewal Norton Antivirus, I thought I switch to Trend Micro Internet Secuirty 2005 after all the glowing wins it received from certain mainstream computer magazines. I like Norton 2002 but it was a memory resident hog in the TaskManager considering I was running a P3 500 laptop with 196MB on WinXP Pro, resources are valuable. Also newer Norton Antivirus version were a hit and miss.  After also reading reviews at Amazon, I took the plunge with Trend Micro. My review of this product can be best summarize along with it's relations to Norton Antivirus 2002 (updated).

Pros of Trend Micro 2005:
1. Fastest virus scan I've seen. I have not find any virus in my system yet whereas Norton would fail in about .01% of the time( i.e. one stalling virus every year).
2. Check incoming and outgoing mail like Norton
3. Scan selected files as I chose just like Norton
4. Alert and Block virus threats
5. Monitor nearby Wifi connection
6. $25 mail in rebate making the price net at $15. (It's been 2 months since I've mailed it and not received it yet).
7. Uses about 10MB of system background resources versus Norton's 30MB.

Cons against Trend Micro 2005:
1. Very annoying  auto-virus update every day that I log on the internet. I only have a 56k connection and updating takes 5 minutes. I'm not trying to save the internet but everyday update may be a bit too much so I would prefer to have a preference setting that I can choose myself. Norton is not as annoying.

2. On a wifi network, Trend Micro Firewall failed 5 of the Gibson research Shields Up test. Ports were open. Norton Internet Firewall close all major holes except for the non-critical ones which wasn't a big worry. I ended up disabling Trend Micro Firewall and using the Norton Firewall instead as it's a full software and much better analysis and deeper protection.

3. Anti-spam and data protection were subpar as I got advertisements and  pop-up from certain websites like West Cost major newspaper. Using Norton Firewall stops them dead; never seen them again.

4. Still waiting for rebate.

Overall, I think using TrendMicro Internet Security 2005 for it's fast virus check and a separate Norton Internet Firewall is the ideal combo for me. On it's own merit, Trend Micro would be perfect only if RAM and other resources are low as the case with my laptop but I wouldn't mind using Norton if I had plentiful more RAM.

I found the product to work very well for antivirus, spyware and spam.  It is nice to have one product at a reasonable price that has multiple functions rather than 3-4 sperate products and their associated cost and maintenance.  I had been using Norton 2004, but it only did a good job on viruses.  Although it would detect spyware after the fact, it did a poor job of removing them.  I had also used the MS beta, which although detected more spyware than Norton, would not block it.  I had one computer that always seemed to be crippled with spyware.  Since I installed PC-Cillin, I've had no problems.  I've also found the spam blocker to work fairly well, catching about 80% of the spam.  I had been using multiple rules and a spam list with outlook, that probably only blocked about 40% of the spam, so this is a big improvement. 
My only complaint is the rebate- I sent in the required info and it was rejected due to "invalid/missing UPS."  I then sent a copy of the UPS they indicated that was missing, but never got anything back.

I became a committed user of OneNote in its orginal version in 2003. The new 2007 version seems to improve somewhat on this product's functionality. I use OneNote as a depository for research information collection. I can create any number of notebooks and subdivide each into any number of sections and subsections, which allows me to put information where I want it. I recommend that people who collect information in one form or another give OneNote a try.

I've been using OneNote since it was first released.  The 2007 release is the most effective writing/note-taking/information-organizing tool I've ever seen.  Data can be exchanged with other MS Office programs easily.  It can be used with tablet p.c.s, desktops and laptops. 

Information can be organized by Notebook, Section and Page (great for students to keep their notes organized efficiently).  It is a great way to keep research notes, cut-and-paste exerpts, etc.  

This is, quite possibly, the most useful piece of software on the market

I've used version 2003 and enjoyed it thoroughly.  I primarily used it for school with different classes and notes for each.  What was great is that is consolidates everything in a way that makes it easy to retrieve your notes. It also makes it easy to generate reports based on the tagging feature.  The tags allow you to highlight and gather key points of information that make writing papers a breeze.  When working with paper, this was not always an easy task to take on.

Several weeks ago, I downloaded the trial version of OneNote 2007.  The improvements are rather subtle, but powerful.  It didn't take anything to get comfortable with the new features.  After a short time with the trial version I just purchased it because it was so much fun. 

Here are some of the beneficial features:

-Like a paper notebook you have sections, but with OneNote 2007 you can have as many sections as you like.

-You can easily link pages to Outlook. I have linked appointments to a series of notes and support files for various projects and meetings. It makes being organized for a meeting a breeze.

-Also, it's a great way to archive emails in a way that allows you to see them and organize them as you wish.  You can empty your in box and at the same time keep a record of important emails.  Well worth your time.

-It is also tablet friendly if you use a tablet PC like I do.  I love it for that use.  There is a fantastic text recognition feature that works EXTREMELY well. If you use a tablet, this is a great feature.

-As was with the earlier version, you can add voice content to your notes. That's right, voice recorded messages can be added to your notes.  Too cool.

Before you buy, you might want to go to the Microsoft site and download the trial version.  You'll be able to assess for yourself.  I think you'll be pleased.  I fond it to be one of the best products for 'electronic file keeping' that I've used.  For the price, it's not a bad deal.

I have used OneNote 2003 for a couple of years now, and it is a fantastic program.  OneNote 2007 is a very nice upgrade.  It is extremely versatile and works with a variety of organizational styles.  I have gone nearly paperless for my projects.  I can pull in emails, web pages, graphics, scanned documents, MS Office (and other) documents, screen clippings (a OneNote feature), Excel tables, links to files and web sites, etc. OneNote 2007 adds a a better, more intuitive interface, and integrates better with Outlook (e.g., the tasks work together better) and other Office programs.  (Note:  I sue Outlook 2003 at work and Outlook 2007 at home, and OneNote seems to work fine with both).  It also integrates better with Windows Mobile Smartphones and PDAs.  OneNote2007 has a Mobile OneNote component that allows you to take notes on your PDA/Smratphone, and sync them with "Unfiled Notes" tab in OneNote.

A great program that is sure to catch major traction in the coming years

I enjoy using Encarta 2007 and can relie upon their information. I use it in conjunction with Britannica 2007 to get the most well rounded information. I do prefer the interface and ease to Britannica 2007 but the quality of information on Britannica is always to be trusted. 

My advice you need to buy both

Kudos Microsoft. My last go around with Encare was with the 2004 version. At that time the program had a cluttered clusmey interface. The various modules weren't intuitive or intergrated and it was therefore, confusing and not partuiclarly user friendly. The new interface is quite simple but very powerful. It is well integrated with the web and therefore capable of constant updating. Perfect for the student and anyone who likes to research topics. If you have not tried Encarta in a while, check it out, there is much to like.

Encarta Users will have no problem using and enjoying the newest version of Encarta - 2007
It is just as informative as the last versions with a lot of extra kicks, like the newest Videos. Recommend at least 1 GB of RAM and a Pentium 4 Processor with a newer Video card (2 Yrs or better)for the best video viewing
It will run on older system

I purchased Panda Internet Security 2007 for two reasons: The price after rebates (Free) and the fact that it is a 3-user license.  After switching from McAfee to Norton (and a subsequent 1-year renewal) I decided to either buy PC-Cillin 2007 or try Panda. (39.99 or Free...hmm...)  I installed Panda on my laptop first (after uninstalling Norton Internet Security 2005).  No problem what-so-ever.  In the initial HDD scan, Panda found and cleaned 5 files that were found in my email inbox identified as a worm.  I then installed Panda on 2 desktop machines with no problems there either.  Panda found 3 traces of spyware on one machine and nothing on the second.  

Panda boots up with Windows XP quickly.  It has only given me a couple of pop-up messages (one for a WiFi intrusion, which was another computer on my network...I accepted it and it never came back.  The other pop-up was to start on-line customer service or something like that...I declined it and it has yet to come back.)

My laptop is a P4 1.8GHz, 1GB ram, 32MB ATI video, 40GB HDD.  The initial virus scan took less than 20 minutes, scanning over 250,000 files.  Not bad!  Desktop 1's first scan (P4 2.4GHz, 512MB, 128MB video, 120GB HDD) scanned nearly 300,000 files also under 20 minutes.  Desktop 2 was the quickest (P4 3.4GHz, 1GB, 128MB video, 80GB HDD) scanning over 330,000 files in about 15 minutes.

I am extremely impressed with Panda Internet Security 2007.  It's everything I hoped it would be.  I would definitely recommend this product to others

Purchased this a while ago and recieved it yesterday.

Reason? My computer was moving much slower than it used to. Mcafee scans my computer everyday, and doesn't find anything, yet it was fully updated. I had a feeling it wasn't working.

When I installed this thing, I scanned it right away. This is what it found:

Viruses: 67

Spyware: 312

Adware: 51

After the scan, everything was deleted and my computer ran like new again. I am very pleased with Panda's software and will purchase again if needed

The product came well-packaged and unopened. I really needed instructions on how to open the packaging. But once I got it opened and installed, the product works as well as promised. The set-up and ribbon menu is a lot more user-friendly than 2003. I downloaded the trial version that Microsoft had offered, and I must say that this is the best Office product offered by Microsoft to date

If you don't need outlook but do need powerpoint, this is a great value.  Before, you had to be a student or teacher to get a good price (full retail $150 now).  Office 2003 standard even on eBay is still going for $175 plus.  This does not offer anything much beyond Office 2003 but the new ribbon format is not difficult to learn.  Also, don't worry about file formats.  You can re-set the default format to prior formats so that anything you send out can be read by earlier versions of Microsoft Office.

This is great! The free trial version on download.com had saved my computer (the only program that got rid off some spyware that was in my start-up and causing lots of problems). And I've also used the trial version on several of my friends' computers. It hasn't picked up much, though, since I bought it. But that's probably because now I have a new hard drive and a firewall. Before, I  bought the computer used and didn't know what a firewall was. I should have saved the disk and installed it when I started having problems. But oh well, it's doing it's job and if I start having problems once the CD expires, then I will probably buy a new disk. That's how good it is

All in all a fine product.  Has gotten excellent reviews from PC MAG.

Norton slowed my machine to a crawl.  This has not.

Suggest NEVER paying full retail for it unless you absolutely have to.  I've been using it for a few years now and always manage to find a free after rebate deal on it a few months before the one year subscription period is up.

It does require the user to provide authorizations the first time it sees a programs attempting to access the web.  For a non techie, this may seem a bit intimidating because there will be a lot of queries from it in the first few days of usage

This is what you need if you want a suite of protection for you pc.
I've used mcafee. It drove me nuts. I've used norton. Also drove me nuts. ZoneAlarm worked nearly flawlessly (as well as windows can.) It is a very stable and intuitive program that is what I have been looking for. All I can is that you should buy this and get rid of whatever you're using now, especially if it's Mcafee or norton. Just a sidenote: I run AVG free antivirus alongside this and I also ran it alongside norton and mcafee. AVG would catch things that neither Norton nor mcafee would. Never have had that problem with ZoneAlarm

I have Windows XP which came with McAfee. I used both Norton and McAfee but lately McAfee's updates seem to have giving other users a lot of trouble.  Rather than updating the anti-virus definitions, etc., I decided to try Zone Alarm where many users seem to like it.  

I must say that from the moment I installed it the only problem I ran was that you have to completely unistall your current antivirus, firewall, etc. if ZoneAlarm is  to work.  To date the software has worked beautifully.   Actually, I believe that my computer runs smoother and slightly faster.  I definately would upgrade or buy this product again.  Check some of the sellers for the bargain prices.  I bought mine for 19.99, which is a big savings from the ZoneAlarm website.  It is worth every penny

I had to put this review in because of the unfair one previously given. 
  Before I purchased this software, I checked out 5-6 of the major fish screensavers out their and this one is by far the most realistic, (movement, background, lighting, and noise).  I have two computers, one 800 mHz the other 1.4 gHz processor and the program runs perfect on both.  The goldfish screensaver is just as impressive, if you're into that kind of fish.  Don't let other marine/freshwater screen savers fool you by advertising more fish and backgrounds, the quality in all aspects, especially 3d-graphics and color (which are a must if your looking for realism), are poor.  I personally thought I'd like the extra fish and backgrounds (turtles in particular) in a competitors screen saver, so I purchased it instead of this one.  After trying it, I was very disapointed and luckily I was able to receive a refund.  I purchased Marine Aquariun and have never regretted it since.  What's great is they have a demo on their website your can try out too

I got Tiger to improve the working of my Powerbook G4 1.5.  My Jaguar installation was getting pokey after two years and a clean install with Tiger cleared out the annoying slowdowns in my computer.  Before Tiger, my computer would hang when playing large DV files (such as the ones I made in iMovie) but now they run without a hitch even though the hardware is the same.  This Tiger upgrade doesn't include some of the apps (games, Quicken, etc.) that my wife has on her new MacBook, but it did include a 30-day trial verion of iWorks which has come in handy

Why not have the best possible operating system for the best possible computer.  While this OS is not the top of the line today, it was when I bought it.  If you buy the MAC, it pays to have the best operating system. Stay current.  The hardest jump was from OS 8 to OS 9.  I was unable to bring any of my peripherals with me.  Now it is seamless. Like they say, just "Plug n Play.

Why buy the upgrade when you can buy the full version?

Basically cause it was cheap. You will see, old version, new version, 10.4.6, 10,4,8 and so on. I just bought the old version and installed the latest update. Now I am up to date and for a lot less money which meant I could spend the extra cash on more software for my Mac.

As far as performance, No faster than Jaguar or Panther. The Benchmarks say faster but if you stare at the screen in any version, the 10 nano seconds you save are not noticable.

You will encounter drive issues at some point as this version appears to have issues more often. This seems to be due to the new journaling scheme but I cannot back this up.

If possible I recommend you erase the drive you are installing to. In the disk utility, select the erase tab, and then the security button, Select the zero out data option. Note: you cannot erase a drive but only a volume.

This will clear out any corrupt data and pinpoint any bad or damaged sectors.

The main reason I wanted this was for the widgets. They are a blessing. Calculator, thesarus, package tracking, and many more. Tiger only comes with about a dozen widgets but in the widget configuration button, you will see the more widgets option. You will be directed to hundreds of others widgets for immediate and FREE installation.

My favorite is the weather and radar widget as I work outdoors a lot. I am able to quickly see the latest radar and plan my week, all by press F12. No need to interupt what I am doing on the Mac as the widgets will pop up in my layout and my activities stay active. Click any area other than a widget and they hide away.

If you want to wait for a version of the OSX that allows you to write your own widgets without taking a programming course, wait for Leopard

Tiger is simply the most advanced personal Operational System on Earth!

I am an advanced used. I have used all sorts of operational systems in the last decades: IRIX (unix from Silicon Graphics), SUNos (unix from Sun), Linux, and also the bad written Windows. Everytime I used Windoze in the last 20 years, I had to deal with crashes, hanging, lost of data and hours of configurations, tuning, adjusts, cleaning, etc. Even today, everytime I shutdown Windoze, it hangs, due to some program crashing. It's a true joke!!!

On February 2005 I decided to buy a Mac and give it a try. I bought a Mac Mini and started using it.

What I have to say is that I am using it for more than an year without an issue, without a crash. System is solid as rock. Some bad written programs eventually crash, but never the system. And I am the kind of guy who works with several heavy programs with heavy documents opened at the same time. Mac never crashed. I am about to suggest Apple a way to make it crash, so we can rest a little bit, instead of working all the time.

So much trouble I had in the past with Windoze that even today, while I am using the Mac, I feel like it will crash at any time. Fortunately it never crashed.

Beyond those functions advertised by Apple, you will see that MacOS is a superb gold mine for those who want to explore under the hood. Filled with thousands of powerfull unix commands and programs, you will be able to perform miracles.

Microsoft is copying everything it can from Tiger and advertising it as revolutionary features of up comming Windows (hasta la) Vista. I cannot see a single revolutionary function on Vista, as everything already exists on Tiger. The most amazing is some sites on the web comparing Vista (a vaporware not yet launched) with Tiger (an actual product).

The only thing Gates forgot is that one month after Vista is released, Apple will launch Leopard that will take the crown from Tiger.

What I can say you is that for the first time on years I have joy of using a personal computer.

Before buying QuickBooks you should Google: QuickBooks 2007 Simple Start Free Starter Edition. This free version never times out. You can immediately download 400m or get the CD with no shipping charge. The big limit in the free upgradeable version is you only get 20 total customers and vendors, so it is ideal for students and those with limited needs

It doesn't have to be for small business only, but will be handy if we decide to set up a small business in the future.  The price was just right for our purpose.

I have used Quickbooks Basic for a number of years both in my church and for my business.  I have kept QB 2004 Basic since the upgrades were not immediately necessary for me.

I chose to upgrade this year to keep current on maintenance, etc. so again I chose the most basic product offered - "Simple Start".  I received it just fine and it installed perfectly.

However, it does not upgrade any previous QB files.  As I investigated, Intuit says that it won't upgrade files from previous QB versions on their web site (albeit in small print) and on the product box itself, but that was not ever mentioned in the Amazon listing.

So then I had to upgrade to the next higher version - an additional $80.  QB Pro also works very well; it's just a shame that Intuit insists on misleading customers by not providing full information through all marketing channels.  The Intuit phone rep also tried to overcharge me $20 for the upgrade but quickly accepted the correct amount when I pointed out their error a second time.

Great backup solution. I install a second hard drive into someones computer and then let the software run and then forget about it. Never fails. Have not done a restore yet, but I would imagine it would be easy since I have an image of the hard drive and then the data that is up to date. Also, bought the software from a vendor that Amazon recommends, I don't no why they do this, but the software listed on Amazon is $49.99 which is the right price. I bought two from a vendor for $15.00 each. WOW what a savings and a great markup for me

All I needed was to upgrade the hard drive on my Dell laptop, so I got Acronis True Image version 9 for half the price of the current version 10.

I put the new hard drive (right off the sealed box) into a USB caddy that I got on eBay for $6, plugged it into the USB port, and ran Acronis 9.  Selected the "Clone Drive" wizard, and less than an hour later it was done.

No need to cross my fingers... the new drive booted right up, and I'm using it now to write this review.  What could be easier

I started with Norton Ghost 2003 many years ago and had problems backing up clone images.  Acronis True Image Backup 9.0 has a simple user interface that works well.  I used it to re-image my son's computer without any problems.  It is a good product for the price.  I highly recommend making a backup image of your hard drive on a weekly basis

Heard other poster said v10 has been available, so searched and found it is true. V10 is available at the maker's web site at the same price as that of v9 sold here.  BTW, I planed but haven't buy the product yet. But I have to assign a star number in order to post this message

Easy to install and navigate.  Automatic incremental backups are completed randomly.  Sometimes they work, other times they abort.  Can't determine why

In general...this program worked very well.  I've had a hard time putting my new Dual Core Pentium D computer in the RAID 1 configuration, so I bought this instead.  The clone function works extremely well and is an adequate alternative to the RAID 1 configuration, but I was a bit confused about how to use the "incremental backup" function.  The initial backup went well, but when I went back for incremental backup additions, it would tell me it was "impossible"....so I just clone the C drive every few weeks now.  I have two Seagate 320 GB SATA hard drives, and it's great to know that I have an exact copy of the c drive if I fry it.  I live in Ethiopia, so the power fluctuations are frequent and disastorous.  I've already lost one hard drive to power flux abnormalities.  I'd buy this product again, and it's comforting to know that it's on my system and that I can back up my valuable data easily and quickly when I need to

Why haven't I heard about the Mia characters before? I bought this for my god daughters 6th birthday without knowing anything about the game. We opened it together and I was BLOWN AWAY with the 3D animation-the same quality as Pixar. Everyone at the party was glued to the computer screen in this adventure land game. Best of all, its educational but because it was so entertaininng, my god-daughter has not stopped playing it. Well worth your money! I'm going to buy the rest of the Mia series

Perfect solution for using those windows programs we are used to...but on the Mac.  Runs smoothly.  Entourage is a fine email program and Word, Excel and the others work great.  A little spendy, but worth it if you need it.  Entourage communicates well with Oulook and has a similiar feel

I recently purchased Microsoft office, and so far, I have had the chance to use Microsoft word.  I am familiar with the product as I have had the older version before, with my old computer.  
I was pleased to find that I had no trouble with using my old files with this new software.  I also was glad to find a variety of templates which were easy to use.  I was able to print out business cards for me and my husband in just one morning.  
I am also glad that it isn't very much different from the old version, so I was able to use the program easily, without much adjustment.

This product is simple to use and does a good job converting my home VHS tapes onto DVD.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish it supplied the connection cables with the product.  Other than that, I have no gripes.  Worth the money in order to preserve your precious home videos

Don't think about video capture cards, going into the operating system, or even opening the computer case - just turn on the power, plug Dazzle's USB plug into your usb port, and connect the colored cords on your vcr with the same colored plugs on Dazzle, install the software, and let this wonderful tool do all of the heavy lifting.

EXCELLENT quality, and they will lower the quality if you want a smaller file - like, say, if you want to back-up your vcr to a cd-r. The test for quality is time - tell it to record to 70 minutes, and your work is DONE.

I REALLY like the fact that the software is so stable, I recorded a SIX HOUR VCR tape using a 512 meg XP machine - not a moment's problem.

They also included software that makes editing these video files real easy, if you want. That is just icing on the cake.

Strong, solid, silent - the John Wayne of VCR to computer file translator tools.

As an aside, I have held onto some VCR tapes for years, one for more than a decade, hoping something like Dazzle would come along.

Prayers answered.

Just shut up and BUY it

I did not think that introduction to the game was going to end.  I thought that I may be able to skip it but no luck.  Once into the game I believe that my child was enjoying the game and seem to be learning some great skills.  Lastly, you have to hit the "F" keys and "Esc" to save and exit the game, not many program make you do that today.

Overall, I feel that this was a good purchase and I would have given 5 stars if functionally was better with program

the mia series are great for our family.  the kids always look forward to playing their mia games.  they have the math adventure and grandmas remedy.  the two disc thing is confusing...but really doesn't interrupt play.  the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because it can be a little glitchy sometimes...mia will get stuck somewhere and not respond.  we just go back to a game saved in a similar spot and restart.  so it's not too big a deal.

I've been a Corel user since ver 5 or so. It's always been a decent graphics application, but Ver 12 and now 3X are the best I've ever seen. This program is SO INTUITIVE compared to others in this category. It;s particularly easier than Quarkxpress. I know Quark's a page layout app, but you can do the exact same stuff 95% of the time in Corel. Much better PDF's and a HUGE price advantage make this their best version yet. Indesign is also very good but pure useability gives Corel an edge.

I think some of the reviewers here did not use the program more enough, am using it since version 2 till now as an illustrator this program can't be beated... gradient fill was so stupid to create in earlier versions of adobe illustrator u must create two objects then blend them together to form a gradient fill then you have to mask it within a path or the shape you are filling, one more thing the mask in corel "container" is a wonderful tool to have much better than the mask used in illustrator that sucks (u have to see me pulling out my hear if i made i mistake using it) do you want more i have a lot to mention.

Am using both program everyday know them very well and to be honest i do all the artwork in coreldraw then i export to illustrator for color separation and printing and that becuase the printers agancies in my country don't know how to use corel so i have to ride the wave and finalize thing in illustrator.

I do all detailed drawings precisely using the guidelines and grid (first in available in corel) creating layouts, realistic objects or models with shadings and shadowing as well with ease this software is so powerfull if you are a real artist you must get i

I like this screensaver,because you think the fish are really real and you can feed them and watch them and you tap on the glass your fish will sometimes react. I'm going to keep it forever and ever.The 2 expansion packs to complete my screensaver of fish is the Arowana pack and the funstuff pack. Thank you for reading this cool review and my name is Kris.I really like aquazone

Every once in a while a product comes along that does one thing, and does it really well. The only question is "do you need it" With modern LCD screens and sleep/energy save modes, screen savers are virtually unnecessary. That's really the point of Aquazone, it has no practical value, but it is very cool.

Before we got our little dog Tova, we had a fish tank for a number of years. I do miss some of the relaxing aspects of watching fish swim around and interact. Fish are generally low maintance and considered by many a key stress reducer. I think of this screen saver program as a virtual tamagotchi or a aquatic version of the Sims. You can do everything you would do with a normal fish tank: add and remove fish, feed them, tap on the glass (or the keyboard in this case). Even better, you can mix fresh water and salt water, no worries about two male Betas in the same tank Fortunately you don't have to clean the tank and you don't get algae. If you want fish not included in the tank, you can buy some more online
If you ( or someone you know) enjoys fish and want to buy something fun and rather frivolous, this is a great program. If you aren't into fish, probably not worth buying

Pros: Does exactly what is says, creates a virtual fish tank
Cons: Probably a productivity waster at the office, gotta love fish to enjoy the program

I have a PowerBook, an iMac, and an eMac at home that are used in different ways. The kids use the eMac for school work, and my wife & I use the other 2 Macs for home business.

Although most school work was required in MS-PowerPoint or MS-Word, exporting from iWork '06 Pages and Keynote was very simple to do with 90-95% accuracy. Our kids said they just do minor editing at school before submitting the work.

For home business, we use Pages to do our proposals, bills, and receipts. And use Keynote for presentations. One thing that I thought was amazing, is the fact that I can display the notes and the succeeding slide on my PowerBook, while projecting just the current slide for the customer to see. 

For the price of the Family Pack, we were licensed to use iWork '06 on 5 Macs on the same network. The cost fitted our budget perfectly. The only thing I wish was available in Keynote was timed transition (example: after 3 seconds show bullet#1, after 5 seconds show bullet#2, after 2 seconds show the chart

Well its definetly improved version since the last one, but they still have a lot of things to do.  The biggest problem is Pages.  If text has specific symbols, like Greek letters and u try to export your file to doc, forget it.  u'll have the same problem as 10 yrs ago, either funky symbols or underline dashes.  Keynote is much better.  But if u r a scientist and not a sales man, both packages still have a lot of room for improvement.  However, I'm still happy with this purchase, because it's Apple soft and looks much nicer than any MS software will get in the future

Abobe hits one out of the park. I find Adobe software clunky and hard to use. While I understand that the more flexibility you want the more complex the program but Photoshop and InDesign have learning curves that are steeper than Mount Everest. I expected Lightroom to be the same - an excellent program with a huge learning curve. Well it is and it isn't which it why Lightroom is such a pleasure to use. I don't know what Adobe is thinking in creating this gem of a program but the team who designed it are collective geniuses. For they have taken a complex and sometimes frustrating chore and for lack of better words made it gentle and pleasing. The program makes spending time with your photographs actually enjoyable.

Lightroom is fabulous from look and feel to functionality. The strength is not only in the photo management portion of the program but also in the strong photo developing functions that can turn an OK photo into an amazing one.

If you do anything with photographs buy this program. You won't regret it

I've only been using Lightroom for a day, but I was pleasantly surprised with the Photoshop integration. Just hit Cmd-E, and Lightroom creates a copy of the photo (with our without the changes you applied in Lightroom) for editing in Photoshop format, and groups that copy in a stack with the original. As you save your changes in Photoshop, the image is updated in Lightroom. 

I felt that the workflow was very smooth.

This is a great software for Photographers looking for a faster way to manager and edit images. I gave it a four because I would hope that ADOBE would still find ways to improve this product. The functionality is superb, and for such a great program, it doesn't eat too much memory on your computer (I have a 4 year old PC with 768 MB of RAM). And because of this I'm shooting more pictures in RAW format and not worry about the time I spend in front of the computer.

I'll definitely be buying the next upgrade

Within a couple days after installing Dragon, it showed a high degree of accuracy. The accuracy depends on how late at night you dictate.  It was installed on a 2.7 Celeron with 512 of memory.  The program generally keeps up quite well. The program works with Comcast and AOL free ride but seem to have a lot of glitches with aol.com

This is probably one of the most outstanding and rewarding software programs that I can ever remember purchasing. I never learned how to type, so I reserved myself from many computer projects/reports, email responses and business related aspects due to this 'achilles heel'.

Well, I researched this software and found that it has come a long way from earlier versions and decided it's time to give it a try. I even bought a Plantronics CS55 - USB wireless headset from the get go to give this software a real workout. Let me tell you, my pessimism was definitely challenged because the software worked extremely good about 20 minutes after opening the box and browsing the tutorial. I was talking sentences and watched it appear on my monitor within seconds. I speeded up my speach as if talking in a normal conversation with someone and this software just kept spitting it on-screen. AMAZING!!!! Don't get me wrong. There are occasional misspellings to deal with but your user profile keeps getting updated everytime you use it and prevents the same mistakes from occuring the next time. It begins to gain more and more accuracy.

Salvation has been found as far as I'm concerned.

P.S. I began running the program with WIN XP - 512MB Ram and it performed very well. I just upped to 2 gigs ram. Most everyone in forums recommends at least 1 gig Ram.

I did this review in about 1 min. and had only two misspells.

I really enjoy this product, and am sure that voice-recognition will be standard techology for all computers one day.  It is very easy to load, set up and use....  everything that I needed was in the box. I speak with a slight accent, and it still works so smoothly. This is an invaluable tool for people at risk from carpal tunnel syndrome, for those who have difficulty using a keyboard efficiently, or for avoiding the fatigue of preparing large reports. It is so simple that you can speak out ideas and visualize them in print before deciding what to do next.  Great for doing e-mail...  all this and you can continue using the keyboard as you wish. I love it!

i really like my new windows vista upgrade.the graphics are stunning and it is extremely user friendly.infact, i liked vista business so much, i upgraded to the ultimate version.both versions are very easy to install;many people seem to be waiting for 'all the bugs to be worked out' but, honestly, the bugs aren't a problem.it is important to run the advisor about -is your system ready for vista before you install- to get rid of any conflicts your computer might have with vista;other than that everything else is a breeze. Use my system about 6 hours a day and am using a xps 700 dell computer go for it, you'll have lots of fun!

Product has a nice clean interface. I was able to load most drivers and application software without incident. Note - Upgrade install requirements are not clear. Microsoft should state what is expected on your system prior to trying to install either as an upgrade or clean install. Microsoft sites keep pointing back to sites that don't help very much.

I just upgraded SD v4 to SD5 and could not be happier. Release 5 has had a very rocky start to say the least. I do believe they released it a bit early. Fortunately I read the SD forums daily and only downloaded version 5 when it seemed the big bugs had been dealt with.
I have always found this product to be the best in it's class. Best detection and moreover removal. Easy to use. I've also had the product that is typically rated number 1 and for me it is no contest which I will stick with. This is my main, real time anti spyware product. 
I think one big plus is their customer service availability. This is important.  They are very responsive. Their forums on their website are also extremely helpful. Customer service is also free.  This application is fast and is not a resource hog. I have a lot of confidence in it. Also recently just downloaded their PC Tools Plus firewall...it's another great product and it is free!
Basically a good company to deal with.  I believe when the dust settles from this new (albeit too early) release of version 5, you will see Spyware Doctor attain 1st place on many tech lists

I am very pleased with the new 2007 Hallmark Card Studio Deluxe.  I have owned previous versions of this product and for my needs, I am well satisfied.  I especially like the ability to use suggested greetings and clip art to enhance my rubber stamped cards and scrapbooking projects.  I have used this software to print banners and business flyers as well.  It would be nice if multiple images could be contained in a text box.  Maybe in the future there will be more enhancements to this product for easiser use.  I am pleased with the card selection, verses and graphics.  For non professionals, I believe you get more than a fair value for the price

We purchased this program on the recommendation of a friend because we have a 4-yr-old grandson who's very interested in art and is comfortable with computers.  Turns out his older sister has the program in school, kindergarten.  They both enjoy having this to play with when they visit

Great product.  My child has autism spectrum disorder and this is a program that holds her interest.  She really likes the different music she can select and says some of it helps to calm her down.  I love it

I bought this program for my daughter for her birthday.  She wanted it because she's used it at school (1st grade).  

I was impressed by how easy it was to install - I installed it as admin, and she had no issues running it under her limited account (XP PRO).

I've been impressed with what she is able to do with the program.  She even made Valentine's day cards for her whole class with it.

Just be prepared to go through a lot of color ink

Essential for Microsoft Office 2007 users running Windows Vista. Office 2007 already provides a PDF converter; however, it does not allow for security, editing, or markup. PDF Converter does--and without the Tech Support hassles at Adobe. Since my new HP computer came with Adobe Reader already installed in the Vista environment, I kept it as the default pdf reader, and I use PDF Converter Professional for actual, stand alone conversion or editing of pdf documents. PDF Converter had a very easy Custom Install feature. I disabled all Microft Office, Internet Explorer, and Outlook add-ins, and I installed the product. It all works together extremely well.

Excellent product works as advertised and so simple to use. Product well packaged, arrived earlier than expected and in mint condition. ScanSoft responded with an eMail in a timely fashion acknowledging receipt of my Rebate paperwork and provided a pin number for me to access their site to check on it's progress. But you know Rebates....they take forever!
PDF Converter 4 is not my only ScanSoft Product. I also use Paperport 10 and am extremely satisfied with that.
My buying experience has always been positive with Amazon.com vendors, never a problem.

I have not used this product for very long, and was somewhat reluctant to purchase another brand besides Adobe who seem to dominate in this softward category, but I have, so far, been plaesantly surprised with the performance & features.  The ScanSoft PDF Converter Pro 4 software seems to do all Adobe can do (and a little more), at a fraction of the exhorbitant cost of Adobe Pro 8!.  I'm happy with my purchase thus far!

After looking at the other reviews, I was a bit puzzled.  I haven't had any of the problems other folks mention. PDF Converter Professional 4 doesn't do everything that programs costing FIVE TIMES as much money.  But, WHO CARES?  Background colors in a business form?  WHY????  

Don't buy a Camry and say "gee... I liked my Lexus better."

Most of you are going to buy this program to do one - or both - of these two things: 
 
1)CONVERT PDF DOCUMENTS into completely editable Word docs, Excel Worksheets, or one of dozens of other formats...

2)COMBINE documents of various formats into a single pdf. Picture a CUSTOMER MANUAL that consists of Word, Excel, SolidWorks, Quicken, PowerPoint and Project documents.   You want to put them all together in ONE document complete with Table of Contents, Bookmarks and Thumbnails.  VOILA!  This is the proram for you! 

And for these purposes, PDF 4 Professional is SUPERB.  It is EASY to use. We have SEVERAL users, and not one has had to refer to a manual or on line support. 

To put PDF Converter to the test, we recently scanned, then saved-as-a-pdf a crooked, not highly legible fax.  We THEN converted it into a Word document, and roughly 90% of it came through perfectly.  AMAZING.

HIGHLY Recommended

I understand that software companies strive to give new versions of their products "new" or "better" appearances but in my opinion toos and defaults should be recognizable from version to version as much as possible.  I have used versions of Corel since CorelDraw!3 I just moved to X3 from 10 and find that the trace tool works better but the mechanism is somewhat cryptic.  I would have great sympathy for a buyer that is using it for the first time if they had never used an older version simply because I could only figure it out through past knowledge and trial and error.  The results were great but the methodology lacks some of the intuitiveness of the past versions.  The pallettes are far less comprehensive thn version 10's pallettes.  I truly wish I had version 8's pantone pallette back even though it is incomplete it was so much better layed out.  i will never understand why black has to be at one end of the pallette and white at the other, waste of time...   The tools are all there but they appear different.  I went to work in X3 fright away and found I could work effectively on day one but I did resort to version 10 (which I have kept on my system) a few times in the first week to perform operations that I coupdn't figure out in X3 which were simple in 10.  The Help files are circuitous, apparently never actually getting to the point.  The on line tutorials are great for the absolute novice but useless to anyone who actually has worked with vector art before.  The Export to AI is still a little inaccurate even after all these years.  (You cannot select a line terminus and expect it to be there in AI) The EPS export filter doesn't always want to be readable in Adobe either.  The price is excellent, the product spectacular in its own right and I am happy with my purchase. I expected a little more in this version than I got but no less than I had with additional compatibility.  I still need to have a copy of Illustrator on my machine to deal with people who have only that program

This is one of the best graphics suites that I have ever used.  It is very user friendly and all the my students that I have used it have really liked it.  The toolbars are easy to find and the entire program is filled with outstanding graphics tools.  This is a must have for anyone who is serious about graphics

CorelDraw was my first foray into vector graphics back when version 3 showed up on my desk at the small "Mom and Pop" screenprinting shop i worked at. Back then, Corel came with OODLES of free fonts, clipart, manuals ... not to mention FREE technical support via a toll-free number.

i stayed with Corel exclusively until version 10 ... enduring countless patches, bugs and the dreaded "odd-numbered" curse (if you tried version 5 or 7, you feel my pain). Adobe Photoshop was always my photo-editing program of choice ... CorelPhotoPAINT just never quite "did it" for me.

Industry demands eventually delegated that i delve into Adobe Illustrator. Being already familiar with Adobe Photoshop's features, tools and "look and feel", Illustrator didn't present a huge, overbearing learning curve. In Illustrator, i found the same robust features as CorelDraw ... which wasn't what impressed me about Illustrator. Adobe's intuitive programs, and their ability to interact with one another ... seamlessly ... THAT is what won me over to Illustrator. Illustrator's ability to edit/create PDF's in their native format? WOW! Exporting LAYERED vector files to Photoshop ... with layers INTACT??? WOW!!! (i could go on)

Now, that being said ... there are STILL things that i prefer in CorelDRAW  compared to Illustrator. The EXTRUDE function in corel is MUCH easier to utilize. The PowerClip function is more user friendly than Illustrator's "make clipping mask" function. The ability to customize/edit/add shortcut keys is an amazing feature. (again ... i could go on)

In regards to importing and exporting files from other applications, CorelDRAW wins, hands down. It boasts a ROBUST set of import and export filters, my favorite being the .eps import filter which lets you import an .eps while converting the fonts to curves DURING the import. This is a MUST HAVE if you work with an .eps file created on another computer whose fonts you lack. If i had a dollar for every .eps that pulls into Illustrator with fonts blown out ... i'd be independently wealthy. WHY Illustrator has never implemented this is beyond me.

So, to sum it up ... CorelDRAW is a great program ... but i can't imagine it being my ONLY vector drawing program. Just like in real life, you need a great team. This program, paired with Adobe Creative Suite, meets my needs perfectly

I am average when it comes to design, but the tutorial helped me in creating a logo and it's cheaper and better for me to create one myself than pay someone to do it.  I like the tracing feature which allows you to remove parts of a photo to place in a new background.  To get the most out of this software you really need to be familiar with a lot of the features already, and there's a lot I am missing.  I will just have to take more time to keep practicing and learning from trial and error

I have been a Corel user for years.  This latest version is a great improvement.  Esp for Raster to Vector tracing.  I have always preferred to use Corel over our Illustrator even though I have both installed on my system.  Corel just seems to be a much more user friendly program.  Very powerful for anyone from Novice to Pro user

I have used Corel Draw since it was Draw 5 or 6, I can't exactly recall for certain so I guess some would consider me a software guru. I have also used other top level design tools and can tell you the fact is the Corel Draw Suite X3 is a robust design suite that has a very palatable learning curve.

The scope of what you can do with the software is amazing so certainly there is a new set of words to add to one's vocabulary however with terms like Pick Tool, Rectangle Tool, Ellipse Tool, and the like, I believe that it is pretty logical to get an idea of what the tools do just by allowing the mouse pointer to rest over the tool for about three seconds so the application can display the tool name and even the shortcut key to select the tool. 

The icons also give a pretty clear visual representation of what the tool will do e.g. a capital A is the text tool and guess what you do with it ... it allows you to add paragraph text, and artistic text. After you learn a bit about the text tool you also see that it allows you to place text in your document on a path.

The text on a path is just that... text on any path in your document. This can be a freehand line, an ellipse, a circle, or any other shape you care to make. How many of you have ever wanted to put your text in an arch?  In Corel Draw you simply make an ellipse with the ellipse tool, choose the text tool from the tool box, move the mouse pointer over to the ellipse and the mouse cursor changes to the text on a path icon and you click the left mouse button.  Now you type whatever you want around the shape that you have created.  If the text is not the size, color, font, or position you want you can change it, color it, or move it simply by selecting the pick tool.

I have developed a program to teach technology skills to middle & high school students with various disabilities in 46 sites throughout Oklahoma and the Corel Draw Suite is the first software application the students use. Do the students know how to do everything with the software after the first week, or fourth, or tenth? No, but if it took a week to learn it would not be a design tool in would be something like Print Shop Pro where almost everything is done for you and you just type in the text. There is nothing wrong with PSP but if you want to truly be creative, if you want to have the ability to design anything that you can see in your minds eye, then the Corel Draw Suite is the tool you want.

My program has a website that shows some of the work the students in the program have created. Just do a search for Tech-Now Oklahoma High School High Tech and you should be able to find the site. The section on weekly curriculum is a pretty good place to start but I encourage you to look around. Almost everything you will see on the site was created by the students using the Corel Draw Suite.

Corel Draw is a program that can be used in a matter of minutes but is as deep as you can possibly want to go.

I love this product. I had so many pictures that need to be in a scrapbook. This was so fast and easy, also it only took a couple of weeks to complete. I didn't over spend on paper,tape,glue, and etc. With three kids I don't have the time to sit down and cut, measure and more. with all my pages completed. I added a FEW things to go along with the theme of my page. I even used left over Christmas wrap to fill the 12X12 for Christmas pictures/theme

You can make calendars, greeting cards, birthday cards etc., as well as flyers.  The price for this software is very cheap for the quality and the amount you get from it.  It is a must

Among the various offerings available, this is perhaps the most complete. Each offerings has some unique capabilities that others don't possess; but if you want only one product this one gives you the closest match to a professional product that can be used by print shops

It's exactly what I wanted to buy: Complete collection of Ultimate X-Men. I don't mind scrolling up and down on my laptop in order to see the whole picture. The ads were kind of annoying though. I just hope Marvel puts all the other X-Men series on cds like this

I had a hard time putting this one down. I quickly read through the entire collection and it was over too quickly. I would recommend this to any X-men fan especially fans of the old comic books and it certainly takes up a lot less room than if I had the hardcopy versions. 
My only complaint is that it ends at the beginning of a new story. Ah well..

This works fairly well for me.  It easily downloads the capital gains from Microsoft Money, the interviews are fairly straightforward.  However there are a few areas (like foreign tax credit) where it should be automated but isn't.  But on the whole it does a nice job, they just need to improve it a little every year then it could be a 5 star item.

Worked fine for standard items. Did not handle Partnership issues completely. Would be good to have a preview of the finished return before printed (maybe this is possible, but I did not find this function).
In general, an easy, straightforward program that gets the job done

Got this game for my 12 year old and he LOVES it!  You need to have a pretty new computer to use it and it took a few trys to get it downloaded.  Once it was installed it was a really wonderful game!  If you have a child that likes puzzles and figuring things out, they will love it too

First of all, I want to make the point that this is a strategy based tycoon game and a sim game.  It is really well done using superb graphics and animations.  You get to apply new discoveries in your factories so you can make a better product and out sell them to your competitors.  It all seems to be based on real history so you get information from real sources like the Wright brothers, Edison and even Einstein. And you also have to worry about the people that work in your factories, your scientists, and accountants and even worry about industrial espionage. If you like business, engines, buildings, science and physics, you'll be getting hours and hours of play out of this game.  You also get to play in a bunch of different cities in the world.  Each one has different challenges. It's fresh every time you play since you can do things differently and see how the results vary

Took a couple of attempts to load this program on my laptop but once installed, it's more than I expected.  This is my first experience with GPS and I'm impressed with how quickly and accurately the GPS system locates my position and tracks my movement.  Full featured mapping software and plenty of GPS options make this an excellent value for my needs

Would highly recommend. We attend dog show that are in the middle of no were... This product got us to EVERY SHOW  we have been to since we started using it in March 2007.We especially in enjoyed the feature of being able to find what kind of business were in the area were.We hate getting lost especially with a truck loaded down with dogs and conformation equiptment, this product has stopped that from happening.   It would be nice if the 2008 version: 1 - it spoke the name of the streets while it was giving you the next turn 2- it would get rid of that agreement screen everytime you use it, once should be enough and 3 - It would be nice if we could log on to the web and down load the latest addition of gas station, place to eat and etc...  while we were down loading the construction updates. This product is a good buy for the money..

Just completed a 1600 mile trip from Ohio to Virginia Beach and the Microsoft Streets and Trips with GPS worked better than expected. Only lost the GPS in extremely hilly areas. No loss in towns. This thing is very precise for the low price paid. If you pull into a place such as a Gas Station, you have the address immediately. It can route you back to your mapped routing if you make a wrong turn. Pressing the space bar will get you the next turn in case you missed hearing the last prompt. This is a powerful program and should be an asset to any traveler. A co-pilot is good to have but not totally necessary. As mentioned above, it will route you back to your road if needed. A great buy. Would be nice if the prompt would name the street or route

Purchased this to help navigate a trip from Northern Michigan to South-west Florida and back again. We took a fair amount of side trips and having this on our laptop made it easy to get to where we wanted to go.  There were a couple of times that we went "off route" but were back on route in very little time.  It helped us decide where to stop for fuel, eat and sleep.  Up-to-date information is available with an internet connection and the larger map-viewing area was greatly appreciated.  Well worth the price.  Highly recommended to others

I have been a long time user of Delorme Products but decided to get a combination of Microsoft products both for the US and Europe (Autotrip). 

The program loaded very smoothly, but do make sure you load the program before plugging in the GPS Locator.  There are multiple warnings about this as well as what to do if you don't follow directions.  I loaded all the data on my laptop so I would not have to carry the DVD.  

The setup was also quite simple.  There are warnings about usage in an automobile that pop up in use (as well as the cautions during setup).  One needs to keep this in mind and not be distracted when driving.  I set the mapping program and forget it.  But it works best with two people in the car with one to navigate.

The GPS locator has a great chipset.  Very, very sensitive and quickly finds the coordinates within seconds, even as I sit in my house.  It rarely loses a lock on the satellite.  

The route finding works well, so far.  You can save your track as well as the route, but unlike the Delorme products you can't playback your track (or if you can, I have not found it).  The screen is pleasing and you go fullscreen.  

I haven't tried voice recognition but the spoken commands are about average.  The ability ot overlay satellite photographs when planning routes with an internet connection is a plus.  Plus you can routinely update road construction sites.  So far, no opinion on how good that feature is.  

The Microsoft location finder internet leaves something to be desired though I've only tried it at home.  It routinely thinks I'm in China (which is interesting because so many ads are quite able to figure out where I am).  

The GPS also works with other programs by selecting a generic NEMA GPS.  There are other optional equipment to go with the GPS.  

If you've never used a GPS mapping program with a laptop, Microsoft S&T is a good choice.  Just don't be surprised if the GPS lcates you accurately and the Microsoft locator product puts you on the other side of the planet.

I do a lot of work out of town and in other states, so I am constantly in unfamiliar or different places. This GPS has saved me tons of time and within the next two months will probably have paid for its' self in saved mileage that I used to spend looking for places. I have recommended it to everyone that I have talked to. It's great, I will never have to Mapquest or ask for directions again. Another Great Microsoft Product

Connecting the cables was so easy I was sure I must have missed something.
Recording the music is equally easy.  Removing the snap crackle and pop was a snap.  My only confusion resulted in recording from 45rpms, I should have left them as stereo because it seems as though if you check off as mono, you can not remove the crackle and pop

This product does a superb job at converting audio cassette recordings to MP3 format on your computer or MP3 player.  You can adjust the audio level and pause the recording and advance the audio cassette if you need to do those things.  There are other automatic features to shut off, etc. It also can remove noise from the recording and clean up the transients

Xitel INport Deluxe does what it says it does.  You can plug in any RCA AUX connector into the unit and with the software provided you can record it in stereo to your computer.

It's a good solid product that does what it says it does but instead of focusing on the features like other reviewers I will point out its minor drawbacks. First, audacity, the a free software that is mentioned in the manual has a tendency to freeze up while recording with the unit.  However, I don't know if it will freeze up on your computer.  Second, if you are thinking about buying this product to turn LPs to CDs, into most LP players don't have RCA AUX plugs and you'll need to buy an addapter.  
(What they don't tell you in the manual is that if you do this you first need to adjust the volume on the stereo and recorder volume in parallel which is kinda tricky.) Finally, the manual could use more detail because some of the important features weren't mentioned.   

If you don't mind these drawbacks, you will be able to have many years of recording pleasure if you buy this product

I bought this to transfer LPs to CD. It is simple to connect to the computer, and the software is easy to use. Just be sure when you download  the MP3 encoding program,  to put it in the same directory as the LP ripper.
The LP recorder works  well and is very easy to use. The LP Ripper, makes it easy to trim the tracks, and then encode them as MP3 files. 
When saving them as MP3's I can get approximately 20 LP's on one CD.
I am very satisfied with the product

Product is excellent does what it says and then some.  Instruction for installation and operating are very easy to follow (a winner in my book).  I had issues unrelated to this product running into problems with the stereo I was using in the fact that it didn't have outputs for audio so I was forced to use the headphone jack which required further purchasing adapters for the RCA cable was a bit frustrating but had nothing to do with this product.  I converted 2 albums last night into wav files cleaned them up with the audio cleaner included in the software.  Used the editing ripper included to split the 1 recording into separate tracks, actually the software does that for you but you have the option to preview there start and ending points for each of the tracks in case it may be off. I only had minor adjustments the ripper was pretty much on the money, overall.  I then downloaded the encoder recommended to work with this software and converted the wav files into mp3's with no problem. This is an excellent buy for those out there looking to do there own audio transfer of lp's and cassettes.  The sound is excellent on playback.

This product is very easy to install and use. In couple of minutes, I was able to set it up. I used the phone jack to input the music from cassette player to the computer and it worked well. 
The reason I give it four star out of five is that it records the music in wave format and there is no software in the package that converts wave file to DVD/CD/MP3 format

INport, excellent job, I love the product and would highly recommend it to anyone.  I've had several hundred LPs sitting in boxes in the basement for years and now I'm rediscovering that music all over again as I transfer the LPs to the digital age.  

The quality of the transfer is very good (imo).  For example, I was playing back So. Central Rain (early REM) in ITunes and noticed that I had purchased the song on ITunes about a year ago.  Except for an opening click on the LP version, its very hard to tell the difference between the two.

My only minor negative (or really, feature request) would be for LPRipper to somehow integrate and automate song titles from the albums so that I don't have to type them all in.

I ordered the wrong Spanish Language Learning Sucess kit for my husband for Christmas.  Although he had taken off the outside wrap, Rosetta Stone graciously allowed us to return the set I had given him and in return they sent us the version he had originally wanted.  Rosetta Stone made the return very easy and fast

I've only just started.  But so far, I am very pleased with this language program.  My only regret is that I don't have enough time to keep at it.  The various learning modalities are quite useful-this is the only program (aside from taking a class) that i've used which does this.  I recommend it

What I like about this software is that it does not come with too many "gadgets." At my age, I am "technically challenged." So this software worked out fine for me with my limited computer skills. I also like the fact that this software covers Castilian Spanish. It is probably the only course available that exclusively covers Castilian Spanish in such depth since Pimsleur and Learning Like Crazy only offer Latin American Spanish courses.  
The downside of this software is that you will not learn much Spanish grammar with it. If you want to learn the rules and mechanisms required to combine words and form sentences in Spanish, you will have to buy a good Spanish grammar book. For that I strongly recommend Spanish Grammar for Independent Learners by Avigail Azoulay, Arie Vicente. It is more expensive than other Spanish grammar books but it is well worth the money.

Streets and Trips has been a significant help in making our travel plans. We use it in conjunction with our Garmin 2720 GPS system and they are very complementary. The Garmin system doesn't use downloads from the laptop and Streets and Trips therefore allows us to do trip planning on a braosder scale at home. This is a very good program for trip planning

Although I did not purchase this product from Amazon.com (...), I absolutely love it.  The GPS locator provided is amazing and better than I thought it was.  It is not one of those GPS that updates your position every 20 seconds or something, but when I zoomed in I could see my current location constantly moving on the map (so it is updating every second)...I have ridden with deputies in my county as part of an internship and the GPS provided to them isn't even this good.  I recommend this software and GPS to anyone

I travel a lot; this product saves me valuable time in unfamiliar surroundings.  I have my laptop open on the seat and plot my position and where I want to go - it's easy!  If I miss a turn, the "reroute from present position" feature is great!  It takes a little getting used to, but if you tend to be more visual, or you don't generally do well with maps, or maybe you just want to know where you are in relation to where you're going -- MS Streets and Trips is tops

Used this for a trip from NW of Chicago to Houghton, MI (in the U.P.) and it worked fairly well except through some hilly sections (lost signal a few times). This works best when you have two people (driver and navigator) as looking over at a laptop while driving isn't a good thing! Would have been even better with voice prompts but at the price I wouldn't expect it

This is a cool game in a lot of ways.  I was jazzed about it because of the era it represents.  But the complexity and inscrutability of the setup menus is somewhat offputting.

The huge disapointment, however, is this:  The online registration code is missing.  Utterly missing.  And there is no resource available on the net to help.  The U.S.A. help number is disconnected.  You will not be able to play online.  Period.  The developer's forums are full of posts about this problem.  No resolution....  Beware.

Demand more of the makers of the products you purchase.  This is extremely bad

SimBin makes an excellent simulator. This game has brought me back to days days of yesteryear in great delight. The physics, sounds, and graphics are top notch. The game is fun and the ranks seriously tough. Online capabilities are fine except you have to unlock cars and tracks through the game, which could take weeks

This is no GTR, but it shouldn't be either.
Being a huge Simbin fan I have to say the GTR series are still the best. 

Although there are times when GT Legends historic cars can be quite the challenge, and really a blast to drive....and in the end, thats what its all about

I bought this product based on my research of users opinions and found it has lived up to their high opinions.  I have boxes of family photos as well as numerous camcorder tapes of family events.  I wanted an easy comprehensive program that would let me arrange photos and video clips, add music and burn on a DVD.  This program does it all and more.  It may not do everything extremely well, but for the price, well enough to put out an impressive DVD.  After about two hours of getting familiar with the program, I was able to create a DVD that had 35 pictures and a video clip with background music - stunning results.  I played the DVD on several different brands of DVD players and had no problems.  Looks great on TV.  I've had no problems running the program on my computer - I'm running this on a Pentium IV 2.9 GHz, 1 gig ram and 200 GB ram HD.  Since I am a beginner/weekend hobbyist, this suites my purpose of sharing pictures with family - I'm finding much better to share on DVD than paper photos.  For an all-in-one package at this price, it does the job very well and I would recommend it.

A great new interface including control layout, easier than ever to use, and complete. There is no other product in this class. It looks great in XP and even sharper in Vista.

Subject to some agreement with Adbobe, you'll have to download the free PDF writer from Microsoft (the beta came with it), but it works exactly the same and otherwise no suprises.

The product is pricey and you may want to purchase a smaller release (less applications in the suite) depending on your needs

I am a user of Acronis backup and very satisfied with it and was hoping that the Disk Director would be the same however it is a little more complicated to use, I partitioned a drive then wanted to convert back and have not yet be able to do so, I know that you can but just haven't found out how yet, it could have been made a little more simplier to use

Excellent software to manage your large backup hard drives. You can format, partition, split, merge and a whole lot of other things. If you purchase a large backup hard drive I recommend this software and the Acronis True Image software. With both, you can partition your drive and have a ghost copy of your c:\ drive in one partition and daily backups of My Documents in another. This way in case of a HD crash you have a bootable backup. (Note that the software that comes with backup hard drives will not make a bootable backup of your hard drive.) Thats why I recommend both Acronis software packages

I am a Friends fan and I really enjoyed this game. The questions vary in difficulty, and the narration by the characters is a nice feature.

Regarding the issues with the keyboard, the keys for each player are indeed very close together. Also, when two players can answer the same question at the same time, it's easy to press the wrong key by mistake. But I guess in time you can get used to the keys.

I didn't have a problem installing the game, although I have a CD recorder and recording software installed. I didn't choose the full instalation, since the CD has to be in the drive anyway, but the game runs properly, it didn't seem to freeze when reading from the CD.

Compared to SceneIt, it's very different. This is a complete trivia game that keeps score and announces the winner. SceneIt is a board game, and the DVD is used to ask questions, and in order to play it as a trivia game you need to keep score with paper and pen

This DVD-Rom game is so interesting and there are even some questions that I don't know after watching every episode numerous times.  I highly recommend this for Friends fans of all ages, regardless of whether or not you have seen every episode.  Also, I love that the game can be played by only one person, for those nights that you find yourself alone and want a few Friends to keep you company

QuickBooks Love Hate Relationship - Insight From Long Time User

Love the program.... Hate the company!

I've been using QuickBooks for more than 10 years.  I started with the basic edition since I am a very small business and use only a portion of the program, specifically Customer and Vendor Lists, Invoicing, A/R and Purchase Orders.

OVERKILL is an understatement... QuickBooks Pro is much more powerful than I need.  I don't use Payroll, Check Printing, Year End Accounting and many of its other functions.  SO WHY DID I PURCHASE SUCH A POWERFUL PROGRAM?

That's the "rub".  Intuit is not satisfied with its QuickBooks users being content with the edition that they are using; Intuit sales people call all too frequently trying to get you to upgrade to the next higher version (edition) of their program.  They hounded me for years to upgrade from the early basic edition to the then current basic edition; finally, they dropped support of the product and I had no choice.  

I purchased QuickBooks 2005 Basic Edition in 2005.  Shortly after purchasing it, they informed me that they were no longer going to support the 2005 Basic Edition and if I wanted continued support I would have to upgrade again, this time to the Pro Edition.  

This January (2007) I received an email from Intuit informing me that my 2005 Basic Edition wouldn't run on the new Windows XP Vista platform and if I switched to Vista I would need to upgrade to QuickBooks Pro.  I upgraded to a new PC in February as the result of a major crash on my former system and opted to go with Vista, thinking that I could install Windows 98 as a second operating system to run QuickBooks 2005 Basic.  The second operating system didn't work out and, after seriously considering switching to Microsoft Accounting 2007, I purchased QuickBooks Pro.

I was very disappointed that Intuit didn't offer a significant purchase incentive to existing users; but they never have in all the years that I've been using their product.  Even Microsoft, the shark of sharks, offers incentives.  DON'T BE MISHEARTENED.

I purchased the program from Amazon and, with rebates and other purchase incentives, saved $60 over Intuit's price; I could have saved an additional $25 if I had bought on eBay (had I known it at the time).

I upgraded from the 2003 version with no major problems.  The 2007 version is a bit easier to use and works just fine for my small business. The security, however, is not great for a mid-sized company. Since my accountant fully supports the product, they are always available for support

I have used this product for over a year now.  The reason I bought it was for the back up software.  Email was a secondary consideration.  Let me talk about the back up for a moment.  It is quick to download and about that easy to start using.  The set up can be done in two ways.  Either by default, or manual.  I chose the default version which covers my home folders and it automatically backs up everything to my external hard drive at a time of my choosing.  It will also set up a seperate version of a back up of vital stuff to an online storage for you that you get when you buy .mac as well.  Restoring a lost file couldn't be easier.  just click on restore and the locate the file (or files) you want to restore.  The program is set up so that everything is named exactly as you originally named it on your hard drive.  You don't have to look for your file name in a long string of code.  Just select it and click restore.  It will either put it in the exact place of your old file or in new location of your choosing.   I haven't really messed with the other features yet, but the email is spam free and has been my default email for over a year now with out any problems.  Hope you buy the service and will enjoy it as much as I have

A couple of years ago, we completed the transition over to the Mac platform in our household.  Both my wife and myself have a desktop and a laptop, so leveraging the .Mac service to keep our personal configuration settings synchronized across computers has been fantastic.  Further, with the sharing features that are available, we each have access to view the other person's address book or calendar.  

One of the great features of the .Mac service is how it is tightly integrated into the operating system.  In addition, since the Synch Services capabilities in the operating system are documented and open, third party programs can write plug-ins that can leverage .Mac to propagate settings to different machines.

My favorite feature (and the catalyst for my initial subscription) is the Backup application.  As someone who has suffered the inconvenience of crashed hard disk drives far too many times, I wanted a simple, comprehensive, easy-to-use solution that I could use to backup my data to an external hard disk drive on a daily basis.  I've used other Mac-specific programs before and none are as easy to use as the Backup you get with .Mac.

The only real critique I have for the .Mac service is the amount of space available on the iDisk.  When services like Google Mail can offer 2.7GB of space for free (granted it is supported by advertising), it makes the .Mac the space available with .Mac seem meager.  Of course, considering a full backup of my data/settings takes up about 8GB of space, I may be outside of the demographic that the .Mac service is targeting.  However, in this age of digital media (pictures and movies), the amount of disk space people need for their "memories" is only going to go up.

But I guess that is why they have external drives and DVD burners

I have had .Mac for years and enjoyed using its functions.  I have a number of photo pages hosted as well as some iWeb sites.  Plus I use it for syncing and backup, etc.  I am not a power user, however.  But it's a great utility and particularly when you have other family members who you want to have access it some of its features easily.

High Fives to PaperPort 11 Pro!  Being in a business where I am constantly told to print this and print that off of one website and another,  a product like PaperPort Professional 11 has really come to my rescue.   The product has given the opportunity to do something with a document, picture, or file other than printing 

Now when I  select the document or file and hit my print option button,  I now can print it to a multi-page PDF,  If I choose to do so. Files that I download, scan, save, or  archive are no longer just random clutter on my hard drive,  I can retrieve the information from  them effortlessly using the product's powerful search engine.

I was thrilled to find that its All-In-One Search Engine was able to work with files generated in many MS Office applications.  All I needed to do was remember some of the content text and the PP Pro 11 would find the file for me.

Now I'm stacking individual MS Office Files into logically-named PDF groups or using the product to search the web and retrieve information of interest, I find  PP Pro 11 to be well worth the money and my time to use it.

I read horror storied about 7.0 Nero so I upgraded to 6.6 from 5.5 by going to the Amazon new & used market.  This is a good program that does all you need for DVD's and CD's.  It gets good reviews.  I can't imagine what happened to 7.0 but they may have gotten carried away with "user friendly-ness" - I see a little of that in 6.6 compared to 5.5

6.6 Ultra is an extremely good CD/DVD burning suite.  It even has an excellent schedule-able backup/restore utility that burns to disk.
Do NOT use the OEM version - it's like diet Nero.  And do NOT for ANY reason get Nero 7.0.  You have less than a 50% chance that it will work at all.  (I am speaking from experience here!

Nero 6 is a wonderful product, but you need to get a legal copy of the full retail version, not an OEM CD or a CD of questionable origin. At this time (April 2006) the best place to get it is from the Ahead Software website (the makers of Nero). (You can get a retail box of Nero 7 just about anywhere, but Nero 6.6 seems to be more stable and provides all the functionality most users will need.) You can download a demo, then purchase a serial number to unlock the full product. It's a smooth, easy transaction. After many headaches I discovered that the OEM version that came with my DVD burner would allow me to capture video from my camcorder, but wouldn't let me burn them to DVDs. My choice was to either buy a CD of questionable origin (and one that is almost certifiably illegal) on eBay, purchase a DVD burning plug-in from Ahead Software for $24.99, or purchase the whole suite for $80.00. I chose the latter. Using my installed OEM version, I purchased the serial number, entered it into the product (very easy to do), then downloaded the latest updates, and I was off and running. This software produces very high quality DVDs and can burn a disk in 15 to 20 minutes using an inexpensive 16x NEC DVD burner. I am now a happy consumer with a stack of DVDs containing transferred videos of great quality

As a retired teacher, I wanted the ability to compose a song and share it in a pristine form.  Finale SongWriter does that.  The lyrics find their way to the correct note.  The Midi connection works and all the parts of a composition is enveloped in this software. One of the attractions for me is the cost.  Finale SongWriter does not extract your final dollar from your stash.  Try this program, and you will find many facets hidden that makes Finale SongWriter a positive

Look, notation software is notoriously expensive.  All musicians know that.  So, when you see SongWriter and its price, it's a relief.  Everything you need is in this program.  I only have one complaint.

When adding an expressive dynamic (p,mp,mf,f,ff,etc.) you have to add one to EACH note to insure proper playback.  That is a concern of mine since I use SongWriter to notate songs and export them in MIDI for recording purposes.  It leaves an ugly looking score.

Other than that, this is the best deal on the market for what it is

With a per-user price of $8.33 (when priced at $24.99 for 3 users), this is a wonderful deal and was just what my 6-computer office needed. It was easy to install and appears to work well. My staff loves the anti-spam feature.

I got a hold of a Windows Vista Ultimate disk.  It gave the choice to install Home Basic, Home Premium, Business, or Ultimate.  I installed Vista Home Basic, because I only have 512 MB of RAM. 

Likes:
I like the new wallpapers and the way it looks.  My Documents and My Music folder remind me of iTunes.

Dislikes:
Don't like that my less than 6 month old HP printer doesn't work with Vista and my USB net link cable doesn't work with Vista.  When you install something screen slowly fades out and then a window comes up asking you if you want to run the program and trust it.  It's a little annoying because it forces you to stop what your doing and answer the question before you can continue.  

Verdict:
I like it, but the incompatibility issues are enough for me to want to stick with XP. I wouldn't buy Home Basic.  If you really want Vista, buy a new computer with Vista preinstalled or install a trial version of Vista to make sure everything works.  I'm going back to XP, until HP releases Vista drivers for my printer.

I'll write reviews on Home Premium, Business, and/or Ultimate if I ever get more RAM.

Some existing programs, such as Norton System Works, are not compatible with Vista and Norton insists that you pay for an upgrade to the 2007 version. Other than the compatibility issue, Windows Vista Home Basic works fine for me.

At home, I've been a Mac user since 1991. I also have been something of a Linux fanatic too and have used several distros, mostly Red Hat and now Fedora Core. At work, however I have used MS-DOS, Windows 3.11, 95, 98 and XP. It's fair to say I have never liked Microsoft. But on a laptop I use at work (an older Gateway 400VTX with a 2.2GHz Intel Celeron), I just upgraded to Vista Home Basic. I also upgraded the memory to its maximum 1GB. And despite my years of eschewing Microsoft, guess what? I must say I really like the OS. It runs fine on my slower system and I had no problems installing and no conflicts with drivers. 

I think Microsoft has really made a "cool" OS

I was hesistant to upgrade to vista for a while but I decided to invest and see what the hype was all about. I have a P4 HT 3.0 Ghz with a good video card and after upgrading my current desktop to 2 GB of ram, I found that vista runs really well on my machine. I bought the home basic because microsoft advised it and I dont need any of the other features offered in premium. I love the graphic capabilities of vista and the functionality is really nice. I had no problems using any of my programs and had to only upgrade my video and sound drivers after installation. Vista installed all of my updated device drivers for me as well. This is definitely a solid OS and I would highly recommend upgrading to vista if you have the recommended hardware requirements

I have been using McAfee products for the last 7 years. I did not have any problems with viruses, but it is true, I try to stay out of dubious web sites. I purchase my McAfee software from Amazon every year because of their rebates and every time I see 1 - 2 star ratings. It is unfair. Their products are excellent.

I have installed McAfee Internet Security Suite 2007 on two computers so far. The first one is a Dell laptop. I unistalled the previous 2006 edition and Ad-Aware (since Ad-Aware and the 2007 ed. are incompatible) and the installation was perfect. Not the least problem.

I ran into problems though with my desktop. I have tried to remove the 2006 edition and I could not find a remove button in Windows' Add/Remove Progrmas. I poped the 2007 ed. in and it said that it will remove the old products automatically. After the instalation the Firewall did not work. I noticed that somehow the old 2006 ed. was still there. I went to McAfee's web site and I got a removal utility that got rid of all McAfee products on my computer. Another great tool I used off of their web site was "Virtual Technician" which told me that the entire installation was messed up. However, after cleaning up with the other utility I did a fresh installation and everything works perfectly.

It took me a few hours to get a hold of the problem, yet I love to play with computers.

McAfee should not be hold accountable for a product that performs excellent in normal conditions. I continue to trust McAfee's products.

I love the cleaning utility. It is very thorough. I plan to use it every day before visiting banking and financial sites. It cleans all of your internet traces.

It takes a while until you get used to where all the tools and settings are placed, yet any new complex bundle of software would present you with the same challange.

I hope that the 2008 edition will have the anonymizer built in. It would be a great tool.

In the end, protection is what it matters, and McAfee Virus Scan and Personal Firewall have done it for me for the last 7 years

I have used McAfee antivirus for years and it is an excellent product.  I bought the suite this time and found it will not allow you to run a different firewall (ZoneAlarm) in my case.  That is the only negative I have found so far.  The McAfee firewall seems sufficient so far

I am an adult trying to learn Piano.  This program is great for learning simple songs and does have a very good feedback system.
The lessons are taught with plenty of simple songs which you can play and the feedback system will track how well you play.  The feedback system tracks your key presses, rythem, and note length.  However, it does not track the strength of your key press.
I would like to see more exercises to develop better basic skills, instead of just playing simple songs.  Also, the feedback program can be very discouraging for children as it is very sensitive and report very minor error.
Overall, this is still a great program to have for self learner, but in no way will it beat a real piano teacher

I received my eMedia Piano and Keyboard Method today and it's not a bad program by any means, however I have two gripes with the software: 

First, either the "full screen" option in Preferences doesn't work or eMedia feels that 640x480 counts as a full screen, so if you have your monitor set at a higher resolution (and what Mac user doesn't?) you'll need to lower it in order to read the lessons' text, and since you most likely won't be sitting as close to your laptop/monitor during these lessons, this is kind of important. 

Second, You need to have the program CD in your computer to get the sound and video to play, and the whine of my optical drive is mildly annoying while trying to study/practice. There are workarounds to bypass this type of copyright protection silliness, but it makes me mad that I need to resort to doing this. If eMedia's so paranoid about theft of their product, why don't they just stream the program's media portion from their website?  At least it wouldn't be noisy that way.

Other than these two flaws, the program is excellent for self-starters like me. Plus it seems to be the only complete, low-cost piano/keyboard instruction software out there for Mac OSX. I would have wrote this review after a few weeks of lessons instead of my first day learning but the optical-drive issue really bothered me.

I thought that I could never learn piano on my own. All the material that I ever looked into either didn't have enough information in it or was too complicated for its own good. Because of this software, I am constantly learning new things, and slowly improving my skills as a future pianist. If you are a beginner, you want to buy this software. It's done wonders for me

This CD is a MUST HAVE! You cannot afford to NOT buy it. The information is comprehensive and easy to follow. The format is perfectly set up... you can review a section many times if needed. Every family and individual in America should view this CD to know what to do when a terrorist attack occurs... not IF, but WHEN, it occurs. For instance, before watching this CD I had no idea you could use regular household items like dish soap or bleach to remove radioactive materials from your skin, but these items will make chemical burns worse. I feel much better having this knowledge from the CD, and this is just one example of the useful and critical information I learned. The preparation checklists on the CD are awesome for planning ahead. Knowledge will be powerful in protecting yourself and your family in the event of another attack

I'm an amateur at website design/building, so understand that I'm not very "deep" in Dreamweaver's abilities. However, I got the program to switch from Adobe GoLive CS2 which had many quirks, bugs, and frustrations. (One example - while you upload your changed files to the web server in GoLive, you can't do anything else in the program. Single tasking!?!?!) After just 30 minutes or so of working with Dreamweaver to update my site, I'm already sure I've made the right decision! I have a long way to go in learning what it can do, but my first impressions of the product are excellent

Easy to use, with more tools to make your web pages look great, even for a beginner.  And there is a lot of support and tutorials on the web to help you out

I'm a hobbyist musician and like to do home recordings. This program fits all of my basic needs. This is the first piece of audio software I've ever owned but I know a lot of people who are more experienced are very unhappy with what I guess are unconventional layouts and commands so be warned if you've used Audition 1.5 or CoolEdit. However, as my introduction to music editing, the control scheme seems very intuitive to me and I like the endless options Adobe provides for organizing the workspace. One tip: if you are a student or teacher, don't spend $300; do a google search and find a site that sells this product for a little over $100.

I am satisfied with the product.  For that matter I know it before I bought and I am satisfied with it.  The only glitch is it will take some time to start and until it starts we may not be able to browse or use any applications that needs internet.  Still I would suggest it is a best option to buy one for ur computer safety

Over all I am very happy with the product. It has paid for itself in this short time by just making Happy Birthday cards. I am not totally happy with the product and I am not sure if I would buy it again. The product is well worth the money you are paying but their is a few things which I am not happy about: 
1. Even though the product gives you CD's which contain Art and Project Models their is more art and projects on the Internet. To access these art and projects you need to go on the Internet which is not a problem. What is a problem is that if you want to get on this site and a lot of other people are on the site already you may not be able to get on the site. If you cannot get on the site you cannot finish your project. You will have to put it away until some other time when you can get on the site. This is frustrating and annoying. It makes you want to take the entire program and through it out the window and buy another brand.
2. The other thing I was not happy about was, I was given a coupon, in the box, for a 1 year membership to the "Million Image Club" To get into this club you have to fill out some paperwork and submit it on the Internet. After it is reviewed you are then sent a pass word, over the Internet, that allows you to go on the site. Well, I filled out all the paperwork, sent it in over the Internet, as required, but was not sent a password. Well, I tried to find some one to talk to about this but ran into a brick wall after spending a lot of time being directed from one site to another only to end up with no answer to the problem. It seems that Broderbund does not control the product but "Encore" does. You will receive almost no help at all from "Encore". The only place to get help is from a Forum which couldn't give a reasonable answer on what I should do. So, I am now not getting access to the "Million Image Club", to tell you the truth, I don't really care. When you finally can get on the site you have hundreds of images and models to choose from. You really don't need a million more.

I have been using Printmaster Platinun for several years and love it. I scrapbook constantly using all of the features. I have printed thousands of items with this program. If  people have problems with the program it is because it uses alot of memory and the problem is their computer.  I have gotten rid of 10 scrapbook, photo programs and only use Printmaster. There is no better program.  Ann

I've been using PrintMaster for years to create greeting cards, party invitations, banners and posters for my kids' school. This version has a lot of great new art and images and my son has even made personalized cover for his iPod. I'd reccomend it to anyone who likes PrintMaster or wants to create great-looking projects at home

I chose Office Ultimate 2007 as it seemed to not only have everything I could possibly need to run a business, but also easy functionality that would keep me from pulling my hair out because of software or design issues.

Ultimate 2007 certainly doesn't disappoint!  

- Set up was fairly easy:  two disks came with the package.  Disk One contains most of the software and Disk Two contains applications that guarantee that you are the owner of the software and have the right to all of the Accounting and key business functions.  

- Ribbon technology removes the old "hunt and find" menu method (although for those of us that took the time to memorize and learn the location of every buttom and drop-down it did take a day or two to get used to the new set up).  

- Integration with the web and other programs is virtually seemless.

- Excel is no longer the chore it once was because of the above mentioned ribbon.

- Accounting software is included.

- Ink and Crossword.  I'm not one for games on my business pc, but for anyone that likes to doodle or zone out with crosswords, ULTIMATE lives up to its name by including an art program designed for pen users and excellent crosswords.  

- OneNote.  I like post-its (perhaps a little too much *L*) and always used the Post-It Note software on my business computer to keep notes.  I used OneNote 2003 sparingly because I simply found the Post-It Note software easier to use on my desktop, BUT...with my Tablet PC One Note 2007 added a new dimension to my notetaking that I feel will work well with my business:  the earlier mentioned web and application integration and handwriting to text functionality.  I may still use Post-It now and then for quick notes or perhaps the Windows "Stickys," but the long note pages, pasting of images and other web info, and pen to paper note taking makes this product invaluable.

- Word.  What can I say?  This is my primary software tool and I use it on a tablet pc.  The 2007 applications were made for my computer type.  I can easily click on formatting tools with the touch of my Wacom pen and I don't have to stop mid-thought to make a change or wait until I finish the document to then make my edits.

- PowerPoint, Publisher, Access, Groove, InfoPath et cetera (also included): I am still delving into these, but they appear to have all of the perks of the other programs.

So, did I have any dislikes?  

1.  The INK program doesn't respond to my Wacom pen as well as the Windows journal or Microsoft OneNote.  It also doesn't have easy to use tools within the software. Since it was an "extra" and will not be my primary desktop publishing, design, or art tool - I'll probably remove it at some point from my tablet. 
2.  Microsoft does not include an instruction manual or reference book with this program.  As a result, after installation of the first disk and Microsoft's statement that all of my programs were installed, I couldn't find my Accounting software, had no idea that the Accounting software was on the second disk (the second disk, when loaded, doesn't mention that the software is on the disk until AFTER the software installation is complete and instead mentions other business applications), and wasted over an hour trying to find it.  Also, I'm a "hands on" person and although I have access to the internet whenever I need it, I enjoy having an actual book in my hands from time-to-time while learning.  Ultimate is made with enough simplicity that a manual isn't really necessary (i.e. most questions can be answered by the "Help" window), BUT...for the hefty price tag, I don't think it would have been too much to ask Microsoft to include a basic "this is how you install the programs and this is what to expect" booklet. Also note:  athough Microsoft, through their downloads e-mail updates, provided a "Getting Started" tab with a "how-to" for each major software applications, the tabs had to be added "after the fact" and many of you might find yourselves frustrated with the lack of upfront instructions on how to use the software.

Beside those few quirks, I fully stand behind my 5 star rating of this product and purchasing this product through Amazon (i.e. Amazon's pricing was less than the big boy retailers or online vendors).  

Shipping turnaround with Super Saver:  2 days.

For the first time in several versions Microsoft has changed the file format.  However, it is for the better.  The new files are all compressed using the ZIP compression format so files are MUCH smaller (old files are 3-4 times larger than new files).  The new file formats are supposed to be compatible with a cross platform specification (i.e. Linux geeks can open Office documents).

The new interface is RADICALLY different.  Do not install this if you have a large project to complete.  The interface is SO different you will not complete on time.  However, after a month of so you will wonder how you ever got along without it

Having used the Office programs for some time, I was a bit put off by the new ribbons which replace the old menus.  I guess that Office needed a new look, but I am not sure if I buy the advertising that the ribbon will make my work more productive.  

Some things that you should know about Office 2007 and Ultimate in general.  The licensing agreement allows you to install Office 2007 Ultimate on two computers, one of them being a laptop.  I found this clause in the legal agreement and even called Microsoft Legal to confirm.  

If you make modifications to the Quick Access Toolbar (and who won't do that?) and you want to take these changes with you to another computer, the files for the toolbars are located at:

C:\Documents and Settings\username\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Office

Where username is your username.  Something I have found handy when working with my two computers.

One thing that I don't like is that the file name extensions have changed.  Gone is the familiar .doc for Word documents.  Now the file extension is .docx.  If you want to create a document that can still be opened by prior versions of Word, you must purposefully choose to create a .doc file, but you lose some of the functionality of the new files.  The .docx file This format is not the same as the OpenDocument standard.  Microsoft promises that older versions of Word can still open the .docx files, but I have not tried it and I don't buy into everything that Microsoft promises until I see it happen.  Why couldn't Microsoft just leave the files the same as they have always been?

Office 2007 does look slick and I anticipate that I will warm up to it in the future as I get used to the new command structure.

I read the review centering on the box the DVD comes in and must admit that I was stumped as well.  It was "different" but I don't foresee this as being a problem overall.

The new Office Ultimate 2007 loaded quickly.  How quickly?  Well, I had to check my new Vista HP notebook because I couldn't believe that it packed all of the programs onto the system in such a short amount of time.  It asked for the Product Key and one or two other bits of data but that was it.  Out of all the Office suites I have owned, this one loaded so quickly I was sure there was a problem.  Nope.  Access, Outlook, Word, PowerPoint, Publisher, OneNote, Excel, Groove and a host of others were there ready to be activated (don't worry; you only do it once, not for each separate program.  Naturally, if you are like me and totally dependent upon email, you'll activate Outlook first).  

The new Office "feels" different.  The ribbons are OK but I would suggest that they allow us the option to retain the Classic (XP) view.  I rely quite a bit on the RESEARCH task pane and I don't mind telling you that it was difficult to find.  The menu bar is a bit on the thin side and having so many icons on the top added clutter and confusion, at least for me.  Of course, finding the research task pane could have been quickly resolved if Microsoft had put a product manual in the box (yes, the online HELP is nifty but sometimes a man just needs to read about it from a manual instead of printing it out).

All in all you will find all of your old favorites.  And, true to the Office legacy, they really have not changed enough to warrant a major release but I'm willing to bet that after all is said and done, Office Ultimatae 2007 will become the industry standard

I'm a PC mechanic. I have been using Ad-Aware with Ad-Watch (now called Ad-Aware Plus) for the last 5 years.  It's pretty good at what it does, but there is newer technology that is going to replace it soon.
I've never had any problems with these program - it does NOT add any malware - it REMOVES it.
However, using Ad-Aware and Ad-Watch to their fullest does take some computer savvy - as it seems does any anti-malware on the market these days.
ALL of the other runtime problems the other reviewers here have reported are "fixable" by using the controls and tweaks in the software, so that you are not overprotecting your system - one example, the pop-up blocker in Ad-Watch is adjustable as to its intensity.  However, this requires changing TWO settings - one in Ad-Watch itself and one in Ad-Aware.
  
And, yes, at times, I have had to turn Ad-Watch off to download a file or see a popup I wanted.  Soooo?  Software these days is not as "automatic" as the companies would have you believe.  

If you're not willing to take the time to learn (which also means going to the company's online user forums and asking questions), just stick with what Windows offers, don't use Outlook or Outlook Express (major source of malware on PCs) and only look at websites you know are safe.  (Kinda like the safest form of sex is abstinence - the safest form of surfing is NONE!!!

For more than a year now, I have been using Ad-Aware. I love it. The program scans for spyware, adware, hijackers, keyloggers, and common trojans (but Norton is the one that takes out the trojans).

So far, I am happy with this product. Even though I have never had anything bad on my computer (just cookies...mmm, cookies), my friend sure has had his share with MiniBug, Axela, eZula, FunWebProducts, and some others, and Ad-Aware completely removes it. And it does it all for free (yes, you can get the personal version free at Lavasoft's website).

So what's something that Ad-Aware Personal doesn't do? Real-time. You'll notice on the personal version that if you click on Ad-Watch to enable Real-Time, it will state "Realtime protection not avaliable in the personal edition.". So, I checked out the plus edition.

So, I did a test on an old computer, and installed eZula. That's right, it didn't go through. Right when it reached, an Ad-Aware pop-up stated "eZula was found at C:/(whatever). Would you like to remove?". Wow! Amazing!

One thing that is doesn't do is block most pop-ups. This is dissappointing, mainly because competetors like SuperAdBlocker/SuperAntiSpyware has a great pop-up blocker along with everything Ad-Aware has. But, SuperAdBlocker doesn't have real-time, and Ad-Aware does. I'd recommend getting both.

For now, if the computer is in a school, hotel, or airport of such, getting the plus edition wouldn't be a bad idea. But if you just use it for home, just keep the free personal edition. There aren't that many spyware programs that do things virus do, but I HAVE SEEN SOME that restart computers and add odd programs, such things trojans do. Though, for now, if you're not using this for public use, just have Ad-Aware Personal SE. If this is for public use, this is a great idea, and you may also want to get SuperAdBlocker for extra spyware protection and an excellent advertisement blocker (hell, now that I think of it, even if you have adware and SuperAdBlocker, it will block the adware), and Norton or McAfee for viruses or trojans (actally, every computer needs Norton or McAfee, unless it's a Mac or something).

As for Ad-Aware, it's an excellent program, and it's highly recommended. Maybe in feature editions, maybe well see a pop-up/banner/flash blocker that SuperAdBlocker/SuperAntiSpyware has

Don't get confused by the licensing mumbo jumbo that comes on the package. It is the full version ready to be installed. Don't forget to plan out your disk partitioning strategy before you start. So far, I have not noticed a dime's worth of difference from the Pro version. It is working great.

However, the Vista coupon shipped with my package expired on March 15, 2007. Additionally, the coupon only applied to new systems purchased between October 26, 2006 and March 15, 2007, so don't let the Vista thing induce you

Don't listen to all that crap about how you should get Linux or buy a Mac instead of buying Windows. That will probably be the dumbest choice in your life. This is the full version of windows OEM software. Comes with activation code and Vista upgrade coupon to either Vista Home Basic or Home Premium. Bought from Tiger Direct through amazon.

My daughter loves Sims so I got this to help her improve her Spanish.  It is fun to play for adults, too.  The complete immersion method is more effective for learning a new language

When I tried this program out, I at first had some trouble running it. But Then I went to the website at: www.kutoka.com and click on the support tab and then select EasySpeak Spanish. They give you a link for the version of Flash 8 you need to run. After this everything worked well.

While some may have been offended by bathing suits. Not me and not my kids. There is absolutly nothing obscene here folks. 

This program is the best thing going for learning spanish quickly! And it is fun to use with the many games and puzzles that you work out with real life scenerios. Very artistic and fun. You can go to the bank, the hospital, and several different places, learn a new set of words and situations. that you could really use in a foreign country. My hats off to the designers and creators of this program. Well done!! Bravo! Muy Bien.

This product is amazing. After learning my husband was taking me to Mexico for our 25th anniversary, I was nervous about going into a foreign country without knowing any Spanish. This game is amazing. It is the fastest way to learn a language without the long drawn out grammar explanations. Afterall, I just wanted to learn the basics, phrases for restaurants, banks, airports, shopping etc. This game was so much fun, you couldn't tear me or my husband off the computer. We kept wanting to play because learning was so much fun. The phrases I learned contributed to a much more enjoyable trip and now I have enrolled at the local community college to further my Spanish. This product is perfect for any one travelling and wanting to learn the phrases and colloquial expression fast

What a wonderful game - addictive and motivating! If you want to be able to make original sentences, you might need something more in depth with a bit more grammar, but for "Eazy Speak" this is right on the target! Fun for any computer user!

I have not yet looked at all the documents included in this software. I appreciate the tutorial nature and the pro/con examples given. Since I am not a lawyer, I am a bit nervous about making legal decisions that would need a test in court to be sure I made the correct choices. I did complete the HealthCare Directive and it compares well with others I've seen used in my state. I need to learn more about estate planning and this is going to teach me the jargon and the proper questions to ask.

My only complaint is that I declined the free delivery option and paid for delivery so I would have enough time to work with it before my parents appointment with their estate attorney.  It did not arrive in a timely manner and I was forced to purchase a download version from another vendor in order to complete forms I wanted the attorney to look at.  It is no surprize that he was more interested in drawing up his own forms for my parents and charging $1000 for a basic package.

I decided to keep the CD anyway (when it finally arrived) just in case I have a hard drive failure.

The lawsuit mentioned in Mr John Matlock "Gunny" review has nothing to do with the quality or legality of documents created using Quicken WillMaker Plus software. Instead, it concerns the actions of an insurance agent who was found to have practiced law without a license. 

He used will-making software (not Quicken WillMaker Plus) to write a will
for an elderly client. The trouble arose because he created the will outside of her presence and arranged for her to sign it while she was hospitalized. Apparently she never reviewed the will. In other words, he acted too much like a lawyer. While the "unauthorized practice of law" is a vague concept, had the insurance agent merely recorded the woman's wishes and entered them verbatim into the software, there would almost certainly have been no problem.

There is no problem with using software to prepare a will for your self. Nor is there a problem with using it to create a will for someone else if you merely type in that person's answers at their direction. The main way to run afoul of unauthorized-practice-of-law rules is to give legal advice to or prepare documents for others without their express, detailed instructions.

There are several real advantages to using Quicken Willmaker software. 

1. The legal part of the software was done by Nolo. They publish an awful lot of do-it-yourself software, and are well respected (if you are not a lawyer). Nolos involvement helps to assure me of a quality product. 

2. The user interface, a fill in the blank approach with a lot of help screens, make the whole process quite easy and painless to go through. 

3. Besides the standard last will, the package includes a number of other documents that you may want decide you need. Among others this includes Living Trust, Living Will, Final Arrangements, Notice to Terminate Joint Credit Card Accounts, Child Care Agreement & instructions, and many more. 

Having said that, there are two problems with the software: 

1. If you live in Louisiana, your laws are based on the French system, not the English system and there is a caution on the box that says: 'Estate planning documents not valid in Louisiana.' 

2. There has been at least one law suit saying that if you fill out the will for another person, you may be practicing law without a license. Do a Google search on 'Heirs sue over will-making software' where someone apparently used this software to do a will for a lady.

I just used this program to make wills and healthcare directives for my wife and me. I have the book-CD version. I recommend it over just the CD, because it is a better financial deal, and you do not have to read a PDF online or print it out.
Here are some of the features that I thought were worth noting:
* The program divides a document into sections and shows you a list of those sections, indicating which sections you have done. You can resume the interview at the beginning of any section and make changes from that point on.
* After doing one will, you can go to the File menu and Save for Spouse. This creates a copy of the will with the spouses names interchanged. Then you can go through the interview and make any needed changes.
* In the process of answering the questions, the program accumulates the names of people you mention into an editable contact list. After you mention someone once, the next time you need them you can simply select them from a list. This is handy when doing the healthcare directive, which needs to show contact information, if you have already entered that information when doing the will. It is also handy if you decide to redo portions of either document. When working on one family member's document, you can import contacts from another's document.
* The program does not appear to provide the option to list of two or more alternate executors to serve one at a time in the order named. The only way to list two or more alternate executors is to have two or more of them serve together. This is ironic, since the program recommends having only one executor at a time. Although I wanted to name my wife, children, and then siblings as alternate executors, I decided to accept just having my wife and son as executor and alternate. If all of us die in an auto accident while taking a trip together, then there is hopefully time for the probate court to name an executor. It would just be more expedient to have one already named.
* I contacted customer support asking them to enhance the program to add an option to list of two or more alternate executors to serve one at a time in the order named. The response stated why they chose to omit that option ("The editors choose to limit the number of fields for Beneficiaries and Executors to prevent the program from becoming to unwieldy") and some options (export the document and add the language or return the program). I was disappointed that they did not embrace my suggestion (I disagreed that it would make the program too unwieldy, since they already allow you to list multiple Beneficiaries and Executors that serve together at the same time), but I liked that I received a prompt response that indicated they had read my note and knew what I was talking about, and that they gave an honest, direct answer.
* At the end of the interview you can review the document as it will print. You can then print it directly to a printer, or export it as plain text or RTF. Exporting to RTF is handy if you need to change the document (they advise against changing it) or print it somewhere else. However, the RTF is not identical to printing directly. I noticed two differences. (1) Pagination can be different, and as explained by the program, getting the pagination right is important for legal reasons. (2) The footer is always different: the directly printed copy says how many total pages, whereas the RTF one does not. If you cannot print directly to a printer, I recommend printing to a PDF to maintain the pagination and other features. If you do not have a way to create a PDF, get a free PDF Writer (search on that term). When you print the document to PDF, print it as prepress so you embed the fonts.

I was using other internet security programs in the past. All had their pros and cons. I decided to switch to PC-Cillin 2006 Home Security Pack and it is the best available!.  It has both virus and spyware protections built in. The scanning is quick and the updates are easy to get. Plus this home security 3 pack is able to be installed on 3 computers, a bargain. All in all I am sold on this easy to use and comprehensive software product. I highly recommend this product to all! Amazon.com as usual had the best price

First I would like to state that sooner or later every computer
user will come in contact with some problem with an Internet
Security program. They are human made and not 100% fault proof.

I study and work in the IT field and was first introduced to
PC-cillin through Trend Micro's product Housecall. Soon after I
tried out the trial and have finally bought the product. I LOVE
IT!

I have used several of the other "major" anti-virus suites
available and have had tons of problems with them. McAfee after
one uninstall had bedded itself so far into the computer that I
had to completely reformat the PC to gain functionality again.
Norton to say wasn't much better.

If you are installing on a "clean" PC where these other software
suites have not been, I have not had a problem. I have
installed/uninstalled PC-cillin many times each time running
smoothly.

The software has been a valuable asset protecting my PCs by
alerting me to virus threats and even hacking threats that were
not even on my network but on my ISPs network. As well as
protecting my network from one single computer that received a
virus by shutting off traffic to that PC. 

I can understand where some of the other problems reported with
this software may occur if the person a beginning user or just
unfamiliar with the framework of the software. But if you already
have some experience in how to set this type of software up I
really do recommend you give PC-cillin a try. 

It is a sleak program, easy to install, easy to customize, and
really goes above and beyond with alerting you to possible risks
and threats. 

With all its competitors out there I would choose PC-cillin over
the rest any day of the week

I've used several other protection packages over the years and am please to say that last year found trend micro.  Their internet protection is imho the best.  Easy to install, doesn't eat up system resources, updates regularly, doesn't conflict with other programs.

Currently installed on 6 systems and I have no complaints at all, only praise

I had to start version 9 without the user files from version 7.  Even without the user files version 9 more quickly adapts to my needs.  I can dictate faster and there are fewer mistakes.  This reduces the time it requires for me to write a letter or produce a document.  For these reasons I'm quite satisfied with the purchase

Microsoft Office Pro 2003 edition is a good product. It installed easily over Office Pro 1997. I haven't had any problems with it (yet). It relies heavily on online links, you probably should have a fast DSL connection or broadband if you are going to use the online links.
Update:
I am using Windows XP with Office Pro 2003 and today was disappointed to find that the Help menu is not as user friendly or helpful as earlier editions

I was happy enough with the function of Office XP, and held off upgrading for a long time.  What pushed me over was when I switched to using Outlook as my email client, accessing quite a few POP3 email accounts for various websites.  Getting a spam filter to work smoothly under that circumstance was nasty: I spent many hours in addition to the fees for programs that were clunky and could never be kept working.

Well, Office 2003's Outlook comes with it's own spam filter.  It works, it's simple and it's unobtrusive.

The other programs have a nicer look and a few bells and whistles, but the upgrades I appreciate most are in Outlook

I love this especially for it's basic qualities.  I originally started with the version where it could be put on a 1.44 floppy that I got from my dentist, went to version 2001 a few years later. With version 2001 my bank no longer would support downloads for that it, and I knew I would have to upgrade some time.  I was comfortable with 2001 so I was glad to find this 2007 was easy to adapt to just a bit sleeker but adding my ability to download from my bank once again.  For someone who doesn't have the need for all the extras this is perfect

(Review written by my wife, the user.)
I've happily used the Quicken Checkbook program for many years.  When we changed operating systems from Windows XP to Windows Vista, I was unable to get the Quicken 2002 version to work in Vista, so I purchased Quicken Basic 2007 and am totally pleased with the program.  The only feature I use is the Checkbook program and as far as I'm concerned, it's perfect.  I've never used the download from bank option because I prefer to review all posted transactions when the bank statement arrives. I use Edit Preferences feature to tailor the program to my liking and I couldn't be happier.  The price is reasonable, too

If you find iMovie complicated, this product is not for you.  If you prefer automatic quick solutions this product may not be for you.  

If you find that you would like more control of your video/audio than you find in iMovie but don't want to spend a lot of money, boy have you come to the right place.

I take quite a lot of home video (new baby and all) and found that iMovie would frustrate me when I couldn't do some more advanced tasks.

iMovie is a great intro product.  If you are new to video, use it until you find that you feel limited (many will never will get to that point).

When (and if) you find that you feel some constraints in iMovie, then move up to FCE.

A note for most, iMovie and FCE typically are not for DVD/Hard Drive camcorders.  They don't have the output necessary to directly connect.  You may want to check with your camcorder manufacturer to see what they have to convert the DVD/HD to content that is usuable in these products

I use this with a MacBook laptop with 2GB RAM without any performance issues. It is a great product for when you have outgrown iMovie but don't need the full feature set of Final Cut. I use it for both perosnal and work video production. No problems connecting and moving video of a Panasonic PV-GS500 video camera via Firewire. There is a learning curve but the basics are pretty easy to master.

This was given to my son who is going to be living in China this summer and presently knows no Chinese.  He's worked hard with this program and at least appears to be getting the tonal quality correct which is key in this language.  A microphone is a must with this program.  Only wish it focused on certain key words other than phrases that would never be used, like "an old man driving a car"

4 different methods to learn the language, I am able to do 2 lessons an evening one to repeat and one new. The only thing you have to do is sit in fron of the computer. Just listen and look and the key words will pop out at you and you just can not help but to learn the new language.

Very user friendly

This map and trip maker is about the same as their previous versions except to my dislike, it no longer supports Windows 98, which happens to be the newest OP that my old lap top can use.  It also still lists some restaurants that have been closed for two years.  The street maps it produces are accurate, except for a few minor glitches

The program is great.  Sometimes the GPS is slightly off though.  I'll be travelling on a major highway and all of the sudden it will tell me that I'm off route for no reason.  Not really a big deal, just annoying.  Other than that I recommend it as a cheaper version of a GPS sysytem if you own a laptop

This is the second generation of this software I have owned.  It is a great navagation tool, better than most online sites and can be used in the car.
I marvel at how up to date the roads shown are because in the Lexington, Kentucky area we have had a lot of new growth, with new streets and roads.
The software contains a lot of good eating and lodging places already placed on the map, so you don't have to do a separate search to find a place to eat or spend the night. Major points of interest are also on the map

I use my Microsoft Streets and Trips software to plan my route, intermediate stops, and destination for any travel via automobile or truck.  I am especially pleased with the ability to see and print a detailed guide for locating street addresses for those destinations with which I may be unfamiliar.  This is especially helpful for delivery of items to a customer whose business may be on a relatively remote street in areas that are difficult to find.
I have tried a few other software systems that claim to do what Streets and Trips does, and I found none of those sustems could equal or even compete with Microsoft Streets and Trips 2007

This was the only place I could find Turbo Tax where I did not have to pay extra for state tax.  I live in Washington and we do not have state income tax.  I even asked Intuit how to get a version without the state tax, they said that was not possible.  I have used Turbo Tax for many years and I will buy from Amazon again next year.

Too bad some people can not read and then blame someone else for problems they caused.  Sound like a couple of 5 year olds.

The only down side for me I received an email from amazon saying shipment would be delayed 15 days.  2 days later the software arrivied, right on the day amazon originally said it should.  Don't know why they sent the 15 day delay email

I find Turbo Tax to be the original and best income tax preparation program.  I really saddened to hear people knock it on here because they felt cheated that this version doesn't come with State tax features.  Well, if you are going to shop online, you'd better learn to read the specifications for products!  I came to Amazon precisely because I knew I'd be able to find what I needed, for less.  Texas has no State income tax, so I make sure that I buy Turbo Tax for Federal only.  

Thanks for letting me get that little rant off my chest

I've used TurboTax (or MacInTax in the early days) for over 15 years to do my taxes. Most of those years included some form of business income, requiring a Schedule C to be filed. TurboTax Home and Business is a terrific product, taking you from gathering documents, to educating you about the tax code and recent changes, to data entry, to electronic filing. It's the whole package.

One year, we used an accountant to prepare our taxes, because of a particularly unusual income situation with complicated tax implications. In the amount of time that it took me to write down by hand all the information requested on the accountant's form, I could have typed everything into TurboTax and had my taxes filed. Plus, TurboTax is less than the $250 average tax preparation bill. And that year I really missed the tax education I usually get by going step-by-step through TurboTax, giving me tax saving strategies for the following year.

Faster. Cheaper. Plus tax strategy education. That's why I'm using TurboTax again this year.

P.S. There's no income tax for my state, so getting the Federal Only version is saving me $10. Thank you, Intuit, for splitting that apart and giving me the option

I bought Adobe Acrobat 8.0 Professional for home use after having used an older version at work.  The software was very easy to install, activate, and register; and I liked the orientation program that explained how to use the features.  Since I am active with three community service organizations, I welcome the addition to my home computer for the convenience it adds to assembling mixed media "binders." This program makes it easier to email formal reports, create handbills and pamphlets, and post them to my web page.

At first I had some difficulty adjusting to the new interface. Once I got used to it though I find it a lot more useful and comfortable to operate.
It's a great step forward in all senses for Acrobat!!

We found the program to be easy to install and the lessons easy to retrieve. The lessons are presented in a variety of ways to accomodate one's learning style.  The accompanying text is not difficult to understand and is very helpful in explaining the basics of the program. We appreciate the repetition and the spiraling effect used as one progresses through the lessons. So far, we are pleased with the materials and have felt quite successful in learning some basis phrases.

Drills are excellent, vocabulary has good variety... Picking up the grammar from the application without explanation is tough for me, but I guess that's the way kids learn any language.

I am fluent in Spanish. So, the Rosetta Stone Italian language software, was perfect for me. It is very easy to understand, to follow and to learn. If you study one hour per day, in one week you are going to remember several words and phrases. I don't have any regret at all, I think my investment was worthwhile.

I had the same problem with Works Suite 2002 that I had with 2006.  The product key that came with the discs would not install Microsoft Word;  the message "invalid product key" came up.  After a computer problem, I reformatted the drive and did a reinstall from the original Works 2002 discs. The invalid key message showed up when I tried to install Word 2002.  After arguing with Microsoft people for three weeks I bought the new Works Suite 2006.  After running all the discs to a clean hard drive, everything worked except,again,the invalid key message came up and wouldn't activate Word. Highly irritating.  I got it going by to Microsoft Works, Programs, clicked Word Document, got an "activate product" and got Word installed and running. This seems to be a dumb glitch in the software

Understand. I have a full MS New Office Suite that I got from work.   But choose to use this product for the many items included which can't be beat. If you just want to use Word and nothing else then get it alone. This is fine. But the other products are worth the discount and rebate also. Cost is the lowest I found. If you have a reward ceriticate using Amazon Credit card. That $25 more off the price. So in the end it cost me $30 for it. Shop smart and use any break you could get. Right?

When I got a new computer at the end of 2001, the 2002 edition was installed on my computer by Gateway. Although I never used Streets and Trips (and barely used Encarta), I used Word and Picture It! quite heavily.

Well, my hard drive died a few weeks ago, and I had to get a new computer. I bought Microsoft Works Suite 2006 to go with it. 

I was a bit apprehensive because Picture It! was replaced with Microsoft Digital Image Standard 2006 Editor. It took me a while to get fluent in Picture It!, and the idea of learning a new photo system was daunting. (I write mostly for the web, and use pictures to accompany my reviews and articles--as well as for eBooks.)

I haven't done any extensive work with it yet, but it appears easy to use IF you have experience with Picture It! If you've never used any image program before, it may be a bit confusing. (I feel that Picture It! was more self-explanatory.)

However, for all that the Works Suite gives you, I feel it's a good buy. Word 2002 has advantages over the older version (for example, you can easily insert images), and Encarta may be helpful for kids doing homework (or curious adults wanting to learn more about something).

Updating Encarta is easy as clicking a mouse: just open up the program and click "Update Encarta". New articles and updates will automatically be added to your computer. 

Although I *still* don't use Streets and Trips (I go to MapQuest reflexively), I still think this is a great Suite for a great price

I use MS Office at work, and at home, but for my daughter's computer this was perfect. 
Most people don't need the full version of office, and this package has so much for so little money.
The full version of Word is reason enough to spend this amount of money. Note: This is not the latest version, but who cares.
I would say this is one of the best software deals out there. Unless you need 100% office compatiblity, this is the package for you. If you do, buy the student and teacher version of MS Office. Read the fine print, it is for anyone not using it for business

It seems no longer possible to buy MS Word as a stand-alone program so to get it one buys Microsoft Works Suite.  This way one gets Word one version back from the most current version - plus Encarta, Streets and Trips, etc.  When purchasing be sure to distinguish between the CD version and the DVD version.  The latter comes on a single disk; the former on about six.  Also, note this is not the same as Microsoft Works - a suite of programs often preloaded on a new computer.  It has its own "peculiar" word processor, spreadsheet, etc.  For more than Word, look for the Student and Teacher Edition of MS Office Suite

This software is wonderful! I have been trying to find a good program to scrapbook digitally for many years. I've tried Broderbund (sp?) whose interface was too clumsy, Nova which was rather difficult at times (many things you can't do) and now this. When I first took this out of the package and installed it I thought I had made the wrong decision with this software since there were very, very few backgrounds, templates or embellishements even when I opened the Xtras CDs that came with this. I truly did not feel the Xtras CDs were worth purchasing since there are very few things on them. But then I found the tutorials that are included on the CD and watched the one about making collages. I didn't get halfway through the video - I had figured out how to do it. I have now created some of the best scrapbook pages I've ever made. Within hours I had a beautiful collage/letter to send with my holiday cards. My husband's first impression was a heartfelt "It's lovely". What has so throughly convinced me of the abilities of this software is that I can take ANY image and make it a background, I can create and manipulate text almost any way I want, I've been able to create my own embellishments as well as using downloaded embellishments from websites that sell it (.png format). I feel like I have no limitations on what I can do now. I imagine this software is not as sophistacated as Adobe Illustrator, but then it probably isn't as complicated to use (from what I remember that program has a rather steep learning curve).

You can also use the eyedropper tool to "pick up" any color from any picture, background, or element (read "anything") in the program. I was able to take the background colors and make embellishments that matched! I can take a color from one of my pictues and make a background that matches. You can also remove backgrounds from photos - it takes a bit of time to do, but the area around the image will be transparent - this functionality has many uses.  You can also save your files in many different formats including .jpg for file sharing, etc. There are so many more features I couldn't possibly list them here, nor would you want me too (too much time). 

If you only use premade templates and don't feel ready to venture out on your own yet this software may not be for you unless you find a website that sells templates for this software. You could start with something like Nova Scrapbook Factory Deluxe 3.0, which I liked, and when you start becoming really frustrated by its limiations it may be time to move up to this program. You may also want to read a book about digital scrapbooking to give you ideas and alert you to possibilities. 

The great thing about this program is that it isn't just for scrapbooking. You can do all your photo manipulation in it . I have always liked Paint Shop Pro so much that I haven't been able to afford to upgrade my copy since version 6, but I kept using that version. I'm so glad I got version 10 as it is very user friendly too. But please know that version 10 (which comes with this package) is not the most recent version. Version 11 is out now. If you don't want/need the Xtras CDs that come with this package you may want to just buy the most recent version and buy some embellishements from a website that makes .png files (portable network graphics format) or make your own. 

I hope you have as much fun with this software as I am having. I highly recommend the training videos on the CD - they really help

I am finding that it is not so diffucult to navigate my way around the new programs of Excel, Word etc. Opening up files - it tends to be a bit sluggish.  On the plus side I found Word 2007 seems to do a much better job of lining up indents.  In Word 2003 our indents were sometimes off by a half space which bothered us.

Office 2007 was a very nice improvement over previous versions.  The program was stable, for me at least, and the new interface was very nice.  It may take a few minutes to find where some commands have been moved to but the result was a much cleaner interface.  One thing that keeps in mind is that it uses a different file format from previous versions by default.  There is the option of changing the format to the previous version but the default option isn't compatible with earlier programs

Wow! I must say that the new office 2007 is way better than the 2003. It did take some time to get the hang of it because Microsoft changed around the icons and buttons. However, I do like it because now in Word, Excel, and Powerpoint 2007 you can creat charts and you can also preview how backgrounds look before appling to the slide. In the end, I think the 2007 is much more user-friendly than 2003. I recomend to anyone to buy this product if they wish to upgrade to the NEW 2007 Microsoft Office

If you're looking for a professional office suite, MS Office 2007 has no real competitors. I've worked extensively with Corel Office and some with Open Office. They're fine for the basics, and they cost less. But if you're looking for effectiveness, integration, speedy productivity, and an incredible array of tools, you'll want to buy MS Office 2007. And as an added bonus, the interface makes it a pleasure to work in

A quick look at the first several tutorials had me up and running.  I've been able to do most of the things I've wanted to do with this program and it's delivered on most of its promises.  My wife loves it too.

I have to remind myself that I'm not an architect and this isn't a professional program, though.  It does most things really well but it has some short comings.

I'm trying to draw my house right not which is a 4 level and haven't had any luck yet.  Although I've net seen all tutorials, I'm doubtful the program can do it at all.  Foundations have been difficult to manipulate at best.

My planned home addition includes a home theater and I've had to use work-arounds to get risers and sound insulated walls.  (Which messes up my already difficult to use cost estimator.)  But it has let me put in chairs, speakers, and a projector screen which makes the 3D views very close to what the finished product may look like.

The framing view is a dud as it appears to serve no practicle purpose.

So as long as you have realistic expectations from the program it should make you very happy.  Basic functions are easy to learn and my wife and I've had a blast planning our addition.  I can't imagine designing our addition/remodel without it.

I would buy it again

I have used other product of this kind and have never used any easier one.  The video tutorials are the greatest help of all.  The home plans they already have in the program are lacking but you can change them to what you want, but that is not the easiest task.  I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to make their dreams come true

I bought BHG Deluxe 7.0 software to plan an addition. I talked to the companies and shopped around before purchasing. I did not talk to IMSI about floor plan 3D, I gave up after trying to get through to a human. I would bet a guess the software is as good as IMSI's telephone skills. I talked to Punch Software and was warned away from their product by their own tech as I have integrated video on my computer. Apparently you need a video card with a minimum of video memory to render drawings with any usable speed using punch software. Punch Software's loss, not mine as that's a ridiculous issue for a consumer software product. Chief Architect offered a money back guarantee for their Better Homes and Gardens products, even if purchased via vendors like amazon. I'll keep this better homes and gardens home designer deluxe software, even though it does have it's annoying quirks. Even for a lesser package from the pro version, the library of items it very limited. I would guess there are quite a few more in the pro version, but it is odd to not include more of the most standard items that many home owners would need when laying out a home. You learn to just use a nearly matched symbol to fill the space, even though it is not the correct symbol or size of item. Since I am not interested in the 3D view, this is not a big issue for me. The item I needed most was floorplanning. 3D modeling is an extra item that I may play with, but is not essential for me personally. If you are truly interested in the 3D aspect, this is an issue. I would recommend visiting the product forum to see what is the best choice. [...]  For quick and easy floor plan software with a few extras, this software does better than OK. No experience necessary, and the short tutorial videos will get you started quickly. I have issues with not being able to have more control of wall types, and there are some odd roof design limitations even for a mid to low priced consumer package. These are annoying enough to urge an upgrade to pro if you want more  control of all aspects. Since I will be laying out the floor plan, then turning it over to an architect with real softare, it's not a problem for me. I have had a few restarts due to drawings getting all wild and messed up, but by ignoring the autosaved drawings, I was able to go back to my last manually saved drawing and start from a known good point. This software does have upgrade options to download from the company site. Just like any good software company, they do provide spftware patches to download. I would definately recommend this software as a quick way to do floor plans. Adding walls, doors, windows, and other items is very simple. Just don't plan on perfection, as it's based on prefabbed walls and is limited to whole inches, not fractions. Angles are an issue as well. If you need specific angles, this is not the package, it does preset increments only. I wish it had default preferences a user could select as well. Being able to preset your roofing style preferences or other items would eliminate quite a bit of redo's. I hope the software companies read these reviews. There is alot of good information on how to improve the products.

The engine behind this program is from Chief Architect, who, from what I understand, are developers of professional CAD software. It shows in this program. 

While this program has one of the best 3D walk around and capabilities, I tend to judge this and others by the drawing tools that it possesses. And this one has some good usable tools. 

Like most consumer level landscaping programs, this one has photo import so you can design around an actual photo of your home. Unlike other programs, the BHG software allows you to import and mask your own plant images. This is a great feature that my own program has which gives much better visualization with plants you might actually use. 

All the important stuff that we need to create a sellable visual landscape is there. For now, and with the choices I know of that are available to you, I find this to be the best consumer level landscape and garden program out there. 

This design software comes with an easy to understand tutorial CD. It was easy to install and start using right away. I think most folks would do quite well with this one.

I'm 9 years old and play this game frequently. I love to play it. It's not frustrating at all and it's totally exciting with many adorable animals. I didn't like her wardrobe in the beginning but then I bought a dresser and changed her outfit. The Pigs are fun to treat!!!!! They're smart!! The rabbits are soft and adorable; having my favorite animal being rabbits. I play this game for at least a half an hour a day and can't wait for the next time playing it!!!!

Get this game and try it out!! It's the best!

I did have to adjust my graphics acceleration to get the game to run smoothly, but it's a fantastic game. 

You get a building with your waiting room, exam room, living room, and bedroom. You build animal pens outside, buy medical equipment, buy books to learn about caring for each species, and need to manage your time to make sure you examine animals, sleep, eat, and for all animals that require a hospital stay you need to feed, care for, play with, and clean up after. 

It's a fun and well designed game

I have my own ATI primium TV tuner card so I tried the trial version on this software. But I realized that once one software is using a TV Tuner Card, it is difficulty to use the same device for other applications.

So, I purchased the full version of MY-IPTV which came with a USB 2.0 external device. So, I can also use it on my laptop notebook. I like this a lot.

This company boasts the feature to watch TV away from home. But I was very happy that I can watch TV from any computer at home as long as I have MY-IPTV in one of my desktop or stationary PC.

I would recommend this to folks who wathc TV on their PC or want to watch on PC like other techy guys out there.
I guess this turns your LCD monitor into a LCD TV.

I'm very impressed with how non intrusive this software is.  I used Norton for approximately 5 years before I changed to Bit Defender.  I didn't realize how bogged down my system was until I made the change.  The system scan is very quick (approx. 8-10 minutes in comparison to 20-25 minutes from Norton).  I don't even notice when the software is updating.  I'm very pleased with the program thus far and I highly recommend it

When my virus protection was about to expire, I was in a quandary.  I wasn't at all happy with the Norton I had purchased last year.  And, I wasn't especially pleased with the McAfee I had used the year before that.  When I checked the local stores, there didn't seem to be anything else to choose from.  I checked Amazon and found more options, plus plenty of customer comments to help me decide.  My son told me that BitDefender had been given the highest rating by Consumer Reports.  That, together with other customer comments on Amazon, helped me decide to give it a try.  So far, I'm delighted with its performance.  In fact, when I first installed it, it found a virus and some suspicious cookies that Norton never caught.  It doesn't appear to be interferring with my system operations (unlike Norton and McAfee), it and doesn't constantly interrupt with pop-ups and unnecessary warnings.  The best thing is that it gives me two years of protection for the price of one year with the other guys

The last reviewer didn't see any point to this software. Partially that's true---you don't need it to create your photostamp, you can do the same thing online. However, there is one big plus to the software product: buying a single sheet of PhotoStamps direct from their website costs $24.99 + $2.99 shipping, at this writing. In contrast, Amazon is selling this "boxed" version ---which includes a free voucher for a single sheet of stamps---for seven bucks less than that. Do the math

I thought this product was easy to use and produced decent results.  It works better than some of the more expensive software; I have tried at least a half-dozen similar programs, but I keep returning to this bargain-bin favorite.  For the money, it is an excellent value.

I bought this to use with family photos and threw together my first 5 page comic last night.  It was fairly easy to use, but not perfect.  Instructions are thin (read 'mostly nonexistant'); so it is best that you either have time on your hand OR a lot of experience using complex photo software.

GOOD:  Simple once you get the hang of it.  Plenty of fixed comic book panel formats to chose from and the drag-and-drop photo application makes life very easy.  As long as you are OK with the formats provided, then putting family photos into a fun comic book format is incredibly easy.  I received rave reviews from my first 'comic' and the finished product was of exceptional quality.  The sofware has a nice assortment of boxes, call-outs and even some fun clip art.  This was a great buy for the price.

NOT AS GOOD: The learning curve can be steep due to the quirky layout of controls.  I guess this is not too bad of an issue since there are few controls provided with the software.  The "dude" who wrote instructions was flippant at best (really annoying if you want to find a basic answer) and definitely not paid to produce a quality product.  Downloading photos was tough until I found out the trick - after that, it is quite easy.  

BAD: No photo editing software included.  Simple things like rotating photos 90 degrees had to be done prior to loading into Comic Book Creator.  The instructions and "Comic Book Wizard" are close to useless.  Did I mention the controls?  They are basic (good and bad) and poorly laid out (bad).  There is no ability to truly customize panel layouts; so this software will not help out if you want something really creative.  (Diagonals, overlays and more.)

All-in-all, this was an excellent buy for a software package under $20.  I created a great storyboard format of some fun memories - bringing a great laugh (and a few "wows") to my family, grandparents and friends.  Just be aware that there is a learning curve to get over before you hit the fun stuff.  If the software was more expensive, then I would have given it 3 stars

Actually, Comic Book Creator lets you use your content in a million different ways, including reselling of your work.  The only limitation is that you can't sell comics created around branded content--like images from Marvel, Paramount, TOKYOPOP, etc.--because they don't allow that.  It's all in the user agreement.

I own this program and for 20 bucks, it's outstanding.  Depending on what you want to do, you need to know that there are limits though.  If you want to just drop screenshots from your PC Game and make your own story, it's awesome.  If you want to drop your own photos or mess with the provided clipart, you can do that with ease as well.  If you want to make your own comic with your own pictures, that can get a bit tricky.  You need an art program like Photoshop, or scan your own drawings into the computer and put them in the clipart folder.  Then you can use them as inserts into the panels or as clipart, which allows you to overlap the panels a bit for a semi professional layout.  I have been working on a 24 page comic for a couple months (I have a wife and kid so there are limits to my time) and it's coming out quite nicely.  Now granted, this is not going to get you any contracts or deals with publishers but it's fun.  And anyone who loves comics and has wanted to make one of their own come to life, this is the key.

Most of the world still runs on PCs and as a Mac owner (and lover), it can be tough to find software for basic stuff like accounting.  I'm a guy who makes a living making stuff sound good for radio, TV, video games and so on.  As a freelancer, I need something to keep track of my business banking, credit cards, expenses and invoices and this program does just that and very intuitively, just like my Mac. 
I used MYOB--a Mac accounting program--but found it to be tricky and didn't end up with the comprehensive reports for my accountant that I expected and wound up going over everything expense by expense and invoice by invoice for hours.  It could be that I didn't understand the program well enough, but support is extra everytime you call customer service for help, so no thanks MYOB.  In fact, I put off doing most of my 2006 accounting until January 2007 because I dreaded trying to figure out MYOB again.  
Then I broke down and bought Quickbooks for Mac.  It did everything I needed it to--a year's worth of accounting in a weekend and I never even cracked the manual.  It allowed me to save the year as a PC file to hand to my accountant on a CD.  A few days later he handed me back a CD with a Mac file of my adjusted accounting and my corp taxes were done and sent.  
I can't speak for anyone with really advanced accounting needs because I never got that deep into the program, but for my needs it's right on the money.

I'm currently learning how to use this product; however, one of the first things I noticed was that the only way to do my payroll with it was to use a SERVICE.  Now of course, this SERVICE wasn't free and with only 4 employees, the last thing I wanted to do was expend $20 a month on a SERVICE.  Wasn't that the point of getting Quickbooks - so I could do it myself?

Now I can understand that tax codes, percentages, etc can vary from state to state, but would it have been so difficult for them to just set up a section with the generalized accounts and have the user input the amounts for each account needed on their payroll checks.  See, I'm not even asking them to have the computer calculate the amounts.  Simple would have been fine with me.

As for the rest of the program, it looks as though it will be fairly easy to use after I figure out the best way to set it up for my particular business.

I'm disappointed that a Business program designed for the small businessman would omit something as vital as payroll

I teach presentation skills, so I'm always on the lookout for things that make PowerPoint better.  I've tried and recommended other software in the past, but none of them have the power of Ovation.

This is an outstanding piece of software.  The visual effects are stunning, and it's so easy to use that a child could learn it in a few minutes.  PowerPoint is boring, and everyone's presentations look the same.  Not any more!  Full-motion backgrounds and effects really jazz up your presentations, and they have over 100 professional-looking business themes available.  See their website (seriousmagic dot com) for a demonstration of what it can do.  All you have to do is drag and drop your PowerPoint presentation on the Ovation icon, choose a theme and the effects, and voila! - a new presentation!

The current version 1.0 can not process embedded video or audio files, but they say that will be fixed with the first patch within the next month or two.  Despite that shortcoming, this is the best PowerPoint enhancement available - heads and shoulders above the competitors

MS put Office 2007 on a DVD rather than a CD so there is only one disk, so they make the installation easier right off the bat. Unlike all previous versions of Office, you do not have to get into the details of what options you want. In previous versions, if you didn't make sure you installed all the features, when you went to do a function that wasn't installed, you had to dig out your Office disks and install the feature. A huge pain, but not anymore.

The installation is hands down the easiest of all versions of Office. You don't have to tell it manually where to find your files. You don't have to manually put in your favorite buttons. It's all done for you. Yes it takes some getting use to the new layout of the functions, but once you figure them out, it is so nice and smooth. This version is light years better than all previous versions.

The most impressive part of the installation is Outlook 2007. In all previous versions, you had to EXPORT and IMPORT all your files and Contacts. Anyone who experienced this, knows that it never went that smooth. Sometimes it was awful and you lost emails and Contacts in the transfer, and the time it took to do this, was very painful. This is not the case with Outlook 2007. Just load the program and it does all the transfers  from your previous version of Outlook. You don't have to do a thing, and you're up and running without missing a beat when the program is done loading. You will be shocked how simple it is.

Anything new has it's growing pains to learn, but once you do, you will be very glad you made the change

I've been using this since the first beta release, and it has sped up my productivity at work by miles.  The ribbon interface is more upfront with the commands most ofter used, and my old keystroke commands are still there as well.  After changing my default save setting to 97-2003 I have run into no compatibility problems.  

As with most of the bad reviews on MS products, it seems people are quick to rush with a bad review when they are unable to find or do something as quickly as they have in the past.  My advice is to spend ten minutes looking through all of the menus...  They make sense, and once you get used to it, you'll never want to go back to the old way again.  Everything is cleaner, smoother, faster, and easier to use than ever before, and I have been using Office for longer than I care to admit.  Let go of the past people!  This is the future of business productivity

The new office 2007 is completely revamped from older versions and is well worth the four year wait.

+'s
1.New Interface with improved accessibility to all features, you can reach all the features that were hidden away inside those menus and no need to memorize the menu contents/options.
2. If you are a developer you can write your own custom panes using Visual Studio.
3. Great Plug-ins (like the save as PDF/XPS thing available as a free dwnld), massive clip-art/template library.

-s
1.Overpriced by about 40%. Somwhere around 250-300 wud have been the right price for the Pro Edition.
2. Some backward compatability issues with the document formats and templates and doesn't work with Adobe Acrobat as of now

I am enjoying the Talk Now! Learn Bulgarian CD. Great images, repetitive visual and auditory instruction make learning the basic words, numbers, time, etc. easy. Also, the games add interest. You can print out each section with photos and words in Bulgarian. However, I would have liked to see the program come with the Cyrillic alphabet and pronunciation guide.

I purchased this product needing to work on a personal legal (nonbusiness) matter, so the noncommercial license was fine for my "home" use.  Good thing I checked with Corel after buying it and seeing the "Home Edition" captions not only on the total suite packaging but underneath the "WordPerfect" and "Quattro Pro" components (inside front box folding cover with velcro).  Corel ultimately confirmed to me that "certain components that are designed for the business customer, such as Legal Tools, MetaData Removal, Document Compare, Quickfinder to name a few are not included in the Home Edition version."  Corel needs to make this clearer in their marketing of the "Home Edition."  I focused on the word processing application, but the Quattro Pro application is also captioned as "Home Edition" so it may be missing some features available in the Quattro Pro included in other Suite versions (Standard, Pro, Student/Teacher, etc.).  The Home Edition may still be suitable for some users, but I'm a strong believer in "full disclosure."  WordPerfect itself is a great program.  Try setting point sizes with decimals in Word -- you can't.  Try changing the size of the font in legal pleadings in Word -- there's no direct control of it (the Microsoft site instructs you to change margins and number of lines per page to attempt to get Word to adjust the font size) [but remember, you need any WordPerfect version other than Home Edition to get Legal Tools]

It helped us pick everything from furniture location to color of carpet and flooring. My favorite feature was the Home Estimator feature that tracked our materials useage

I have purchased both the Home & Gardens interior and the Punch interior software. Home & Gardens is much easier to use. You can really start without reading much of the manual. Punch demands that you read the manual (342 pages). It is not intuative. But Punch can do so much more and has so much more creativity. IE: Punch has a library of trees, shrubs and flowers for your yard. Home & Gardens only have potted plants, nothing you can use to landscape. Punch also allows you to make custom doors or windows to your exact specifications. H&G doesn't. You have to choose a set style of door or window and change options.I also could place digital photos of my backyard behind my "house" on Punch to make it more realisitic. I like both software programs, but Punch has more options, but you have to do your homework first

Looked at them all and then bought this software... it can do a lot of things so, yes, it might take a bit to learn and get fast with. 

There is a reason it has been voted best for several years now. It does a good job if you remember the very old computer saying,
"Garbage IN...Garbage OUT" 8-)  

My wife loves the video tutorials that she can pop-up anytime she needs to without stopping the software and what she's working on.

Anything this complete, is worth the learning curve

I recently  purchased this software to redesign my bathroom and bedroom.  Compared to other products that I have evaluated, Punch! Interior Design Suite wins hands-down in the areas of versatility, stability, and 3D.  It includes many precision, dimension, and viewing options that allow you to make both simple and complex designs.  Using the split 2D/3D mode also helps with placing components such as windows and doors.  After I completed the drawings I showed them to my builder and he was able to remodel the rooms exactly as I had envisioned them.  Like most software I have used, this package does contains a learning curve.  I by no means consider myself a computer guru and I had to put in a little practice time.  You will find, however, a plethora of resources available both on-line and within the manual/tutorials to assist you with your project

It installed without any problems.  It runs without any problems. I am very happy with it. 

I am a convert from Microsoft Money.  I am self employed and have one employee.  My wife is also self-employed.  We have twenty different financial accounts (investment accounts, retirement accounts, checking accounts, savings accounts, a mortgage, a home equity line of credit and credit cards).  We often pay business expenses with our personal credit card, as the credit card gives us frequent flyer miles for every purchase.  Quicken 2007 Home and Business allows us to do our personal accounting and business accounting all in one program, which makes it much easier.  

The one step update (automatic downloading of our transactions and balances from financial institutions) works with 17 of our 20 accounts.  Downloading data from the other 3 accounts requires some manual steps, but is still fairly painless.

I like the online backup feature. It is inexpensive (you pay a small annual charge) and easy to use.

I am not very impressed with the investment analysis features, although I have not yet fully explored them.  I would like to be able to compute realized and unrealized annualized rates of return for individual positions or groups of positions, and it doesn't seem like I can do that in this program.

I use this program daily and it is awesome!  It has lots of great new features especially the new home page that has the customer, vendor and employee centers where you can now see all of the information in one place.  The features and functionality of the program are everything any small to mid size business needs to run their company from a financial point of view.  Great improvements over previous versions

I believe it is important to say that I am a QuickBooks ProAdvisor. As a technical consultant to small businesses, I began supporting QuickBooks several years ago after I saw how it benefited my clients.

I began useing QuickBooks myself in 1999 for my business. This version is one of the best advances I have seen. The new home page shows the various work-flows in an easy to understand format, making it easy to get to the form I need with one click. I really like the new "Centers" for customers, vendors and employees. Most of the information I need when looking for history with a customer or vendor is available when I click on the customer or vendor name. With one more click I can easily see the original transaction. I used to have to go through several screens to get to the information I needed.

The industry customization in the Premier Edition is a great addition and well worth the additional investment. I have a client using the Contractor Edition. The Contractor Center provides a quick glance at how the business is doing. The Job Cost reporting is an excellent tool to help better manage the business by comparing actual to estimated costs. They have been able to improve their estimates based on the information QuickBooks makes available to them.

The key to having the information you need is to make sure you get it setup properly in the beginning. Spend some time reviewing the excellent on-line training and help before you setup your company files. If you don't like reading the instructions, another option would be to get the help of a local QuickBooks ProAdvisor for assistance.

I highly recommend it.

I have been supporting QuickBooks as a financial and technical consultant for small businesses for over a dozen years.  This year's version added a neat feature that allows you to see all of your customer's invoices, payments, estimates, - all in the same window - just by clicking on a customer in the list.  No more multiple clicks to create customer reports.  It is just plain easy, and the information pops up on your screen immediately. Congratulations to Intuit on a job well done

Building on the Intuitive QuickBooks Pro interface and SQL database, QuickBooks Premier enables firms to scale - merely by clicking on a button and paying the difference. This ensures no work is lost. There is a whole new menu dedicated to specific Industries. While the estimate can have multiple options, when the customer places an order, the Sales Order function enables QuickBooks to saddle up for the ride. It generates Purchase Orders with the click of a button, and when goods are received, keeps track of who it is for. Invoices are generated from the sales order as well, and partial invoicing keeps track so I don't leave money on the table. I use the email function all the time, sending pdf attachments and cc:g myself so there's a time stamp. 

To address the problem of sharing large files, there is a new Portable Company File (much like a Zip file) which compresses files for emailing. 
I have also grown to appreciate the online banking auto-reconciliation function - I log in to the bank every morning, and watch as transactions appear and then get matched with my books, leaving me only unreconciled transactions. 

QuickBooks also enables integration with third party software - there is a legion of industry specific solutions that help with core business operations. With 2006, QuickBooks has moved from being a software to a Business Operations System

I am a solo family medicine physician and have been using the Quickbooks Pro series since 2003.  At first, I was a little upset with being forced to upgrade my QB Pro 2003, however once I installed the new Premium 2006, I must say I am very pleased.

From the beginning, everything has changed just a small bit, however in a very good way.  In my past version of QB Pro 2003, I had to toggle between different screens in order to move from deposits to writing checks, etc.  In Premium 2006 this is no longer the case.  A very easy to use and intuitive home page shows everything you need to use.  Each different tool is one simple click away.  I very much like the new enhanced payroll option in that I can now print out my state tax forms along with my federal forms.  In the past, it would take an hour or two out of my family time in order to fill in those little boxes and double check each figure with my CPA.  Now I print out each form and am finished in less than 10 minutes.

I would highly recommend this product to any solo or small group practice.  The versatility and power found in Quickbooks Premium allows me to keep track of my finances personally.  The added convenience of the payroll services just makes this product an even better buy.  Yes, there are enough subtle differences between the Pro and Premium version to justify spending a few extra dollars.  I would definitely buy this software title again

For years I used PowerQuest's Drive Image 7 for backups. It's rock solid and totally dependable. When Symantec aquired PowerQuest they rolled the underlying technology of Drive Image 7 into Norton Ghost. The result is a very capable and reliable package that can backup partitions or entire drives and also provides support for incremental backups. Most importantly, like Drive Image 7, it provides for emergency recovery of your system. Just boot from the Ghost CD and restore the backup (restore point) that you select. I've tested this process by making both full system backups and subsequent incremental backups, and then restoring the system from those backups. The process works flawlessly. If you need to restore to a different physical drive (replaced a failed drive, etc), the process requires a few extra selections, but is still very straightforward. Just take the time to read the manual.

I've seen Acronis True Image recommended by some both here and elsewhere. I've tried Acronis and find it lacking in one major respect: It simply is not reliable. During trials, I made backups with Acronis. Acronis indicated that the backups were successful but, when attempting to make a system recovery just minutes later, Acronis indicated that the backups were corrupted and could not be used. The backups were worthless.

When purchasing backup software remember that bells and whistles don't count for anything. The only thing that counts is reliability. It must be able to reliably restore your system. Norton Ghost passes that test with flying colors.

Challenging and fun. Graphics a fair compared to the mindless flashy video games. Educational value is exellent, challenging and helps develop speed as well as accuracy. The challenge of having to think and get the right math answer in order to advance makes the games more challenging than the flashey graphic video games. If the animation was similar to the flashy video game adventures ( IE: Jak 3 or Ratchett and clank)it might make it too hard because of all the distractions and tools obtained. It might be interesting if that level of graphics and animation was worked into the game. The younger kids may be better able to intergrate a multi-tooled, multi-level, multi-directional with more mapping and varied spatial orientation than older people. My eight year old was able to gain more speed quicker on the game than I was

I have every single (that I know of) Math Blaster game out there. My kids love them all. I saw this one and couldn't resist buying it. My 12, 10, and 7 year-olds all play this version. (It's too simple for the 12 year old, but he plays as a reward for piano practice - so I'm not too concerned about his refreshing earlier math skills.) My thought it to have each child play the grade level above theirs, and that's ususally right where they're at. Yes, there are a few annoying glitches in the way some of the characters can and cannot move around (I don't play them myself to know well) but I would hope that children are not so whiny that it matters too much. I think every family should have Math Blaster Geometry, Algebra, and all grade levels. If you can make math fun, and use it as a POSITIVE REWARD...that is called a "win win"! :

I have tried other systems before and they took the "long way around" about getting to the Rock and Roll stuff I wanted. This one however jumps straight into what I wanted to know about ROCK guitar. The teaching method is fantastic. The program shows not only where notes would fall but includes a "virtual fret board" so I can see exactly what to play. This feature includes a "slow" version to start with then a normal speed version that (in almost every case) is exactly like the song being heard. I have played guitar (that is fooled with guitar) for about twenty years this program got me playing and learning every day for a couple hours. Now I have much more fun jamming and playing songs I have heard. I recommend this for anyone beginners to intermediate

I have been taking acustic guitar lessons for 6 years now. I decided to buy this to try and learn to play the electric guitar I recieved as a gift. It's a pretty good method. Sometimes a bit difficult to work with, but you do learn some things. I stopped using it because it became increasingly difficult to play when I realized that I had a bass amp. So make sure you have all the right equipment, and I would have to say that this might be easier for someone who's taken guitar lessons.

I picked this up for my twelve year old son.  He is a beginner and has been glued to his electric guitar and eMedia Rock Guitar Method for the last two weeks.  The program is a great starter, just in case the kids don't stick with it.   It's better than $45 bucks an hour once a week, for now, at least.    

Great Product!  I reccomend it

I thought this was a great product.  It's like having your own guitar instructor, but even better.  You only have to pay once and you get hours of instructions you can use for as long as you want.  Also, you can use it any time you want without having to make a trip.  I'm pleased with my purchase.  You will be too

Though I've odered many times with Amazon, this is the first time I have been excited enough to review a product!  I'm an adult who wants to learn guitar for fun and didn't want to play "Mary had a little lamb" and scales for months.  I have only used the software for about an hour, and have already been playing parts of songs I actually like!  I have been playing guitar for a total of one week prior to receiving this (without any instruction).This is perfect if you don't have the patience or desire to learn the traditional way.  I wish I had this when I was 14, I would have loved it.

I can't vouch for the whole thing yet, since I've only played with it for an hour, so I give it 4 stars instead of five.  From what I've seen I have no reason to expect that it will let me down and highly recommend it

This is a good computer Bible, but for the money, I prefer a program like AMG Bible Essentials which has the Libronix Library System built-in and can be integrated with other Bible study software.  For about $15 more the AMG program has both KJV, Apocrypha and NASB, including a lot of other capability, like Greek translations, word study, exegesis, parallel Bible comparisons, etc.  The Rainbow Bible is an older issue and shows its age by not offering features as mentioned above.  Some benefits of this Bible include both NIV and KJV translations, color maps, Matthew Henry's commentary, Naves and a version of Foxe's Book of Martyrs. The various colors can be distracting at times, but overall it is worth considering, particularly if you like the NIV

I wanted this Bible for Mother's Day after I did not get it I ordered it on June 25 and got it rather quickly.  Enough said about the wonderful shipping time with Amazon Prime.

I normally do not like Bibles that do not have the words of Christ in red but this Bible is sensational.  I love it!!!! I like the way it gives an overview of each book of the Bible.  The colorful maps and illustrations make this Bible beautiful.  At the end of the Bible there are 365 memory verses to be learned each day.  So not only is studying emphasized but learning scriptures is also emphasized.

This Bible is wonderful for individuals who are new to reading the Bible.  I would highly recommend geting this Bible as a gift for a new convert or seasoned veteran in the Gospel who is interested in in depth study.  Reading this Bible is fun.

ISBN-1581700296 Black Leather Non-Indexed KJV

This is a beautiful bible. Every verse is colored and each color stands for something such as Love, Family, Faith, Salvation, etc. It also has the center column reference, a one year bible reading schedule, a daily verse lisiting with, of course, 365 verses, one for each day of the year, various maps and pictures, outlines of each book, and a list of 100 popular bible verses, 50 from the old testament and 50 from the new. There is also a section in the front of the book that explains the color system and gives examples as well. It is also available in NIV as well as KJV. 

I'd highly suggest this bible to anyone, but shop around. The one I bought listed at amazon for $77.99 but I bought it at a local bookstore for $39.99 plus tax. Same book, same ISBN exactly.

Simply superb programme and the standard by which other image manipulation software is judged allbeit with some disparagement. The advancements made from my first PS 3 through to PS 6 and now CS and CS2 has been truly remarkable. However think I will sit out CS 3 and catch up

Photoshop CS 2 Screen The Current Adobe Photoshop CS 2 Line

    * The Adobe Bridge: The next generation of the Photoshop File Browser. This allows you to organize, browser and locate photos, images and movies across shared Adobe Creative Suite applications.

      Since The Bridge is a standalone application, you can launch it separately or access it by double clicking on Adobe Photoshop CS 2 in the dock.

    * New Camera Raw gives you control over your digital negatives in Adobe Photoshop CS 2. It is much easier to work on a several images at the same time. The Camera Raw has Auto checkbooks for Exposure, Shadows, Brightness and Contrast sliders.

    * The Vanishing Point lets you clone, paint and transform images. Image Warping allows you to fold, stretch, pull, twist and wrap an image into shape by selecting an on-demand preset or dragging custom control points.

    * Photoshop CS2's Smart Objects allow you to scale and transform images and vector illustrations without losing image quality, and

    * Smart Guides appear when you're moving text or objects around, making it easier to align them.

Working within the 'Inner Core' of Adobe Photoshop CS 2

Most of my Photoshop CS work is done in the Browser. I single-click the photos that I need for my Photoshop CS project. Now I have a group of highlighted photos that can be used in the Browser's Automated menu.

The inner core of the Photoshop CS Browser's Automated menu contains: Batch, PDF Presentation, Contact Sheet II and Online Services. Also, Automated menu contains Photomerge, Picture Package and Web Photo Gallery.

Running these automated menu tasks from the File Browser saves me a lot of time. I can avoid opening each photo file separately in Photoshop CS.

The Photoshop CS 2 Browser has Sort capabilities that contains the Filename, Flag, Rank, Width and Height. Also, Sort capabilities that contains File Size, Resolution, File Type and Color Profile.

The Photoshop Browser's Sort contains Date Created, Date Modified, Copyright and Custom. You can sort them in ascending or descending order.

Photoshop CS Photomerge and PDF Presentations

In Photomerge, I can make a collage of photos and move them in any order. Also, I can take several sections photos of a large bridge using a tripod. I then take the section photos and join them together with Photoshop CS' Photomerge. I still have to edit the new Photomerge photo for length, size and contrast.

In PDF Presentation, I can turn my photos into Acrobat PDFs and stitch them together. The fun is turning my new creation into a slideshow with various transitions. The PDF Presentation is cross-platform that can be used on a Mac and Windows computers.

Working with the 'Outer Core' of Adobe Photoshop CS 2

Keyboard Commands

The one-key letter shortcuts that I use quite often is M for Marquee, V for Moving objects, T for Text, I for Eyedropper and C for Crop. There is a multitude of Toolbox one-key letter shortcuts that you can use or change.

Toolbox uses the Shift bar to get to related tools on the same pop-out menu. For example, to cycle through the Lasso, Polygonal Lasso, and Magnetic Lasso tools, hold down Shift bar and keep pressing "L" key.

Change Keyboard Commands in Photoshop CS 2

This means that missing Photoshop CS Menu keyboard commands can now be added. For example, I am constantly making changes to my images by changing the photos' contrast and brightness.

Now without using the computer mouse, I use the Command, Control, and C keys in unison. Like a piano chord, I can now change the contrast and brightness in my digital photographs.

I use Command, Control, and letter keys for adding keyboard commands. This works well within the menus and plugin filters that I use in Photoshop CS.

Pro Reaction

Photoshop CS offers flexibility and nondestructive editing. Photoshop's Welcome screen and improved Help ease the learning curve for new users. The Help menu is changeable. I find Photoshop CS' Help menu an excellent way to learn the various functions of Photoshop program. Photoshop CS comes with a paper, hardcopy paper manual. Photoshop CS 2 works best within Mac OS X 10.4 Macs including Intel Macs. 

Con Reaction

You have to read and work with hardcopy paper manual. The Bridge does not work in older Photoshop programs. 

Final Words

Photoshop remains the industry standard for professional photo editing, graphic design, and digital imaging. Adobe Photoshop is considered the industry standard. Photoshop skills are required for employment in the graphic design field.

Digital photographers will benefit from Adobe Photoshop with its strong digital-camera raw workflow.

Photoshop CS 2 is in a league of it's own. It can be used to do professional photo retouching and correcting but it is also probably the best painting package out there. It's not perfect however. There are some features that high end compositing and color grading programs like Inferno and DaVinci have that Photoshop could use, and the warper is just bare bones but then we're talking big bucks and no doubt Photoshop will eventually have something like them. Except for a few filters, it can function in 16 bits per channel which was a long time coming but now it's here, making it a professional product. Still, as far as I'm concerned, the ultimate paint program has yet to be written

I was very pleased to discover all of the data packed into this program.  Setting up the query parameters is easy & the amount of info concerning places of interest (services, banks, transportation) is substantial.  About the only drawback I found was the quality of the help contents, which was not very user friendly.  Most of the time I was unable to find solutions to my question/problem because the data was way too complicated (displaying data in technical equations) or was not listed at all.  However, calls to technical support usually resolved the questions.  Finally, I was disappointed that the program does not allow you to print written legends off to the side on your map (ie: a listing of addresses for your push pin locations).  Other than that, the program is very handy, loaded with tons of great data & the quality of the maps is superior.

Absolutely love this program. I'd been using Norton for years and so was initially hesitant to switch. Its not as user friendly as Norton and has the annoying habit of repeatedly asking for permission even after it has been granted. On the upside this feature adds to its efficiency and gives the user complete control over all internet activity, making it an exceptionally good security program.

Good product Amazon had a great price.  Even though people say it is high priced I paid $44 after discounts.  I tried the Beta version and I liked it.  Beta version does not give you all of the features but enough to get the idea.  Easy to install worked at the get go.  Intuitive enough to figure it out.  You may have to go through things a few times to understand what it means.   Didn't have a manual with the Beta version and still figured it out. Manual does provide information, works great.  Didn't need any help. Had Mcafee before didn't find any new virus. It works as good as Mcafee but it is a lot faster when you start up.  Both Kaspersky and Mcafee have features I like.

I've been using this for several years without ever having a problem. I like this new version even better than the last version by having everything in one control panel makes it easier than before. It uses less system resources than Norton plus I know people that have gotten viruses using Norton & McAfee. Kaspersky always rates in the top three. The only drawback is there is no anti spyware but I don't feel that is an issue. Let them worry about viruses & such & I'll continue using Webroot's Spysweeper to control spyware. Together, they make a great combo to keep my computer clean

I have used MS WORKS from about the time it was born, when it was quite primitive and sometimes unstable. But I have continued to use it, primarily for databases, because it has become progressively more stable and easy to use.  These are not all small and simple databases--many include several thousand items, each with 20 to 30 fields of data.  It is easy to &quot;find&quot; single items or to assemble groups of items (&quot;filter&quot;), and to print customized reports.  So if you don't need (or want) the super sophistication of ACCESS, I have found WORKS to be a friendly and helpful--and inexpensive--alternative

I put MS Works on all systems that I make for other people. It has everything they need, and it dosen't break the bank. The only thing I don't like is that there is no Presentation software, or PowerPoint clone. Then again, if they included that, MS Office sales would go down A LOT!!

I've been working with Punch AS/4000 since v10.0 was released (about 12 months ago). Although I agree in many respects with the positive reviews. For example, there are is a large feature list. However, there are issues with the software. For example: 

- Hard coded limitations in the software design (e.g. four possible scale options for printing, does not support Grid Snap smaller than 3/8" or 10mm - which seriously complicates moving things around on a drawing with any degree of precision, very tiny dimension text on Windows, etc.)
- Inaccuracies: I printed a 1:100 scale drawing that came out at 1:94 approximately;
- I couldn't fit a scale house drawing on 8.5 X 11 paper, no print preview;
- There are limitations and inconsistencies with dimensions (i.e. placement, snap to geometry, etc.)
- The PowerTools seem to be a series of independently developed add on modules that don't necessarily conform with the application interface (e.g. precision, look and feel, functionality)
- The elevation editor is very limited. It basically provides a visual representation of the drawing with some editing and texture applications
- Can't differentiate exterior wall treatments independently from the wall surface (e.g. brick and siding on the same floor).
- Object library is very limited for plumbing fixtures, furniture, windows, etc. Common items aren't in the library nor are they easy to find. (You can create them yourself though).
- The 3D object editor is ok but not terribly intuitive.
- Multi-floor buildings get complicated to work with once you add floors or ceilings.
- Once you add objects, drawings get big and slow very quickly.
- Import/Export is limited

In short AS/4000 could use an overhaul, an updated object library, a major upgrade to scale and printing and an overall clean-up to create a more integrated and functional product. Also, incorporate user feedback into future releases

This is really good software.  I own CAD software, but it doesn't do what Punch Home Design can do.  It has a bit of a learning curve, but if you take the "step by step" tutorials, you'll find it much easier to learn.  I did a module of the tutorial (there are several), then I saved that drawing as "test" and loaded my own and did the appropriate things to it.  By going back and forth, I got to use the steps being taught several times which made it easier to remember "how" to do that thing.  If you're planning to remodel (that's what I'm doing) or building from scratch, this software will give you a real good idea of what your completed remodel or construction will be like.  It will more than pay for itself by saving you from making a costly mistake

After using this software for a week, I'm generally pleased with the results. The learning curve is not too difficult to climb; though I have some prior experience with less sophisticated versions of this type of software.

The box comes with a thick printed manual, which is nice to have for reference. The index in the manual is good but not great. Unfortunately the manual is not comprehensive. It appears to cover the core functionality but does not have any depth to its discussion of "power tools". The manual appears to be a nearly verbatim copy of the online help.

The software comes with short online instructional videos -- basically animated screen captures with voice-over commentary. The two or three videos that I've watched have filled in the gaps that the manual left open.

My pc has a 2001-era 1Ghz Celeron and 1GB of memory. It renders the 3D drawings fast enough to not be frustrating, and I have limited patience for this sort of thing. However, I have not added great amounts of detail to the plan yet -- mostly just walls, roof, electrical, and some trim. The addition of detail may slow rendering down enough to be annoying. Other reviewers have complained about performance, but the documentation has hints for speeding up if you run into problems.

While the core parts of the software are pretty good, the power tools leave a little something to be desired. This may just be a lack of education on my part, but if so then I'm going to blame the skimpy documentation. These power tools almost appear to have been developed by either different groups or by third parties. Overall they lack the polish and usability that is part of the core software. Take the "room wizard", for example. This is a slick way to put together the interior floor plan of the house. The problem is that the room wizard launches almost as a separate application, and when you're done it asks to "update the current design". When you say yes, it appears to paste the picture drawn in the room wizard back into the main application. From there, it is difficult (impossible?) to get the interior layout to overlay your foundation design.

I had difficulty with other power tools: the topo designer is clunky, the site planner has an annoying lot size limitation (no line can be more than 1000'), the estimator won't let you add additional materials (you can put in the cost of concrete for your foundation, but you can't add fill or stone for drainage; if I have to manually put this stuff into a separate spreadsheet then having a built-in estimator is pointless). And so on. Again, maybe this is a learning thing, but the rest of the software is easy to figure out -- why are these so different?

Overall, I would give the software 3.5 stars: four stars for doing the stuff it absolutely must do very well, minus one star for advertising extras that don't work so good, plus a star for good documentation on the core functionality, minus half a star for failing to document the extras. (I figure that the extra thirty to fifty bucks of cost over competing brands is due to these extras, but I haven't tried the competition.

If you are even remotely familiar with home design or CAD software then this is your product assuming you can't deal with the price or steep learning curve of Chief Architect Base v10 (~$1300).  Chief Architect (CA) is the Holy Grail of powerful yet intuitive home design software but it's not cheap and it's not for beginners; it is really aimed at pro's not home enthusiasts.  Most home enthusiasts would be far better off with Punch! AS4000.  But if you have a brain, some patience, and like a challenge and want the best, go with CA.

Punch! AS4000 v10 is the *best* product on the market in the sub-$1000 price point *easily* beating out products like CadSoft Envisioneer @ $795 (4x the cost!).  In my opinion CadSoft Envisioneer has no market.  If you are going to spend $800 on "Pro" software, get Chief Architect for $500 more.  If you don't need that much power that CA has (ie you aren't an engineer or architect drawing formal construction blueprints), than buy Punch! AS4000 for $500 less than Envisioneer.  Envisioneer is a product priced in no-mans land.  It's a suckers buy.

Back to the product at hand.  First, Punch! AS4000 isn't as easy to pick up for a neophyte (ie complete computer design newbie) as say 3D Home Architect or Better Homes & Gardens (both of which were spawned from the same 3DHA v4 code base).  But, it is much more fully featured, faster and much more powerful and less buggy.  It's UI is more standard and intuitive to Windows software guru's, and it's 3D renderer blows away the competition not only in speed but quality.  It renders stunning 3D scenes which blow away the competition visually at 1/4 to 1/3 the time!

Plus, Punch! recently (and quietly) acquired 3DHA from Riverdeep / Encore to supplement thier "bottom-end sub-$40 market".  In other words, Punch! considers 3DHA to be the bottom-feeder and not real competition against thier product for which they are 100% correct.  3DHA and it's derivatives are junk compared to Punch!; every few years I review them all and Punch! has been on top for a while.  Not just in features.  Not just in speed.  Not just in reliability / stability.  But across the board.  

TopTenReviews recently gave Punch! the #1 spot, as they deserve.  Punch! has also been the top selling home enthusiast design software for the last 6 years running.  It's not by accident.  It's because it is the best; hands down.

3DHA users should seriously consider jumping ship to Punch! now that they own it.  The only reason to consider 3DHA over Punch! is if you are a total clueless newbie.  Once you are no longer a totally clueless newbie, it's time to move to a serious program like Punch!  Even if you have a lot of 3DHA content, it doesn't mean you shouldn't start moving over to Punch!  You can continue to use both until Punch! has a solid 3DHA importer.

This recent acquisition means that Punch! owns 75%+ of the home design software market for home enthusiasts.  This is estimated to be a $50 million market and Punch! pretty much has it owned.  Since Punch! considers 3DHA to be the bottom-feeder, don't count on the 3DHA title or code base to be drastically improved in the future.  In fact, if I had to gues I would bet that over time the existing 3DHA code base will be scrapped by Punch! and replaced with it's own code base w/ some of the power tools stripped.

In short:

1) if you are a professional who knows their way around CAD and want the best for home design despite the cost, get Chief Architect v10 Base ($1300) or Full ($2k+).  It's learning curve is steep but nothing beats it.

2) if you are a home enthusiast who has a clue around CAD or home design software, then this (Punch! AS 4000) is your choice.  End of story.  Buy it.

3) if you are a complete newbie and have never used home design or CAD software before, I recommend buying the cheapest v6 or v7 3DHA Special Edition you can find here on Amazon for only $9.99!!!  It's very limited but will serve it's purpose.  Go through the tutorials.  Learn how to use it.  Play with it until you know what is going on.  Design something simple.   This way it costs you only $10 to leverage all of the tuts included in 3DHA and come up to speed with the terminology and concept of home design.  Then toss it and buy Punch! AS 4000 v10 to do your real work. 

It takes a real program to do real work. ;-P

It is the coolest game about horses. It teaches the most important basic about caring for horses and riding horses. It is a bit confusing at the beginning and a little help from Mom or Dad should be welcome, even though my daughter found things that I did not, it's a team effort at the beginning. After that it's just very pleasurable, and can go on for ever. According to my daughter it is very addictive (!!) and she has already Dreamer and Lets ride. OK it's not high visual 3D as the others, but let's face it, a lot more entertaining.
In all it is a real cool game, and worth the 5 stars. Perfect gift, and good for Mom and Dad also...

I bought this and I think it is a very good game but, I can not really continue the game because I lose money trying to get some by doing the 5 things. I am going to keep on trying to finish the game. If you are really good at solving games and love horse I would get this game. And anyone can try it and if you keep on trying it you can win the game

At first I didnt like this game because of the graphics but once I learned how to play I really thought it was fun one time I was so interested that I woke up at 8:00am and played the whole game to 11:00pm
If you are a horse lover and know some amount about horses you will love this game if you do NOT like horses you might still like it but I dont know because I am a major horse lover so here are some things in the game-

-feed and groom your horse every day.

-keep practicing your riding skills you could make it to the championships

-they will giveyou tasks to do for instance "breed a horse".

- you can go to the breeders office to breed a horse or you can own a stallion and a mare and buy the breeding pasture and breed them yourselves

          If you buy this item I hope you have fun with it and hope my review was helpful to you.

Every once in a while you come across a product that does just what you wanted it to.  The Snapstream remote is one of them.

I just recently built a home theater pc through which I play music and movies. However, the HTPC is in a different room than my projector and I needed a way to operate the pc remotely while in the theater room.  I chose the Snapstream remote for this function and have been well pleased.

I also highly recommend the Snapstream remote for those people using or looking to use the Beyond TV PVR solution.  I record all my favorite TV programs on my HTPC in high-def and able to access them with a single click of a button via the Snapstream remote.

This is one product that I can recommend with no reservations

This remote works really well and it's easy to create your own profiles for whatever application you use, or to customize it however you want.  There is a good user community that is doing a lot of cool things with the Firefly.  Set up is simple and the range is good.  It "just works."  

The only suggestion is that the buttons are not backlit so it's hard to use in the dark.  Adding to that problem is that the remote is pretty much symmetrical so you can be holding it upside down and not really realize it.  If it weren't for that I'd give it five stars, and if they came out with a version that had backlit buttons I wouldn't hesitate to upgrade

I've used the ATI all-in-wonder remote with a make-shift media center solution before and it's been sluggish, and sometimes non-responsive.  Not so for the FireFly.  Quick, responsive and adaptive. 

I also tried the CyberLink media remote.  Not even suitable to prop-up a bird-food tray.  You'll find Cyberlink's tech support is positively absurd.  Their primary focus is to ask you tons of questions till you run out of patience, or till they find an excuse to tell you they can't help you.

The firefly really rocks.  Controls several programs and tools and even provides a mouse interface incase you can't get things just right with the application and pre-defined buttons.  

If you have a PC and want media-center performance on it - I'd recommend this guy.

Sadly the data is RF for this remote; not IR.  I was hoping to 'absorb' all the functions of this remote into my Harmony 688 but they don't talk the same.  I think SnapStream offers another product to talk IR for the same purposes, but I'm not there yet.  Still getting my sea-legs with the Firefly's abilities.

I've had this PC remove for 1 year and I have used it everyday that I am home and I have not yet changed the remote batteries.  My PC has suddenly become more entertaining and useful.  With this remote, the time I spend sitting in front of the monitor is reduced.

In my 860 sq ft APT, the farthest point away from my pc is about 50 ft.  The remote has always worked from anywhere in the APT thru 2 walls. I was surprised to get this much range. I have not yet found a spot from which it doesn't work.  To get the best range BE SURE to position the USB RF receiver near the computer as directed.

With my PC, I'm always playing music.  I also play digital video files that were either taken with my camera or were rented digitally from the Internet.  I have a good graphics card with S-Video TV out.  I got a 50 ft S-Video/Out cable; this connects my PC and TV which are in different rooms.  

With this remote, I now can play (and control) my entire digital music collection on my home stereo (which is connected to the TV) without being at my PC or be in the same room as my PC.  Also, with this remote, any video that can be played on my PC, (online streaming or local) I can watch and control it (pause, rewind, slow motion, next, FWD) on my TV.  

My PC/TV has effectively become a powerful media center--Media center PC not needed.   

There is so much more...  with the remote, I use the mouse from far away (lying in bed or on the couch); there a numerous ways to get creative with this.

I wish the remote was lighted. Still, the keys are arranged for "touch typing" so to speak.  Another negative, I've noticed that Windows Media Player sometimes crashes when video is launched from within the software that comes with the remote.

I purchased this Firefly remote a month ago to work with my PC-PVR (I have got a Hauppauge PVR-250 card and BeyondTV 3).  As my computer and TV set are in different rooms, I thought it would be convenient to have an RF remote control so that I can still control video recording/playback while sitting in front of my TV. RF signals can usually travel a longer distance, and most importantly, they can penetrate walls.

However, my first installation with the Firefly remote was not a totally success.  It functioned well, but I have only measured a 6-foot of workable distance - with full battery power, and no blocking objects or interference sources nearby.  I thought either I had a defective item, or the product was not as good as they said.

I contacted Snapstream for support, and they suggested to try a different USB port or use a powered USB hub for plugging receiver.  My computer has 6 USB ports - 4 in back and 2 in front, all built on the motherboard.  I was using a front USB for the measurement.  After I switched to an USB port in back, everything becomes perfect.  I have learned that even all being built on the same motherboard, USB ports can be different, which may provide different power levels for external devices.

Now my Firefly works great for my application, which is about 13 feet of transmission distance and with a wall (and some blocking objects as well) inbetween.  Firefly remote can even perform the job of a mouse.  Although it may not be as fast and convenient as a real mouse, it comes in handy for quick-and-easy controls. For the convenience the Firefly remote brings, I give it 5 stars!

Finally some good compression for scanned text/image

I bought this package because I wanted good, high-compression universally accessible documents and images for my personal web page. (Google Werbos).
Finally, after zillions of googles on compression technology and trying many other things (see my other reviews), I found something that really, really works well, in a highly flexible and controllable way! What a relief! Much better than Acrobat 6.0, and other packages I have tried and reviewed. 
    The key capability lies in the "save as" command, which includes "optimized pdf" as one of the file types. The "settings" there gives you the power to choose JBIG2 and JPEG2000 compression, the very best formats for black and white or color scanned images or papers. And of course, as pdf, they are easy for anyone to read. 
   An example: two weeks ago, the world's top empirical nuclear physicist, in Japan, sent me a set of 24 1-meg JPEGs for a 24-page paper. Nothing I had would read it, except Microsoft Digital Image, which let me fix the pages and crop them; in Adobe 6.0, they ended up being a readable 14 meg document. No better. I printed it out at work, and scanned in the result at 400 dpi to a good modern copier/scanner. It ended up 5 megabytes. (The copier was modern and "intelligent".) Then, at home, in Adobe 6, it would
optimize it to pdf version 6, a nice 2.6 megabyte file. Today, I got it
to 940 K (and better quality, to the eye)in Acrobat 8.0, in a controllable
predictable way. I had previously tried many, many other options (including lots of Microsoft programs, all options).
    If I understand what I have seen... I could have used Acrobat 8.0 DIRECTLY, without all that printout and scan nonsense! The direct control in the "save as" command gets rid of the need to do all that. What's more,
I just reduced a 3.5 meg file (from the best previous material) to 1.02 megs. (As best I recall, I used CVISION before and only got that file to 1.5-2 megs. Acrobat 8.0 seems to be doing much better.)
    If you google a lot on compression and comparisons, you will see some small advantage of CVISION over older versions of Adobe Image Capture and Acrobat. But that's misleading. In Acrobat 6.0, I couldn't GET to that better compression. (Maybe if I had a PhD in Adobe, I could, but I tried hard..). With 8.0, it was easy. And the results are better than CVISION now, so far as I can tell. I certainly see no value at all in the new XPS formats Microsoft is touting, with Vista, now that something so much better is available.
    One caveat: published benchmarks say that the DjVu format may be better yet. I did not consider it, partly because of cost, but more because everyone knows how to get the latest pdf reader but DjVu might stop people going to my web page. But if Google Books popularizes it, I might reconsider DjVu. But then again... knowing what lies behind DjVu.. we might figure out something even better... eventually...  and maybe the future pdf standards will open to that!

Installed on Windows XP with no problem and have already done an e-file before the "mid-Feburary" update mentioned by others.  No problems with either.  Having used TurboTax for 6+ years, I had been led to believe that TaxCut was inferior to TurboTax.  I was pleased to discover that TaxCut is just as good as TurboTax and it's cheaper too!  It also includes a rebate for a free Federal e-file, something that Intuit quietly has removed from this year's TurboTax.  I plan to use TaxCut from now on

I think the rosetta stone software is a pretty effective mode of learning. However, it is necessary to do it on a regular basis and would probably be even more effective if one were to study verbs and vocabulary outside of the program. In order to get the most out of the program I feel it is essential to do all the portions of each level/lesson.

So I did the unthinkable. I put Windows Vista Business on my Mac--specifically my Mac Mini. it works great, no system slow downs and no crashes. The Mac handles Vista beautifully. I had no problems using Boot Camp 1.2 in order to install it. The Mac Drivers for Vista (included with Boot Camp) all worked fine. The Vista installation took all of about 30 minutes including some updates and such. I had Windows XP home on my mac b4 and while it worked well , Vista Business works much more smoothly.  

As you may or may not know a Mac Mini is not exactly a powerhouse computer. I have a 1.66 gigahertz Core Duo with 1gb of Ram on it. It displays the Aero interface perfectly especially hooked up to my 32 inch Widescreen LCD TV. Seems even the lowest cost Mac can still make Vista shine while most PCs cant. One disclaimer tho. All intel macs can run Vista Ultimate without a hitch except the Mac Mini (which can only go up to Business/Home Premium)

While Vista is still behind OS X 10.4 (Tiger) its a much better release from XP. Now im just waiting to upgrade my little Mac Mini in October for the release of OS X 10.5 (Leopard)

The software is better than the previous Family Tree Deluxe version I bought.  It allows you to better classify potential matches and decide whether to look at them later or tag them if not interested. The merging process of two databases is easier and allows you to pick what info to merge or whether to keep some info as secondary

I fell in love with another genealogy software years ago and was not happy with any newer ones when support and updates stopped for my original version.  When Ancestry updated this year I decided I had to try a new software package again that was compatible with the cool things you can now do on Ancestry so purchased this version.  I was very pleasantly surprised and happy.  I am still learning the best way to do things and occsionally get frustrated correcting info I have entered incorrectly but I would certainly recommend it.  The online checking it does and ability to attach the records found online is pretty awesome

After many years of the same look and marginal upgrades, Family Tree Maker finally made a serious change to the look and feel of the product. There are still some awkward navigation issues, but overall, I think this is worth a look if you are a long term user and haven't upgraded in a while or are just starting out. 

Having used the available online services that this company offers, I was pleased to find a new feature that integrates some of the online search functionality. Although the integration is a bit superficial, it is useful and made some of my online searches of their databases more productive. I think this is a big step in the right direction and hope they continue to add to the power of this feature as it makes the treasure trove of data they have more accessible.

Too bad they do not make a Mac version, as I prefer this to the Mac products available and so I have to use it with Parallels, which is not so convenient

Though it may lack some of the integrated tools of Quicken or other financial software, MS Money continues to be the best entry level software of its genre and the best value for the money.  Particularly notable is the ease of integrating it with your on-line banking tools to create a one stop shop for your financial needs

I bought this a few months back and have used it quite a bit. The maps look good although i havn't noticed much change from version 2005. There are still some mistakes in the maps and they are still behind on being updated. A little slow to load on both computers but it does fine after it gets going. It has alot of nice features that make it convenient to use. The phonebook is very nice!

I love the new interface and how easy it is to work with documents and apply formatting with such ease.  I have only used it for a month now and I still have to use some of the applications yet.

This edition of the color calibration hardware and software is very professional - a fact that is reflected in the price tag. However, the difference between the uncalibrated and calibrated states on a television is very noticeable.
The kit includes the colorimeter (color measurement device) with a USB connection. The assumption here is that a laptop or nearby desktop is available to calibrate the televisions. The software makes calibration extremely easy. It allows the user to select which color and picture controls the TV allows them to use (not all televisions present the same controls, and even then, they often have different names) and modifies its process accordingly. Calibration takes approximately 30-45 minutes, but the results are undeniably an improvement.
The kit comes in a sturdy plastic case with foam cutouts for the hardware and software (much like a Stargate SG-1 case for an alien device :-) ). While expensive, the software and hardware can be used on nearly anything that displays a picture - TVs of any kind and computer monitors - without limit.
The one caveat is that, for LCD and other TVs or monitors with "delicate" screens, the suction cup provided to stick the colorimeter to the device requires a good deal of force. In fact, the force required is more than I am comfortable with applying to any display I have, except CRTs. As such, calibration requires one to either hold the colorimeter to the TV for each measurement (not really a problem), or buy the tripod for the device. This is the only downside.
This device is definitely of professional quality and is a must for any home theater enthusiast or the perfectionist in your household. It might even be possible to recover the cost of the unit by becoming a calibration technician... :-

I really like OmniForm 5.  Actually I'm using version 5.1 and I'm very satisfied with it.

I was using another forms program I had purchased that was adequate but not nearly as good.  After using FormTool I have a much greater appreciation of OmniForm.

ScanSoft has been on my list of not to buy software recently  because of some of the poor performance of some of their other programs, tech support is expensive from ScanSoft and none of their software that I have used have been easy to learn using the manuals or help files.  In contrast OmniForm was well worth the money.

OmniForm 5 does a great job of either creating forms from scratch, scanning or converting from PDF.  It's the only forms program I have tried so far that actually does a great job of importing a form from a PDF file.

Its has all the tools you need to create a form starting with a blank page.  You can define any field with a variety of formats. Example you can create a date field with a specific format then no matter how the data is input the program will automatically reformat the data the way you specified.  You can create just about any field simply by dragging a symbol from a menu onto the page. In the case of inserting a graphic you can choose to have the graphic saved with the form or not saving with the form itself to conserve file size. You can have the graphic resized by the program with little loss of quality.  Features such as these might be available in other programs of this type but I found OmniForm to do the best job with creating a form field by field with the least effort.

Scanning in of a form is almost flawless.  It even recognized fields on the paper form that were meant to be circled and created the field for them.  Other programs I have used could not do this well if at all.  The only adjustments I had to make on scanned forms were sometimes OmniForm recognized text as bold when it wasn't and occasionally it would change the font. For example it would change Arial to Times New Roman on some spots of the form. Strange quirk.

To get a form imported from a PDF file you have to open the PDF file and print to OmniForm.  This is very accurate with little adjustment necessary after import. OmniForm really shines in this area.  But I did notice if the form your importing from PDF has multiple pages OmniForm will give you an out of memory error when you try to save.  To overcome this flaw you have to import one page at a time, creating a new page each time in OmniForm to make a multi page form from PDF. A little time consuming when you have a 9 page form. 

It will create a self running .exe form you can e-mail and the person on the other end can fill out the form and send it back. This works even the other person does not have OmniForm on their machine.  Because some people filter out .exe file attachments the program also creates a .html version of the form.  This is a very handy feature.

The help file is not of much use. The paper manual is better but still lacking. If you have problems tech support from ScanSoft is expensive.  But there is a user support forum you can get to through the support page on the ScanSoft web site. I have used the forum with great success.

Overall this program is a little difficult to use with some quirks and needed features like being able to import and save a multiple page form from PDF.  But well worth the effort to use as it is the most accurate forms program I have used.

I do recommend this program.  If the flaws I mentioned were corrected I would give this program 5 stars

Excellent product.  The 'over $450 value' might be a bit overstated but the packages is still an excellent value.  During installation, the 1 year free trial to [...] showed up as a 30 day trial but was resolved quickly through familytreemaker.com support and a subsequent call to ancestry.com support.  Ancestry.com provided a 1 year free trial to their US Deluxe product over the phone and didn't ask for a credit card number for renewal.  To me, that's a sign that they're a reputable company.  Some of the additional software in the package is buried on the installation CD but is worth the extra manual effort to find and install - especially the GenSmart software.

I have been using the Family Tree Maker products for a number of years.  I love its ease in the ability to add new people into the genealogy charts.  I am a little disappointed in the change that moved the screen away from looking like a tabbed folder.  I feel that the old style was a lot more user friendly, both visually and functionally

This SW is fantastic.  Having the on-line access made this product perfect, without ionline access this product would only be a storage device for family history that you already know.  I was able to get info on my family back to the 1800's in a matter of days since other relatives did all the research (relatives I don't even know).

If you're reading this. You want to upgrade, your old computer to Windows XP Professional Edition here are a few things to keep in mind. 

First thing is, you can download service pack two from Windows update. So no need to buy it integrated with XP. 

These are what I consider the minimum system requirements: 

256 MB of RAM. I have found is adequate more equals better. 
500 MHz or higher will do. 
7200 rpm hard drive will help a lot. 

If you're running Windows millennium edition, or 98 upgrade now the stability is vastly improved. Gone are the blue screens of death. 

Frequently asked question: is Windows XP Pro better than home edition? 

Windows XP Pro has a more high-end networking features that most home users will never miss or would even know were missing. So for most users Windows home edition is fine. They both are based on the same code and are almost identical. 

If you're thinking of upgrading from Windows 2000, I did, because I like the GUI interface better. But Windows XP is as stable as Windows 2000. So it's your call. 

The plug-and-play ability of Windows XP is totally great! Windows XP will by default find most drivers for video card sound cards, network cards, etc. that is such a bonus gone in the days of having to search for CDs with drivers. 

I recommend upgrading to Windows XP be a professional or home edition. It is a great operating system 

Have some fun and get it done

The product of Windows XP- Professional is just what I was looking for with many updated features and I am looking forward in using it daily.  It was shipped exacting when they had told me to expect it.  But most of all, Service was "top knotch".  I could not have asked to better service on any questions or problems I may have had. Customer service is a plus. I would not hesitate to purchase another product from this seller

First off, for people who are complaining  about installing Windows 2000, it only took my approx. 6 1/2 hours! I love it because every time I launch Internet Explorer it freezes! I also love that theres 42 spyware programs and 78 tojans on my harddrive before I even hooked up my internet. The one thing I love the most though is that I can download any movie I want. Like the recently video game adapted film Mortal Kombat! It was at full quality on my 28.8k modem and it took about 3 minutes. The blue sceen of death happens so often i just went ahead and set it as my desktop and my screensaver. I also bought the separate Ctrl Alt Del accesory pad, ive had it for about 2 days and i cant even tell what key is what anymore because i've used it so much. But all in all DOS has been a blessing, and i hope everyone embraces Windows 95 into their homes.

I think that this is a very good Operating System, but it is FAR TOO OVERPRICED!
A Note to the person who has the issue with disk#4 of his setup disk set:
Try and get access to another computer and run diskcopy, if that does't work, then boot into MS-DOS with a Windows 98SE bootdisk and select the CD-ROM Drive letter and then type "CD I386" then type "winnt" then it will start the installation from the Compact Disc.
I gave it 4 stars because i believe that they could sell a better Operating System for that price

I have been using computers since DOS 5.0 and this is by far the most user friendly, comprehensive, and powerful operating system I have used so far.  Aside from Linux, if you are interested in an easy to use, dynamic OS go with XP professional.  It has lots of features that are always coming in handy.  Unless you wanna go crazy and are an IT Power User (in which case Linux), go with this OS.  Its great

I found this upgrade has fixed some things and attempted to fix things that did not require fixing.  Hot keys that go to dockers does not speed up the work process.  It appears to be slower in handling bmps.  Larger files cause it to hesitate selecting objects.  A real memory hog.  The new contour tool makes the upgrade worthy.  So far it is not crashing like 12 did

CorelDraw was my first foray into vector graphics back when version 3 showed up on my desk at the small "Mom and Pop" screenprinting shop i worked at. Back then, Corel came with OODLES of free fonts, clipart, manuals ... not to mention FREE technical support via a toll-free number.

i stayed with Corel exclusively until version 10 ... enduring countless patches, bugs and the dreaded "odd-numbered" curse (if you tried version 5 or 7, you feel my pain). Adobe Photoshop was always my photo-editing program of choice ... CorelPhotoPAINT just never quite "did it" for me.

Industry demands eventually delegated that i delve into Adobe Illustrator. Being already familiar with Adobe Photoshop's features, tools and "look and feel", Illustrator didn't present a huge, overbearing learning curve. In Illustrator, i found the same robust features as CorelDraw ... which wasn't what impressed me about Illustrator. Adobe's intuitive programs, and their ability to interact with one another ... seamlessly ... THAT is what won me over to Illustrator. Illustrator's ability to edit/create PDF's in their native format? WOW! Exporting LAYERED vector files to Photoshop ... with layers INTACT??? WOW!!! (i could go on)

Now, that being said ... there are STILL things that i prefer in CorelDRAW compared to Illustrator. The EXTRUDE function in corel is MUCH easier to utilize. The PowerClip function is more user friendly than Illustrator's "make clipping mask" function. The ability to customize/edit/add shortcut keys is an amazing feature. (again ... i could go on)

In regards to importing and exporting files from other applications, CorelDRAW wins, hands down. It boasts a ROBUST set of import and export filters, my favorite being the .eps import filter which lets you import an .eps while converting the fonts to curves DURING the import. This is a MUST HAVE if you work with an .eps file created on another computer whose fonts you lack. If i had a dollar for every .eps that pulls into Illustrator with fonts blown out ... i'd be independently wealthy. WHY Illustrator has never implemented this is beyond me.

So, to sum it up ... CorelDRAW is a great program ... but i can't imagine it being my ONLY vector drawing program. Just like in real life, you need a great team. This program, paired with Adobe Creative Suite, meets my needs perfectly.

CorelDraw X3 is a fine product.  It has added some nice features from V-11.  CorelDraw came with a rebate and I must say Amazon failed big time in helping me apply for it...on line was a joke replied by e-mail 3 time never got a reponse...talked to reps 2 times they did not help....yes I got the product in 5 days....but if you have a small problem....Amazon aint gunna get R done

I have been a user since version 4. Version 4 was bad, 5 was good, 6 was terrible, 7 was great, tried 8 & didn't see the point, 9 was stable and very good. I avoided 10. 11 is very good. In Version 12 Corel had added features that made me want to go back to 11. 

So now here we are on X3.  Let me tell you, It has been 5 years since could say I love this program! It loads faster than 11 or 12 (and about a bizillion times faster than Adobe's Illustrator). 

It seems in this version, Corel has really given it's users a good listen because the additions to this program bring draw up to a new level of "I can harldy wait to work on a new project".

 Many of the improvments are simply little things in the way of navigation and shortcuts. Some, like the improved trace work wonderfully and seamlessly. You can go to corel's website to learn of the other improvments. I think you'll be pleased.  

This is a designer's tool that you can purchase and use with confidence.

I've been using System Mechanic 6 Professional, for about a month. I'd have to say that the overall performance of Windows XP has improved greatly since installation. Upon starting System Mechanic, a general report is given on the overall health of Windows. It fixes problems in the registry, defragments the hard-drives/ram, and boosts internet performance. All of this is done is done in a short period of time (under an hour).

I've also read all the negative reviews on Amazon. I'm not going to dispute any of them, since each user has his/her own experiences using the product. All I can say, is that I'm glad that the software worked for me.

You likely won't get the system performance improvement that is advertised unless you had a very "messy" system. But it does have a great antivirus and firewall, and if you like to be able to tweak hidden settings and know a bit more about what is going on "behind the scenes", it's an okay product. But be very careful with the cleanup tool. It will delete some important files if you are not careful!!

I have had my computer for a couple of years now, and I have always wondered if there was ever a product out there to help me rid my computer of WASTE. Well this product was recommended to me by a family member, and I am impressed as to how well it does!! I have never had so much success with one ALL-IN-ONE product as I have the System Mechanic 6 Professional, and the fact that it came with Virus Protection was and added bonus for me too. If your computer is slower than slow I definately recommend that you use this product to get rid of the Unnecessary Junk on your system, and keep up to date with the latest Viruses out there. I don't think I will ever go back to MCCAFEE again!

This book is among seminal works on system safety and safety engineering and should be read by anyone who is entering the field.  One may not necessarily agree with Prof. Leveson's views (e.g. her often unfair and unjustified dismissal of european approaches to safety engineering) but her views in the field are simply too important and influential to be ignored!
The book is a good "bed time reading" that gives an overview of the field, major problems and introduction to some major approaches.  It is however not a handbook per se - you will not understand any particular method sufficiently to apply it.
Overall, very good introductory text with a good coverage and a very easy and clear language

The computer game version of The Number Devil closely follows the book, as kids progress through sections on prime numbers, the Fibonacci series, Pascal's triangle, and an infinite series approaching one.  Nine of the ten games worked well for us, but nobody in the family was ever able to complete the tenth, the arrow game.  We understood the math, but couldn't react quickly enough to shoot down all the arrows.  This was disappointing, because we could never reach the bonus section.  All in all, though, this is a good investment for a child, 8 or up, who loves or wants to understand the mystery of numbers

I purchased Fix-It primarily to correct a registry problem. It was rated very highly on the PCWorld website. It did a great job. I had over 850 registry errors, corrected them and did a reorg on the registry. My computer is running beter now. The other utilities included work as advertised. I have been using Norton Systemworks for many years and this product is very comparable at a lower price

I don't know what other people are complaining about. I just installed Vista Ultimate a few days ago and I absolutely love it. No interface lag or any other lag at all. Maybe the people complaining have weak or outdated hardware. Those people need to turn down their settings if their not going to keep their computers on the cutting edge or at least near it. I'm glad Microsoft isn't waiting for people to catch up and are on the cutting edge. I'd rather be the one catching up than the other way around.

I have a Core 2 Duo e6300 overclocked to 2.5Ghz, 2 gigs of ram, a Geforce 7600gt and a Western Digital Raptor X 150g HD and Vista Ultimate works flawlessly on my computer. It's not the best computer but it runs flawlessly, I built it myself and all the parts cost me about $850 off the net. I play World of Warcraft among some other games and I haven't seen any problems yet with any games or any of the major software I use as of yet. I've only encountered one problem and that was with my old Soundblaster Live! 5.1 sound card which has discontinued support. No big deal, it was about time to get a better one anyway.

I think this is the best version to come out yet. I would have a high end pc if I was to upgrade only software. I would just wait and buy a new pc. Its alot easyer then learning a new operating system and if you enable the adminstrator account and only use your standard accounts to surf the web then it give you some security. The firewall is good in the business versions and there is some good virus software out there. Its got alot more features and run's good's. Device drivers are easyier to load -scott

This software was easy to install.  The Terms and Conditions of Use are very clearly stated.  I found the choice of difficulty levels greatly enhanced the product and challenged me.  The puzzles are fun and the techniques required to play are easily understood. My one wish is that there were more varied games included.... But it is a lot of fun and is definitley challenging..

Maybe it's because I was upgrading from an older version -- 2002 -- but I found the new features to be very good.

For example... the junk mail feature works better than any other I have used.  It was catching junk from the very beginning, and has missed very few things.  I have only had one thing put in the Junk folder that was not junk email.

Also the security features are far superior to the 2002 version.  And the Calendar is more flexible and easier to use.

Installation was seemless.  I think it might be a little overpriced, but considering how long I will keep it, it's not too bad

My four-year-old son loved the first Fritz and Chesster so much I just had to get the second.  I would have gotten the third installment as well, but it appears to require a DVD-Rom and more up-to-date software than he has on his computer (I suggest you always review those details before buying).  Like the first, this second installment has the same quirky and artistic sensibility and lots of amusing details that keep me as interested in it as he is.  

The first one seemed a lot more "British" than this one.  Just one example: in the first installment, the pawns are often depicted as English villagers with low-brow accents.  In this installment they are more often Texas ranchers... There were also numerous Britishisms in the first installment that were tough to understand for a child.  This one is thankfully free of them.  I suppose the American audience proved more lucrative than the original designers had expected.... 

I think the suggested age is more 6-or-above (they really should be able to read, I suppose), but with a little help even a younger child (such as my son) can get into most of the exercises and spend time with it.  There are several more advanced  features in this one than in the first installment.  Here the focus is on basic tactics, openings, and endgame situations.  So a child should really have made it through the first one before getting this.  He absolutely has to know all the rules, for instance -- the second installment is not going to teach them.  The first also has some wonderful exercises with just pawns or kings on the board, for instance, that have much to teach.  And some fun games like a maze with a monster chasing you (to teach the rook moves) or a cannon that fires diagonally (to teach the bishop).  Some of the games here (which resemble early video games, like space invaders) are a little too advanced for a four-year-old's manual dexterity....perhaps for a six-year-old's as well.  But there are many things he can get into nonetheless, especially if you take the time to explain things and get them started.

Overall, I'd say that if you want to give a child an introduction to the game, nothing beats the first Fritz and Chesster.  Other chess teaching video games are much darker and less helpful, really, for beginners.  And if he or she likes the first installment (which is also very girl-friendly), then by all means advance to the second -- especially for kids over 6

I'm not going to cover the technical drawbacks of this software except to briefly mention that you should look over other reviews before you buy.  However, despite annoying design features, this is quite an amazing piece of software!  I would certainly rate it a 5+ if there weren't some design shortcomings and undocumented features ;)

For starters, the educational intent of this software was well thought out.  Young people will certainly learn a lot about chess through using this program and they will have tremendous fun doing it!  The game teaches fairly advanced concepts in very clever and engaging ways for children of all ages and even adults.

The graphics and characters are great.  The explanations of principles are sound and they are reinforced through fun chess exercises.  The program encourages young chess players and at the same time challenges them to improve.

The product description above covers the scope of the concepts covered in detail and I found this description to be accurate so I won't repeat it.  I spent about 2 hours with a 9 year old playing the game and I had a lot of fun!

I didn't find that this program was especially difficult to use and my young friend was able to figure it out intuitively.  He also found it difficult to pull himself away and so did I.  This definitely an activity you can enjoy along with your children.

The overall concept for this teaching tool is interesting because it involves three layers of play.  There is the overall game of rescuing the king who is trapped in the castle which is used as a tool to motivate the player to learn new chess skills that allow them to progress in this higher order game.  Embedded within this larger framework are a number of clever chess teaching games where you can record high scores and learn various skills.  These can be selected from within an animated room, which gives the player some freedom of choice.  Additionally, there are other fun games that are not necessarily related to chess, but that allow the player to relax their chess concentration and refresh themselves for tackling more difficult chess skills challenges.

I also think it's good that kids could join [...] for a year and play against others as part of the purchase price.  This gives them an arena to apply their chess knowledge and is a good community that is always available.  There are other online chess communities that are free, but I still think this is a nice added bonus.

I don't think any parent could go wrong purchasing this software for their child.  It's good for hundreds or even thousands of hours of entertainment and its powered by an excellent chess engine.  However, you can't play a game of chess against the computer with it.  It is ONLY a teaching tool.  However, you can buy Fritz Grandmaster Software for about [...] which does have this capability at a very low price point compared to other products of comparable playing ability.  I've heard criticisms of Fritz 9 and my understanding is the extra cost does not add a lot of value.  In fact, at this point there seems to be some bugs with Fritz 9.

If you purchase this product, you won't be disappointed.  I wish they had it when I was learning to play chess

Learn to Play Chess with Fritz and Chesster 2, continues where the first CD left off.  Like the first CD, this program may take some guessing regarding what exactly is one supposed to do, and clicking on the crown in the upper right corner helps to navigate through the game.  

This program is really good for grasping the basic tactics and strategies because your progress is measured and you have to develop certain skill proficiency before moving to higher level and learning more tactics and strategies.

The CD covers some popular opening moves, middle game tactics like pins, forks, skewers and deflection, and mating strategies in end game.  With practice on this CD, you can begin to win some games, and then move on to Learn to Play Chess with Fritz and Chesster 3, which is out in German, and is supposed to be out soon in English

Although this game maybe aimed for kids, it can still offer powerful training games in an entertaining way. Each assorted machines is like an arcade that trains each tactical aspects individually. Such as blind Chess, eye-training, memory training of chess positions are most notable that separates it from the other beginner chess training programs. 

The only thing I hate bout this game is the lack of options. You can't log off to a different username without having to shutdown the program first then relog nor can you delete usernames. No BGMs (backgroundmusic)during chess matches. 

Other than that, its an awesome tactical training tool. Kids really do love to play this game and is one of the best games out there that can get them into playing Chess. I think Chess can be a beneficial contribution to school learning and thinking process.

My children absolutely love this version. They wake at 5 a.m. to play before school. My son says "it's great--I've learned lots of tips, and now I'm a much better chess player." 

Why a 4-star and not 5? The down-side--the game doesn't allow the player to "save" at a certain level--totally frustrates the kids when they want to return, they have to start at the beginning again

My kids (6 and 8) are learning so much from Fritz and Chesster 2!!  In fact, my 6 year old daughter started winning a few games at their local chess club after graduating to this game (from Fritz and Chesster 1).  

Today I decided to play with them (since they don't like to play against each other - they're still working on that "good sportsmanship" thing), and I let them team up against me.  I was viewing this as an opportunity to help them think ahead, predict moves, and protect their pieces.  

However, I was the one who learned!!  They surprised me again and again by reciting strategies (move your bishops and knights out, save your Queen for the real battle, don't move your pawns willy nilly, break your oponnent's wall, etc...) they had learned from this game.

They also knew the relative value of the pieces, but could see advantages to making uneven swaps sometimes.  For example, they shocked me by sacrificing a bishop for a pawn in order to open a hole in my wall, which they later exploited to checkmate my  king.  This was a strategy that even 1 month ago would have been unthinkable to them.

Anyway, I defer to other more experienced chess players and computer users who have made specific comments about graphics, dialogue, and strategies.  I am sure that at some point, my kids will move beyond this game and what it has to offer.  

But for now I couldn't be happier with the Chesster and Fritz games!  My kids absolutely love playing the computer games and are really learning to play chess - and not just "computer chess", but chess that lets them beat other kids at chess club - not to mention me.  

I think I'm going to go demand a rematch :)

I bought this based on the Amazon reviews.  I am extremely new at this but the software is pretty good.  The teacher is somewhat annoying and as another reviewer said, he sings over his playing way too much.  I wish there was a way to turn him WAY down and the guitar up.  It touts having over 160 lessons, but that is somewhat misleading.  I don't doubt it has over 160 pages, but I covered 23 "lessons" in about an hour.  I do like the fact that the first few lessons he teaches you very easy versions of the chords so you don't feel hung up on doing the full chords when your fingers don't  want to move to strange new positions they aren't used to.  I am using this as well as Fender's DVD for acoustic with Keith Wyatt.  The DVD is a little more challenging for me, but Keith Wyatt is much better than the guy from the eMedia software (and he doesn't feel the need to sing!!!).  Overall, I would recommend this software

Well presented, easy to follow along, and easy to revisit previous lessons.  Videos and illustrated fretboard really help see and hear how the song should be played.  Not a lot of depth in the material but probably about the right level to maintain the attention of most students.  Some of the accompanyment/singing could be better but overall does a good job presenting the music so the student can practice along. Some of the material/songs may not be to everyones liking, but again, these are okay for the beginner.  The singing can be a slight destraction sometimes. I probably wouldn't recommend this to be the only source of learning guitar....and I don't think most people buying it would think it's all the will every need to become a great guitar player.  I'm sure a teacher would still be very advantageous especially when it comes to pointing out bad habits that may creep into the new students technique. I'm trying to learn without a teacher as well and have found other music books very useful.  
Bottom line;  This is a good product and provides a good start at learning to play the guitar.

I was sceptical about buying this product after reading one of the reveiws about having some trouble with Quicktime. Anyways, I had no problems with this program at all. Guitar is my favorite instrument. I've always wanted to learn how to play guitar. I even bought the cheap $10 dollar videos that basically rush through everything and left me frustrated, and playing the chords all wrong. This video is SO MUCH FUN!!!! I thought I could never play guitar after being so discouraged from learning from other videos. I figured, ok, this is a little more expensive, but at least I will learn how to play over 70 songs!!! I'm so happy that I bought this video. It is worth every penny. I'm currently on the 42nd lesson. Mind you, this video is not one of those "we move along quickly, so if you didn't get it, just rewind" videos. Oh no, this video makes you practice the chords many times so it's in your head. When you're done with this video, you'll feel so confindent. It's like having your own private instructor. Certain things I was doing wrong I no longer do. It has even cleaned up my fingering technique. I have no more words, it's a great video and you can't go wrong with Amazon's price.

With 20 grandkids and 3 great grandkids, I have spent many hours with them playing games on the comptuer.  Almost all of them like all types of games, but the I Spy Series is one of the most played series that I have.  The I SPY TREASURE HUNT notes ages 6 to 10 and they must have done a lot of testing to be able to devlop a game that is actually challenging and interesting for adults,  and yet can actually be played by young kids as well.  The I Spy series has always had very hight quality games, and this is at the top of the list for me.  I will warn you though, that if you play with your kids, be prepaired to surprised. My usual play is for me to help the kids search, and not find items and tell them, but if they get stuck, point out an area to look at.  With this one, I have a seven year old that was finishing finding the last 4 or five items before I could find even one of them.  Great play for everyone.  Super recommended

I purchased this game for my 3 year old who already reads a little and knows her numbers well. I hoped this game would help her learn addition. She loves to play it, but several of the games require hand coordination beyond her ability (the hand cart one in particular, as noted by another reviewer), and catching bubbles. It was frustrating to me because she knew the proper answer but could not "execute" because her movements were too slow. Over time, she has improved enough to play most of the games on level one. The game is very engaging ang the graphics well-done, but the educational part is under-emphasized. The game that "teaches" addition involves frogs jumping to lily-pads and my daughter is so focused on the frogs that the addition lesson is hardly noticed

I was amazed how colorful the graphics are in this game.  My 6 year took right to it and played it for 2 hours the first sitting.  She mastered level 2 pretty easy and is on to level 3.  Our computer runs windows and we have had no problems.  This is a great game to buy for the summer to keep kids up to speed between K and 1st grade

Finally, fresh new characters which are adorable. I am a converted Kutoka buyer as I have now bought a 3rd item from them. I was so impressed with the Mia Reading and Mia Language that I wanted to try this multi-subject game for my twin girls in kindergarten. This game is a great compliment to mia reading as it reinforces literacy and other subjects like math and problem solving. We haven't played with the art part yet but I still think it's a great value for the other subjects. I'm really impressed how it helps to develop their cognitive skills and patience as one of my girls has a problem with concentration but found through the problem solving activities that she is overcoming these difficulties. Great product. Even my neighbours kids come over to play it!

(Responding to Joel G's review below)

It's unfortunate that your child was unable to enjoy Didi & Ditto because of a technical problem you had with your computer. The majority of Didi & Ditto players are running Microsoft Windows and enjoying this great educational software.

If you send us an e-mail message at service@kutoka.com, I am sure that someone from our technical support team will be able to help you resolve the issue you seem to have experienced with your computer display.

Also note that all activites can be unlocked in the Activities menu by pressing the F6 key on your keyboard. A full list of the game's keyboard shortcuts can be found in the user's guide which is accessible from the Start menu.

Hope this helps

My 4 year old son received this as a Christmas present.  He has really enjoyed playing it so far.  He can do most of the activities without help.  There is one part where you have to ride a cart down a mountain and click buttons to duck or jump, which I think is pretty hard for little ones (it actually took me a couple of tries to make it down the mountain).  There are many different learning activities:  matching, memory, shapes, size, etc. We did not have any problems loading the game on our computer as another reviewer did.  We have a new Dell computer running on windows XP

Adobe Standard 8.0 is worth the upgrade from earlier versions. If you do research and want a better interface, design and functions then you need this new version of Adobe. It is an incredible tool for gathering, sorting, copying and formatting information. It also is faster than older versions. See details (above) on Amazon. Recommended for all information-knowledge workers

The operating system is a very good operating system for a home computer.  But, obviously, if you want a computer with more security features or networking features, you should go with Windows XP Professional.  At the time that I am writing this, which is a long time from when I purchased Windows XP, it is a time where Windows Vista is emerging.  If you plan on upgrading a slightly older computer, I recommend Windows XP Home/Professional (based on your requirements).  But if you are looking for a safe operating system for your beast, try Windows Vista.  But one word of warning about Vista, the User Account Control (UAC) is a pain in the butt

Rosetta Stome Spanish compared to other Spanish courses, NOT from the viewpoint of a Gringa, but a Latina (Mexicana)

Rosetta Stone Spanish is the third major Spanish course that I am buying. 
I have comtpleted all of the Spanish lessons in the Pimsleur series, and have also completed Learning Spanish Like Crazy Level One and Two. 
I am one of those rare Latinas that did not learn Spanish from my parents. My Mexican parents felt that it would be easier to "assimilate" if I only spoke English. After going to my grandparents' home for holidays and being the only one there that did not speak Spanish, and after having Latino strangers speak to me in Spanish and then look at me in astonishment when I struggled just to say "no, hablo espanol," I felt that it was time for me to learn how to speak my language. 

The first course that I used was Pimsleur Spanish. Compared to Rosetta Stone I must say that I learned much more vocabulary with the Rosetta Stone software. But I recommend Pimsleur over Rosetta Stone, especially for the complete beginner. Because of its easy teaching method, in my opinion Pimsleur is even better than LSLC for someone that has no experience whatsoever speaking Spanish. Pimsluer goes at a very slow pace. But if you have already learned some Spanish on your own or in high school or college, then you can probably skip Pismleur and go straight to LSLC. Or if you are the type of person that believes learning a foreign language should be more like a hurdle than a marathon you'll probably want to go with Learning Spanish Like Crazy. LSLC covers a lot more Spanish words and grammar than Pimsleur and moves at a quicker pace. 

So where does Rosetta Stone fit in? 

I would say use Rosetta Stone after you have completed the above courses. It is difficult to really learn how to speak Spanish with this software alone because you are only looking at pictures and repeating the phrases that you hear. You never really learn how to think in Spanish and create your own sentences. So why am I still giving it 4 stars? 

Because if you already know how to speak some Spanish from another course and you are on an intermediate level then you can add plenty more Spanish words to your vocabulary by using the Rosetta Stone software. One negative about this course is that the method is tedious because the software's interface is "antiquated" with photos from the 1980s. And the sound quality is not as clear as Pimsleur or Learning Spanish Like Crazy. But if you stick it out through the drudgery, you will be surprised with how many Spanish words you learned with this software. 

But I think Pimsleur did a better job of teaching me concepts than this software is doing. And by teaching me concepts, I have really retained the material and by understanding concepts, I am able to take my own thoughts and form sentences. Something that I would not have been able to do if I had used this course alone. 

Another negative about this course, is that unlike the other two courses that I mentioned, you have to use Rosetta Stone while sitting in a computer. That is difficult for me because I am very busy with classes, work and my personal life. I can use Pimsleur or LSLC on my mp3 player and not have to worry about sitting at a computer. 

Besides the limited vocabulary and the slow teaching method, the only downside of Pimsleur is that it does not teach the same Spanish words that are most commonly used by Mexicans and other Latinos in regular conversation. Pimsleur Spanish is very formal Spanish. We say "mucho gusto" like LSLC teaches, Pimsleur teaches "encantado." And in our overly "macho" culture if a man responds with "encantado" many Latinos may get the wrong impression about him. It is not something that I am proud to say about my (Latino) culture, but it is true. And Pimsleur does not warn the male student that if you say "encantado" to some Latinos they may get the wrong impression about the speaker. 

Learning Spanish Like Crazy has taught me useful practical Spanish that I can use to communicate with my Spanish speaking friends and family. When I tell people that I learned to speak Spanish as an adult and not at home as a child, many of them do not believe me. I think they find it incredible for two reasons: 

One, my accent really sounds like a native Speaker from using LSLC. Two, I have learned real conversational Spanish from LSLC. I have learned words and phrases that Spanish speakers actually use when speaking to each other. PImsleur taught me Spanish that the author of the course thought that I should speak, not the Spanish that Latinos really speak. That is one of the positive things that separates LSLC course from the others. 

So in what order would I rate the three in terms of EASE of teaching method: 

1. Pimsleur Spanish 
2. Learning Spanish Like Crazy 
3. Rosetta Stone Spanish 

But in terms of teaching real conversational Spanish and teaching a real Latin American accent, I rate them as follows: 


1. Learning Spanish Like Crazy 
2. Pimsleur Spanish 
3. Rosetta Stone Spanish

Expecially great is the speaking unit which allows you to match your pronunciation with that of the instructor.  The package is well worth the cost

It was a relief for me to be able to keep and upgrade Word and Excel, and to get Virtual PC (for Access) as well. I used them a lot on my PC a few years ago, and when I first switched to Mac, couldn't find software that did what they did. I had no trouble installing the upgrade on my iMac G5, nor did I have trouble installing Virtual PC. The only thing that WAS disappointing was that I couldn't find out whether accessing the Internet from Virtual PC would open me up to PC-type viruses, or if Mac's Unix system would protect me there, too.  I continue to be disappointed that the Mac version of this software is not as rich as the PC version. But the upgrade itself worked well for what it was meant to do

A great bargain - you get full office Professional, VP and full version of Windows for under $300 dollars. After waiting for months and months for Office 2004 Professional to be released, when it finally came out I was ecstatic. One problem: VP 7.0 wouldn't install on my G5, only on my laptop. I called Microsoft support and within minutes they told me that they were working on a patch for machines with over 2.0 GB of ram. I downloaded the update a week later when it came out and everything is now golden. The moral of the story is that Microsoft underestimates the needs of Mac users because they are used to wimpy PCs that have no ram

The Rosetta Stone language software was a great investment. The product provides learning words together with listening, seeing, and hearing or the user can select one of these individually or even practice writing words and phrases. It provides an easy to use interface and you can learn at your own pace. The product has been worth it's hefty price. I do recommend purchasing a German/English dictionary to accompany the  software. I have also had in the past a basic German 101 course prior to using Rosetta Stone, so it may be difficult to start for a person with no knowledge of the German language, such as pronunciation of basic words or greetings

I first heard about this product in a bad review of a different software product for converting LPs to CDs.  After a little research, I decided to try this product of the many that are out there.  This software is not expensive and for me, it does what I expected it to do.  It is easy to set up and use, and I am using it with an Audio-Technica PL120 turntable.  The first LP I converted was Stevie Wonder's Innervisions, and with this album in particular, the songs run together, i.e. there is no separation between the tracks.  This software allowed me to create fairly accurate tracks so I could access individual songs.  I also cleaned up some background noise with the "one click" noise reduction, and the music from this old album sounds great.  This is my first software for this purpose so unfortunately I cannot compare it to others.  What I can tell you is that it is inexpensive, easy to use, and it does what it says it will do

I purchased this product to put 2 CDs together.  I had never attempted something like this and was a total novice.  Audio Cleaning Lab was terrific!  I found it easy to understand and use, with unexpected options that improved the project I was working on. My one word to describe it--- simple....or maybe...effective...or maybe...straightforward...or maybe...uncomplicated...or maybe...useful...or maybe...valuable...or maybe..

I came across Magix Audio Cleaning Lab about 4 years ago.  Once I got the hang of it, I really liked it.  However, I kept wondering if there were better programs out there.  I mean, really, how good can it be for $39, right?  I recently paid $75 for Sony's famed Sound Forge Studio (which is the Sound Forge program minus various some features).  I spent a lot of time with Sound Forge Studio, working to perfect my transfer of some private music recordings from cassette to CD.  I was happy with what I was able to accomplish with Sound Forge.  At least I thought I was happy.  I compared my work in Sound Forge Studio to the same cassette transfer I did with Magix Audio Cleaning Lab 10 (the previous iteration of this software).  Guess what?  I liked the Magix work much better.  So, I immediately purchased Audio Cleaning Lab 11 and unintalled Sony's Sound Forge Studeio from my computer.  Magix could charge $150 for this software and I would buy it in a second.  Your going to have to take the time to carefully read through the full manual to get the most out of this software - but it is worth the effort.  

This program does the work of software costing 3 times as much.

The main reason for negative reviews in the past was the extra charge for the MP3 encoder. With this version, the MP3 encoder is included. Magix has been pretty clever in designing an interface that can used quickly yet has several more advanced features you can use as you become more proficient. These include a full featured waveform editor and a very powerful sonagram (spectral) editor. Also, somewhat hidden is the ability to record 78rpm records on a 33 1/3 turntable. If you use the full set of features almost any record can be made totally free of pops and clicks. I have two very minor negatives; the amplitude scale on the track display is somewhat truncated, the declicker has so few artifacts  that I recommend always using it at the maximum setting (as opposed to the wizard and manual recommendations.) As far as PC requirements, I believe any program that does a lot of number crunching needs a fairly up-to-date processor. This one particularly so because it leaves the original audio files intact. I don't believe this is a negative as in some prior reviews. In short, I have been totally satisfied with this program's ability to make clean transfers of both 78rpm and 33 1/3 rpm records.

In my opionion, Act! is clearly still the best contact manager on the market. I am not talking about a complex CRM solution, but it is a fine contact manager. I am not using the Outlook and Palm interfaces and I don't have any complains other than it is slow if you are running many programs at the same time.

The built in email features are okay, seach features are excellent. Just give it a 30 day trial and compare to Goldmine, Maximizer and others

I think this is actually a very good OS. There are a lot of new features and Home Premium appears to be the best Vista OS for the money. 
I purhased a new PC with this OS and have really found no compelling reason to upgrade to Ultimate for $150. 
Only legitimate gripe concerns drivers for non-microsoft products. Not excatly sure why this is microsoft's problem though. 
Regardless, this OS is the smart choice for a new PC for home use. Accept a minimum required graphics and audio card until suppliers catch up with this new OS. Then upgrade. Otherwise, wait till you need a new PC

If you've been living under a rock for the past year or so, perhaps you can be excused for not having heard about Microsoft's new edition to the 
Windows canon.  For all others, Vista has become a fact of life, whether or not you actually run the operating system yet.  Check out a tech website and you'll find a Vista screen shot somewhere, either depicting some impressive overclocking results via CPU-Z, or else simply for no other purpose than to show the world, "Yes, I can run Aero--aren't you jealous?"  In fact, it's hard to avoid Vista these days.  And, as always seems to be the case, most of what you hear is probably negative.

That's where I come in.  I've waited a while before writing this review, both to test the operating system and to wait for the horror stories to fade away.  They haven't.  And this can only mean one thing: the positive stories aren't getting through because most people who are satisfied with a product generally don't feel the need to comment on it.  Now of course you've probably seen quite a few anxious posts (most likely in all capital letters) either bashing Microsoft for everything under the sun, praising Vista indiscriminately, making it seem as though you need a $5000.00 enthusiast-class computer to run the thing, or boasting about Mac's venerable OS X and how Windows Vista is nothing more than a bad copy thereof.  Needless to say, none of these sorts of things helps, and all of them create a sense of confusion and negativity that reflects heavily on the product.  And, if you analyze them closely, you'll realize that *none of them actually says anything about Windows Vista.*  If you don't believe me, then just go visit Apple's discussion area and check out the iPod pages.  You'd get the impression that iPods were the worst products ever made and that every single one has problems.  Yet, if this were the case, then why have in excess of 100 million units been sold thus far?  The answer is obvious: people seem compelled to review products only if something went wrong with their experience.  In short, people confuse review sites with complaint forums.

Therefore, as the self-proclaimed Dr. Prog, I feel it my duty to step out of my usual mode of reviewing progressive rock albums and give an honest, no nonsense review of Microsoft Windows Vista Home Premium.

-THE INTERFACE-

Ah, yes.  You've heard all about the new Windows Vista Aero interface by now.  And virtually every screen shot you'll ever see will feature Aero.  But it's much more than just pretty, glass-like window frames.  Aero includes many new enhancements to the UI, such as the live thumbnails that appear when you mouse-over minimized windows.  As the name suggests, these actually update in real time, so if there is a video or an animation playing in the window, it will appear in the live thumbnail.  This is very useful.  Perhaps less useful but scoring about an 8 on the 1-10 "coolness factor" scale is the oft-mentioned 3D-Flip, which allows the user to view a three-dimensional representation of all open windows, along with offering the ability to virtually paw through these to bring the desired window to the forefront.  These are the things you'll hear the most about.

What you don't hear so much is all the general changes that have been made to the overall interface.  The new icons are photo-realistic and size-scalable.  They start out a little large, but you can set them to any size within a wide spectrum.  The explorer windows have been radically redressed, with a new breadcrumbs backward navigation tool that beats the old address bar hands down (you can retrace your steps in a logical, step-by-step manner, instead of using the cryptic addresses).  Also, they're spruced up with decorations that recall the visual aura style of some of the new wallpapers.  Speaking of which, these are for the first time actually usable, unlike in previous versions of Windows, where the wallpapers have been small and grainy.

More general changes include the absence of menu bars in most areas of Explorer, including IE.  These can be replaced momentarily with a tap of the Alt key, at least until you learn how to navigate without them.  Also, the animations are much better than in previous versions of Windows, particularly the one you see when copying a file.  In addition, the Start menu has been reworked drastically.  It doesn't even say "Start," anymore; instead, it's simply a blue orb with the Windows logo.  The first big change is the way programs are accessed: gone is the delicate and finicky ever-expanding hierarchy system, where a slightly overzealous hand could miss the mark and close the entire desired level.  Now, the All Programs button leads to an Explorer-like listing of folders, each clearly named, and each of which opens and closes with a single mouse click.  Each time the Start menu is opened, the folders reset themselves.  Also, they are automatically alphabetized.  The Start menu also contains most of the system links usually found on the Desktop (Computer, Documents, etc.), which is why the only thing on the Desktop the first time you boot up is the Recycle Bin.  And, in case you have seen screen shots or have tried out Vista already, the search bar at the bottom pulls double duty as a replacement for the Run command utility.

Speaking of search, though I seldom ever find myself wondering where my files are (I suppose I'm unique in this respect), many people have far more data to keep track of than me, and thus they will greatly appreciate the enhanced and pervasive searching facilities of Vista.  There are search boxes virtually everywhere in Explorer, including the Start menu.  There is even one in IE7, though it is not integrated with the system search.

But, as you've probably noticed, this is but a list of interface changes and additions.  I assure you the list could go on and on, and I know I'll receive more than one comment reminding me about some feature or other I've forgotten.  I'll read those when they come and add material as necessary.  But, aside from this, how does this new interface really impact the end user?  To be perfectly honest, though it's certainly pretty and a few parts of it required a little adjustment, it didn't feel much different from previous Windows versions to me.  But, to be honest, this is a good thing.  Perhaps you've heard that it's a nightmare to learn Vista.  That's a load of hogwash.  A few things are renamed, a few things have been moved around, and on the whole everything looks prettier.  But it's still Windows; it accomplishes the same tasks and it works virtually the same as it always did.

-INCLUDED SOFTWARE BUNDLE-

Taking a hint from Apple, Microsoft has included a compliment of digital media manipulation software.  While of course iLife is superior, there is one issue that must be cleared up: iLife is not an integral part of Mac OS X as you may have been led to believe.  Older Mac users must purchase it; it only comes with the newer Macs.  Therefore, Microsoft Windows Vista, to be purely technical, offers the most comprehensive digital media suite ever offered stock with an OS.  However, technicality is seldom practical, and Microsoft's inclusion is no iLife killer.  Still, the included calendar (new in Vista), photo viewing and editing application (new), Windows Media Player 11, Windows Movie Maker, and Windows DVD burning program (new) are nothing to scoff at.  No, they won't replace dedicated, professional stand-alone programs, but let's be honest: neither will iLife.

The new Internet Explorer 7 is a step forward from the piece of Swiss cheese IE6 was, insofar as security.  New features include a phishing filter, tabbed browsing, and improved security.  Additionally, IE7 runs in protected mode, also called a "sandbox."  The idea is that this one application is cordoned off from the rest of the system, thereby making it more difficult for malicious software to take control of your computer.  But that's more for the security section of the review.  The new IE7 is certainly more attractive than the older versions, and the version in Vista offers enhanced visual appeal that the XP port of the software lacks.  To be perfectly honest, I still use Mozilla Firefox (mostly because I can't stand those blinking ads on Web pages, and there is a Firefox extension that gets rid of that annoyance once and for all), but if I had to, I would have no qualms using IE7. 

The new incarnation of Window Media Player is really no different from the XP port.  It still doesn't support AAC, and it still doesn't handle gapless playback.  As an iPod user and a progressive rock fan, respectively, I can gather only one thing from these shortcomings: it's time to break out iTunes.  Don't get me wrong: WMP is not at all a bad tool.  It's still the default player on my system for most audio types.  However, once an iPod owner and prog rocker, always an iPod owner/progger.  I still say iTunes is king, if only because its interface is cleaner, it supports my audio device, and it offers gapless playback.

I haven't extensively tested the Windows Movie Maker application, but I have read that it is updated very slightly from the XP version.  The photo  editing tool is completely new for Vista, and after a little experimenting I was pleased that, though simple, the controls offer nice results.  This  application is on par with many of the basic image editing software packages you'll see offered with digital cameras, printers, and the like.  The other applications have yet to receive my testing, only because I don't often burn DVD movies, and I haven't entered an event in a calendar in about ten years.

As far as Windows Mail, I cannot be objective because I have never used Outlook or Outlook Express.  Reports seem to indicate that Windows Mail is simply a dressed-up Outlook Express, with many of the same features.  As I said, I have never used a mail program.  Call me old-fashioned, but I just check and write my mail from my Internet browser.  Either way, I don't honestly believe Microsoft would offer Outlook-level functionality in the stripped down version of Outlook 2007.

All in all, I was rather impressed at the steps Microsoft has taken to embrace the digital media age.  The effort falls short of iLife and proprietary solutions in this regard, but then, that is simply to be expected.  I haven't really benefited tremendously from the new additions, but there is certainly nothing wrong with them, and I know many people will be very happy with this digital media suite.

-SECURITY-

This is the big picking point many people (rightfully) have with Windows XP.  It seems as though there's at least two critical security updates every week.  The Mac commercials definitely have a point, but that's only because Macs make up so small a percentage of the market share (though it is indeed a growing share) that it is not advantageous for malware to be written for OS X users.  Even so, XP doesn't get a free pass here.  Something had to be done.  And that something was the security measures taken in Windows Vista.

The "sandbox" has already been mentioned above, but other features have been added.  One of these, Windows Defender (Microsoft's anti-spyware program), is one of those rare pieces of software that is just perfect: It may not be the best at what it does, but it's unobtrusive, it's simple to use, and it's totally and completely free.  Leave it on to supplement your already existing spyware solution, and you can only benefit.

Also featured in Vista is the now infamous User Account Control (UAC).  Basically, it prompts you every time your computer does basically anything, including installing programs, running some programs, updating settings, etc.  And, if you were wondering, the Mac commercials have it right: It really is that annoying.  To be fair, you will see far fewer of these alerts once the bulk of your software has been installed, but until then you will be very, very sick of UAC.  I don't advise this, but since I was able to get my anti-virus and anti-spyware software up and running on Vista, I finally turned off UAC.  Symantic seems to think this was unwise, but Norton Virus Scan doesn't bother me about it other than to recommend, on its information page, that I leave UAC activated.  Yeah.  Like that's going to happen.

Beyond these broad, tangible aspects of security, there is a lot of new stuff under the hood of Vista that makes it less susceptible to malicious attacks.  Mostly, unless you're very savvy, you don't need to understand it all and, to be frank, don't ask me because I haven't the foggiest how it all works.  I'm just glad it's there.

Overall, I think Microsoft has made a valiant effort with security.  I would still not advise running any Windows operating system without active virus and spyware protection, but at least Vista has taken a step in the right direction.  Plus, you likely have anti-virus and anti-spyware software from running Windows XP, which you can then install on Vista.

-THE HARDWARE-

Graphics:

This is the part I have been waiting for.  Everything I read up until I finally installed Vista told me I needed a dedicated graphics card with at least 256 MB of memory in order to run Aero.  I'll be honest: I fell for it.  I had a graphics card *in my hand*, but on the way to the checkout I realized I had left my gift certificate at home.  So I decided to wait and see how my hardware would react.  This is where I realized the utter bias among the tech community: I had absolutely no trouble running Aero on integrated graphics.  And that only makes sense because my setup is rather typical: a 17" flat panel monitor and a modern computer.  This will be what the majority of people have at the moment, and at this size, IG should have no trouble running Aero.  Now use logic: If you want to run dual 24" widescreen monitors, yeah, you'll need a graphics card.  Especially since I don't believe there even exists a dual monitor-capable IG motherboard (if there is such a thing, it's certainly not available on the OEM consumer market).  But if you have a fairly typical single monitor scenario on a computer that you bought within the past few years, you should have no trouble at all insofar as graphics.  Don't be fooled.  If you want to be absolutely sure, however, there is no harm--and plenty of good sense--in downloading Microsoft's free Upgrade Advisor utility to see if your setup is in any way deficient.  Plus, if you find you can't run Aero for any reason, you were going to upgrade to Vista anyway, so you  can still buy dedicated graphics at that point.  You don't need the top-of-the-line card unless you want to make this an excuse to foray into gaming; older technology that will get you up and running can be had for very reasonable prices.

RAM:

There is one area, however, where many computers will be deficient: RAM.  Oddly enough, while many sources are pushing the graphics card brigade, an almost equally strong force--the computer manufacturers themselves--seems to think that RAM is no big deal.  Trust me: If you've ever tried to run Windows XP on 256 MB of RAM, it's a painful experience.  That's what Vista is like on 512 MB--you don't even want to go there.  Dell is shockingly honest when they qualify the "minimum" Vista requirement of 512 MB of RAM (as per Microsoft) as "Great for booting the operating system, without running any applications or games."  This is where most people will have to upgrade their machines.  1 GB is perfectly acceptable; if you want true multitasking power (and you have the dual-core processor to support it), then go for 2 GB or more.  For most people, however, 1 GB will be fine.  My first of two Vista machines has 1 GB and it works perfectly.  I will warn you, though, that often times memory is installed in pairs, so your 512 MB is most likely two 256 MB modules.  The paired method offers better performance, but it will make upgrading a system with only two memory slots somewhat expensive (though not exorbitant by any means).  But this is not somewhere you want to skimp, so at least one pair of 512 MB memory modules should be on your list of extra hardware if you have only 512 MB of memory currently installed.

Processor:

This is perhaps the most accurate in terms of the hype.  You'll need at least a 1 GHz processor to run Aero.  Many computers with such processors don't even support 1 GB of RAM, so if you're in that situation, you will definitely be looking at a new computer with Vista pre-installed.  However, these are very old machines by this point, and most of us have something slightly newer.  One myth that needs to be dispelled is that dual-core processors will run Vista better than single-core CPUs: Vista is, for the most part, based on the Microsoft Server 2003 code, which is, in turn, based on the XP code, both of which came before the advent of multi-core processing.  Therefore, to the effect that the operating system is run, there will be only a marginal difference between a single-core or a dual-core CPU, provided both use identical core architectures.  Of course any applications that take advantage of multi-threading will benefit from multiple cores, but this was, is, and will always be the case, independent of the operating system.  The question is simply whether you see yourself multitasking more with Vista.  If that's the case, then a new computer with a dual-core processor installed is probably your best bet; if you're fine with your current setup, then it will most likely run Vista and Aero without any problems.  It is interesting to note, however, that some upgrade aptitude utilities have some small quirks and will give conflicting and non-real results.  For example, such a utility offered by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) passed both my A64 X2-based machines without a hitch.  However, when on a whim I ran it on my old P4-based desktop, the utility seemed to think that a 2.40B GHz Pentium 4 Northwood (533 FSB) would be insufficient to run Vista.  I smell AMD bias, even though I happen to favor AMD over Intel.  Just take what such utilities tell you with a grain of salt, and remember that Microsoft's own utility is likely the most reliable.  Generally, your processor will not be an issue when upgrading to Vista.

Hard Drive:

Again, this one is pretty straightforward.  If you have a 40 GB hard drive or better, you're good to go.  And if you don't have that, hard drives are so cheap these days that you could easily at least triple your current capacity for about what it costs to take the family out to dinner one evening (Amazon does not allow price figures, hence my vagueness regarding pricing throughout this review).

Things get interesting when you consider a dual boot scenario.  This is when you have two operating systems running on the same system, either on the same or on different hard drives.  In my honest opinion, this is the best way to go because you get to keep your current operating system (just in case you run into problems with Vista), and you also get to have Vista.  Keep in mind that, in order to run Vista on the same hard drive as your current OS, you'll need to install each OS on a separate partition.  You can either purchase a third party partitioning tool, or do what I did, which was use the Ubuntu Linux live boot disc's built-in partitioning utility.  Of course there is risk involved with this last solution (but, in my experience, I've used it dozens of times with no problems), so do the latter only at your own risk.

-COMPATIBILITY-

This is where most of the horror stories have come from.  Both hardware and software compatibility nightmares are flitting around in denser clusters than fish flies in June.  Up until recently, anti-virus and anti-spyware programs have been unable to install on Vista.  In addition, many proprietary printer applications are incompatible, yet the printer itself will often times function perfectly.  Graphics and sound card drivers still haven't really caught up, despite the fact that they've had a little over two years to do so.  I won't deny that, if your system just happens to roll the snake eyes, you're in for some hell.

But it's not half as bad as you hear.  I installed Vista without a hitch; there is a separate part of the process where the OS scans the system for hardware, installs the necessary drivers, and then generates a list of anything that doesn't install properly.  Every piece of hardware I had was recognized.  In addition, my printer was recognized and installed in about five seconds, despite the fact that its own software would not install (and that its maker, HP, still hadn't posted a Vista-compatible version).  Even my USB Internet modem, which the Upgrade Advisor flat out said would not work with Vista, installed and ran perfectly when I supplied the drivers from the manufacturer's website.  The fact is, Vista has shipped with exponentially more drivers than any edition of XP.  Plus, it's possible to supply drivers from manufacturers' websites for the odd, esoteric bit of hardware that isn't immediately detected.  Sometimes it will work, sometimes not.  But this is only to be expected when upgrading to a new OS.  I don't seem to remember everything being rosy when XP came out, either.  This is yet another item of strong support for a dual boot scenario.

Software is no different from hardware.  All my software titles, with the possible exception of the ancient original Roller Coaster Tycoon, work flawlessly with Vista.  And the latter didn't work with Windows XP MCE 2005, either, so I don't blame Vista for this.  If your software acts buggy or otherwise just won't work, check the manufacturer's website.  If it's a fairly recent title, there will most likely be some compatibility patches or a whole new version of the application, all free of charge.  Just be ready to insert your product key, if required, in the latter case.  Now of course chances are that if you have some pet application from the mid-nineties, it might kick up a few Dickens.  Again, a strong case for dual boot.

The final and perhaps most prolific source of upgrade hell is, ironically, the upgrade itself.  This process works by performing an in-place upgrade of an already existing operating system (XP).  These sorts of upgrades are notorious for problems, and the Vista crop is no exception.  However, since you're currently viewing the full version page, this obviously isn't an issue for you.  Just remember, the best ways to install Vista are either as a clean installation (if necessary obliterating an existing OS) or a dual boot scenario.  Anything else and you might experience problems.  But this has always been the case with in-place upgrades.

-OVERALL-

I thank you for reading this far.  Most people won't.  I know this was pretty long, but I wanted to get it all out there for people to read.  Vista is not a bad operating system.  Was I absolutely floored with it?  It may require some more time, but it hasn't been the revelation Microsoft promised.  This is somewhat disappointing, and yet, somewhat reassuring as well.  I didn't suffer any downtime because I couldn't figure out how the operating system works, I didn't have any glaring compatibility issues, and my computer has worked virtually error-free ever since I first installed the OS. In short, the change, while not mind blowing, wasn't drastic or disturbing, either.  At the end of the day, just remember: It's Windows.  Love it or leave it, it's just Microsoft's operating system.  Vista will do the same thing as XP and earlier editions; it's not a source of inspiration or drive.  It's only as good as the person who's using it.

I am a retired attorney who has experimented with earlier versions of the Dragon software over the last eight to 10 years.  I was never quite satisfied with the performance of the product.  However, I now own version 9 and have found it to be a very useful and accurate product.  If I were still practicing law, I would unquestionably utilize a program like this in my practice.  Because I did not like being tied to my computer by a microphone cable, I purchased a wireless microphone (by Nady - which I have also reviewed) which works even better than the wired headset that came with the program.  The program required less than one-half hour of setup although I have continued to train the program to meet the needs of my particular voice patterns.  This dictation is much more accurate than my typing, and I have found that correcting errors is a fairly simple process as well.  My only regret is that I purchased the basic program, rather than an advanced program.  Now that I see how well the product works, I wish that I had a more specialized vocabulary and the ability to dictate in more than just English as I am fluent in Spanish and have a growing acquaintance with French.  Incidentally, I dictated this review and use the dictation program regularly to respond to and send e-mails, as well as dictate letters, memoranda and outlines in Microsoft word.  It may be relevant to note that I am not using an underpowered computer system.  I have an AMD dual core system with 2 MB of RAM.  I am certain that there is a combination of good programming and growing computer power that makes a program such as this functional

Voice recognition software continues to improve.  I've been using versions of this software since 1998 and can see significant improvements in the voice recognition technology over that period.

Before investing in this software, though, check carefully the specifications of your PC.  The faster the processor and the more RAM you have, the better the results.  The software will run on the minimum specification identified, but it may not run fast enough to satisfy the needs of some us.

This software is useful in many circumstances.  Many of us can speak faster than we can type and many of us compose as we type.  The software can be used with a range of eMail clients as well as in word processing and other software.  

You can, as it claims, obtain reasonable voice recognition results with a few minutes of set up and training.  But for optimal use, and the best return on investment, consider using the voice command capabilities to drive other software.  This takes more effort initially but can deliver significant benefits.

I'll be buying a new PC before I look at upgrading this software.

Highly recommended.

I have been aware of NaturallySpeaking for over 15 years.  We initially utilized this software to assist people with severe disabilities such as cerebral palsy to be able to have basic commands understood.  More recently five years ago I bought edition 4.0.  I found it to be frustrating when ever there was any background noise so I basically quit using it.  When I saw the 8.0 being advertised as the voice recognition software specifically for a small business atmosphere, I thought I would try it one more time.  Being a slow typist it has truly changed my life for the better.  Only 45 minutes were required to set up the speech-recognition files when the occasional mistakes occur during dictation if you correct those and change those right at that time, I never see that same misunderstanding happening again.  I have recommended it to two friends who are buying it.  It really does allow you to sit back in your chair relax, drink your coffee and dictate reports, answer e-mail or whenever it is you might need to do.  I can't think of any $70 expenditure that has given me so much back in such a short time.  I almost always have my headset on when I'm in front of the computer because anything that involves typing or entering data I used the DragonDictate to do

I checked the reviews on many types of dictation software before selecting Dragon NaturallySpeaking 8 standard.  I recently had my wrist operated on and knew that I would be unable to write utilizing my hand for quite a while.  As an online student going to college I had to be able to participate in discussion boards and research papers daily.  This software was unbelievably easy to learn.  I followed the directions on setting it up so that the computer would recognize my voice.  I spent approximately 5 hours learning to program, and practicing before I was operated on.  I found that if I talked at my own natural speed the computer utilizing this software did an excellent job of deciphering my words.  I found the instructions very simple to follow.  Yes there were times that the computer displayed what I said incorrectly, but correcting it was extremely easy.
I was able to keep up with my class throughout the six weeks I was in a cast.  My arm is still in a brace and I'm still using the software on a daily basis.  I'm actually using the software to write this review.  I highly recommend this software to anyone that needs to write research papers or that does a lot of computer typing on a daily basis.
I am such a strong believer in the software that I know I will continue to use it even when my brace comes off.
I found the software very compatible and easy to use even to answer my e-mails quickly and efficiently.
This might be the perfect software to get for any college student.  To be able to look at research books and talk into the computer as you're looking up reference material is truly beneficial.  It was also very easy to stop Dragon software when you needed to to take a break think what you needed to write next.  All I needed to say was "go to sleep" and the microphone shuts off until you wake it out.
To sum it all up the software was very easy to use and easy to set up.  I recommend it highly.

In my experience really learning a language requires a mix of learning approaches. That means books, tapes, tutoring, and experience in a country that uses it. I have done all of these and feel this product is well worth including in the mix. I highly reccomend it. If you're serious you need to just pony up the money and use it.

We ordered this program only two weeks before moving to Bogota, Columbia for a two year tour.  However, the Spanish Rosetta Stone taught was much higher level than the survival Spanish we needed when we arrived.  Overall we are learning the language and it is a GREAT program.  Wish we would have bought it 3 or 4 months before departing

I have used this software for about 4 weeks since posting my comment in reply to that review.  Having now had a chance to use the software, I can only say that I am almost 100% satisfied with it.  Some times, it's nice to have a spanish dictionary when after a few lessons, you still can't quite grasp the concept of the word you're being taught, but other than that...

Yes, it is repetitious.  For those who want to learn another language, this is to be expected.  No, it's not a magic pill.

However, in as little as three weeks I found myself largely able to understand what native speakers around me were talking about, even if my understanding of it was imperfect.

Repetition (as they say) is key, but even if it were not, dedication is absolutely required.  You can only learn if you stick with the program, and even I have been rather lax about that much.  Still, I am wholly satisfied with my purchase.  It is clear to me that the program is only as good as its user though, and I really ought to be more dedicated to following it

If you are serious about learning Spanish this software isn't enough. You will need to purchase a Spanish-English dictionary - I like Barron's Spanish Dictionary because it came with a free down loadable software version - and a Spanish audio series such as Pimsleur or Learning Spanish Like Crazy (LSLC). A verb conjugation book is a good idea too, I like The big Red Book of 555 Spanish Verbs. Finally, just like back in the day, you should either buy flashcards or create your own to build up your vocabulary when you can't stand to look at the computer monitor even one second longer.

Now here's the part of the puzzle that Rosetta Stone will help you with: it is very repetitive and requires interaction with picture/word association. I have found that this burns the words into my mind and that the photos help me to recall a word or phrase. Rosetta Stone will also help you with reading comprehension as well as spelling - as long as you use all the lesson plans and resist the temptation to just do the fun parts. But the speech recognition feature is not as good at teaching you to speak Spanish as a high quality audio series such as Pimsleur or LSLC. 

The advantage of the speech recognition is that you can slow down the word or phrase being spoken. So if you want to slow down the word "mujer" you can hear how the native speaker uses the hard H sound on the J and a slight roll on the last R; it's great for pronunciation but not effective for learning how to handle yourself in a conversation.

In summary, Rosetta Stone is not a one stop shop. It isn't as mobile as an audio series on your iPod. And it isn't going to make learning Spanish a thoughtless and easy task. I recommend that you buy this software and use it but understand that you are paying $500 primarily for word/picture association and the ability to analyze your pronunciation of individual words and phrases. Also, keep your Spanish dictionary handy to alleviate any confusion. The whole childlike learning approach is good, but your adult skills will definitely help to speed up the process.

As the editor of the Learning Spanish Products Reviews (LearningSpanishProductsReviews) site, one of my responsibilities is to review learning-Spanish software products that are listed on Amazon. I am also a native Spanish speaker and a professional Spanish instructor. 

Rosetta Stone Spanish is a great Learning Spanish product for a child or pre-teenager that wants to learn Spanish. This software features native speakers, real-life images, and a speech recognition feature. Your child or pre-teenager will find that this software is lots of fun. But the photographs do appear to be from at least two decades ago. 

I'd actually give this product 5 stars as a tool for teaching a child or pre-teenager Spanish. But as a learning-Spanish product for an adult the effectiveness of the product really depends on whether the adult is a visual learner or not. 

My advice is for you to also experiment with some of the auditory or auditory/text based comprehensive Spanish courses sold on Amazon, and decide if you are primarily a visual or auditory (or auditory/text) learner. Even if you determine that you learn better with or an auditory Spanish course you can still get good results with Rosetta Stone Spanish, by using it to complement your main auditory home-study Spanish course. You may also find the Rosetta Stone software helpful if you're an adult that has one or more of the major comprehensive auditory courses under your belt, and now you are merely seeking to expand your vocabulary.

I don't understand why testing for each language exercise is not the default selection instead of having to select it.  It is frustrating to go through an entire exercise hoping to see how well you did....and realize that you forgot to select "test" at the beginning.  Also, it seems that testing should be available for the 'guided exercise' also ...... not just the regular exercises.  Other than these two things, the program is very good

I recently purchased the anime studio 5 but not the
pro version, which costs 150 more and gives more functionality.

This is a fully functioning animation software, with lots of 
interesting features. I can see no reason that a novice
animator such as I am would not be happy with this software.

I would like to see more energy put into a manual, but you 
can scavenge the anime blog/chat site to find answers, or
google other places.  With a more robust manual, this would
be 5 stars, not 4.  It is really the reason I am reluctant
to upgrade to Pro, because I would want more lessons and
tutorials to go along with the upgrade. 

If you have an interest in animating, this is the software 
for you.

Turbo Tax Deluxe is an excellent product but they should make it easier for you to back up without having to go thorugh the whole category to get to one item.
Also they should make it easier to make adjustments to your state return. It's very annoying to find and adjust the State Return once you have gone back into your Federal Return.
I think it is a very good product BUT they should make it much easier to navigate to other areas ESPECIALLY for the STATE RETURN

This product did an excellent job of figuring our taxes.  This is the first time we've tried something like this and found it very easy to follow and complete.  You can go back and change things or review them, it gives you a way to e-file, you can print out all the copies that you may need.  I was surprised how easy it was to use.  However it took us a long time because we read all the items very carefully and double checked everything but it saved us a lot of money from what we used to pay our tax preparer.  I was very happy with it

My legal ofice bought this product specifically for making unfillable PDF forms fillable.  This feature works much better than we expected.  I anticipated we would have to do a lot of clean-up to make the forms useable.  That is not the case.  About 80% of the forms we run through it come out perfectly.  It seems to have trouble with forms that are really crowded with fields or have embedded fonts that we don't have access to.  Designing fillable forms from scratch used to take us hours for a simple form.  I could see most of the forms we use taking 6-8 hours each.  Running it through the FormTyper takes a few seconds.  The amount of time we save on this one task is tremendous.  We have also begin using the OCR capabilites to create digitial documents from our paper files.  The OCR seems to work really well, even with multi-generation copies.  We are very pleased with the performance of this product.

This software came with a scanner I recently purchased and I decided to upgrade from the "SE"(striped edition?)that was bundled with the device. Considering the cost and what the software can do it is an amazing value. By simply using this software to re-create documents instead of retyping them is saving me more an hour or two a day. I was hesitant to puchse it based upon all the recent negative reviews, but decided with the 30 day refund policy I could try it risk free. I'm glad I did. The software worked flawlessly for me - even on 5th and 6th generation copies that were hard to read with my naked eye 
(and I don't need or wear glasses). I'm not sure what those people that were scanning books were trying to accomplish, but when I scanned some pages from an encyclopedia for my son the OCR worked great!  Try it and if it doesn't work then return it.

I have been using OmniPage for several years at my law office and found that the OCR with this version is impeccable.  I frequently scan and OCR newspaper and magazine articles.  They are multi-column and the magazine articles typically have graphics and tables or charts.  When i convert them into Word documents I seldom get any formating errors.  In fact, because the OCR is so good I have set up a batch process to run at night to OCR all the day's work so my computer resoiurces aren't being taxed when I am in the office working.  Way to go Nuance

The very early years of optical character recognition (OCR) were quite the challenge.  Programs cost thousands of dollars, as did the scanners.  None of them worked very well.  It would take longer to "clean up" the document after scanning than it would for the secretary to have typed it in from scratch.  All of that has of course now changed, and Omnipage 15 Pro takes the art and craft to a new level.

I have been using the Omnipage product for the last seven years or so.  I use it my law office (along with a number of the other Scansoft, now Nuance, suite of products) on a daily basis, many times through out the day. We use it to chew up everything from court pleadings, to 100 page plus contracts, to real estate property descriptions, which must be accurate down to the comma and semicolon.  Our needs are fairly simple - get the text into the word processor so we can respond on behalf of our client as fast as possible. 

OP15Pro offers a significant performance increase over its predecessor version 14.  It is faster (very much faster) and more accurate.  Work flow is straight forward.  There is of course the ability to manually set or readjust recognition zones, recognize and format as spreadsheets.  This new version easily handles text in relation to graphic elements and does a good job of keeping them all together in their right places.  Like most everything else, and especially with computers and software, nothing is perfect and there are times that OP15 misses a mark.  It is however, for the most part, very accurate and efficient, but remember, the old rule of "garbage in equals garbage out" still applies.  We have recently started taking pen scanner images of documents in the books at the local registries of deeds.  These are 200 dpi scans of documents that themselves are old photocopies of text placed on paper with IBM Selectrics or worse.  In other words, stuff from the dark ages of the 1970's and before.  We were pleasantly surprised at how well OP15Pro performed. With these very old images there is a need to clean them up, but nowhere near what it used to be.

I will comment only briefly about the company's tech support.  There has always been enough information provided to get the software up and running. The key, of course, is to read and follow the directions.  A task that is sometimes difficult in this "I want it now world." 

The one "free call" is not just for installation problems, but can come months or even years after the product is purchased.  I have also found on occasion that tech support will often answer the simple and obvious questions without first asking for the credit card.  Solving technical problems can be frustrating and time consuming.  Considering what the software is attempting to do, there fact that it accomplishes it at all seems at times to be just short of a miracle. Lastly, the company's knowledge base is filled problem solving information.  There is also a tremendously large user base that supports the product through Usenet and other forums.

We have used ScanSoft/Nuance products for over five years - As a matter of fact I am writing this review using Dragon 8. OmniPage Pro 15 along with the PDF converter is by far the best on the market. The technical support has been fantastic throughout the years and the engineers always had open ears for recommended changes. OmniPage Pro 15 has saved me thousands of dollars because of its unbelievable OCR accuracy.  With a click and a choice I can now convert a PDF document into XL as spreadsheet.  Before this technology was created it was such a hassle. When I have to fill out a form OmniPage Pro 15 uses the saved information to help me. The program can run in the background and does not freeze or slow down my system.

If you're looking to create the next Doom 3 or Half-Life 2, then I can't really recommend this program. If you want to make an advanced FPS game, or a simple pong game, then I can recommend Dark Basic. In fact, Dark Basic Professional is probably capable of creating any kind of game that you can come up with. The catch? You have to program it yourself, all from scratch. Dark Basic makes manipulating 3D data extremely easy, but it's not a game creation package which lets you click and create. If you are determined enough, it's easy to learn all of Dark Basic's commands, as half of programming a game is in the logic. Dark Basic will hardly limit you, and will give you capabilities that were probably impossibly hard for you to use in C++. The end result of creating a game from scratch results in a tremendous sense of satisfaction, especially when you share it with friends and family. Although previous versions of Dark Basic Professional had some hardly crippling bugs, most of them have been eliminated, and with the release of upgrade 6.0, DBPro is a very stable development engine. Overall, I totally recommend this to anyone who wants to create a game, but is determined enough to learn how

I give the DB Pro 5 stars, but I am totally disappointed in Amazon.com and The Gamecreaters, heres why

The first thing I noticed is my box is different than that shown here... http://darkbasicpro.thegamecreators.com

I didnt recieve any of the free software stated in the link above

I cant find the 
Over 45 Demo's
Over 25 Tutorials
Over 600 Textures
Over 120 Sound Effects
900 3D Models 
That is stated here...
http://darkbasic.thegamecreators.com/

I applied the .59 upgrade patch and now my program wont start. It says its missing MSVCR71.dll file.

The original version was 1.05

I cant believe the darkbasic.com is advertising this product, yet Amazon.com is shipping some ancient version. Hopefully I will be able to resolve this issue..

Purchased this software to transfer files and operating system from on old laptop hard drive to a new one.  I put the new drive in a USB external case attached it to the laptop and ran the software.  In about 20 minutes and 3 mouse clicks the operation was completed and worked perfectly.  I have also used the software to image my hard drive as a backup.  

The menus are easy to use making all available tasks straight forward

You will probably read 50/50 from the reviews on this software.  Having used the older Poser software... One thing I am a fan of is Miki and Terai Yuki...Japanese virtual beauties and if you are a fan of Japanese styled video games and the character designs, the fact that e-frontier is now the company behind Poser 6, I'm so stoked.

Granted, the software with bundles (best to buy it bundled with other cool software), there is a free software out called Daz3D.  Daz3D content creators make stuff for Daz3D and Poser and vice versa but no matter if you go with the free program or Poser 6, the result will be the same...expect to pay money for content.

I highly recommend getting the book "Pratical Poser 6" because it's very, very informative unlike the manual. Next thing...before you buy...mosey down to daz3d.com, contentparadise.com, renderosity.com and ask yourself, can you afford to buy the content.  Content costs anywhere from free to over $100+.  

And the good stuff costs money...maybe not a lot but it does add up.  The next thing to know is that after you buy the content, due to how the hair or clothing conforms to the body (or how it's placed), they are not organized.  To make matters worse is that the names that the creators have called their work are long that the window for the selections (Figure, Pose, Hair, Prop, etc.) can get cut off and so, it becomes a bit of a choir to go back and forth to certain folders.

But I got used to it and the thing is ....all developers for the content are helpful.  Content Paradise is a great place to buy your content as well as from the creators websites as well.

There is a lot of trial and error and I wish there were more undos...because really, although there is an undo...you mess up...you can't just undo...you have to start over your from your save file (and hopefully you saved).  

Nevertheless, the stuff I was able to create in Poser is wonderful.  I will say that I have spent a lot not just on the Poser and the bundle but the content.  It adds up quickly!!!  So, consider the benefits for you.  Although I love the characters from Daz3D and the ever popular Foxhair,  I'm more a fan for Poser but still expect to be buying content from Dax3D for use of poser.

**things i liked about the program

it supports importing ojb files, that i make in different modeling programs

the walking path editor works not too bad for simulated walking

and the rigs have good looking emontions when you moves there face features


**what i found to be not so good

the tabs such as the library and keyframe bar are kind of hidden on the side because of his small they are.  

I find the slection tool in the hair room to be alittle bit annoying when trying to grow dynamic hair groups. i most of the time end up growing hair on too many facets.  

the control points are too senative, they end up twisting the body in un-natrual forms. 

the rendering takes a very long, and the rendering shader doesent always save my settings. i end up transporting the animation to another program to render faster. 

some of the cloths i cant set them up to be childern to the body parts so they end up not being connected to anything. 


i'm sure there more on my mind by i dont have much time to write up an review. just keep in mind 3d animation isnt perfectly easy. a good modeling programs to make OBJ files will go a long way.

I like the way the program goes through the tax forms as if you are interviewing with a tax preparer. However, I think it needs to do a better job of explaining why a tax form cannot be emailed and how to address that issue

I started off using Turbotax this year, but returned it to the store to use Taxcut instead. I purchased this version because it was a bargain, and it's easy enough to do state taxes by hand (or for free on the state website for those states that have that option).

I did have some difficulty with the update process, which was frustrating at first. However, I found Taxcut's website to be helpful on this point, and I determined that my firewall was the problem. I was able to update the product once I followed their instructions.

One key difference between Turbotax and Taxcut was that Taxcut is not integrated with as many companies. Whereas I could automatically download my W-2 and most of my 1099 forms into Turbotax, they needed to be manually entered with Taxcut. This wasn't a huge issue, but one difference people might want to know.

I completed and e-filed multiple federal returns, which worked great, and the e-file charge was reasonable ($15.95). However, I don't suggest having the e-file charge taken out of your refund. Apparently, there's an extra charge (I think $25) for this service. It's more efficient and less expensive to just pay the fee with a credit card.

Now to the software itself. I found it easy to navigate and enter information. I was a bit disappointed in the deduction section. Many of the fields were too short for me to enter complete names and addresses of charities, which I found frustrating. However, the calculations were accurate. I checked Taxcut's calculations regarding AMT, and they were excellent (Turbotax's calculations were wrong). In the second return I completed, the taxpayer was eligible for EIC, and Taxcut accurately identified this and did the proper calculations here as well.

Overall, I was very satisfied with the product, and will use it again next year. I will make suggestions to Taxcut, and hope they will improve their support for automatic download of forms and longer fields for charitable deductions. However, even without these changes, the product is an exceptional value

Purchased this edition of TaxCut last week.  On WIN XP2 the software installed cleanly and it downloaded the updates without any issues.  I imported last year's data in less than a minute and I had my return completed in less than 1 hour.  This includes capital gains/losses, dividends, and AMT calculations.  It doesn't get much easier than this.
Yes, you have to download updates.  The IRS is still making changes to the tax codes long after this software has to be packaged and sent to the stores.  The alternative would be to download the whole package online when you buy it, but wouldn't that take at least as long

It is a little bit clumsey. When I go to it, instead of my cursor being in the space where I write the word for a definition, I have to place it there and that takes time. The first one of these electronic dictionaries I had (about 5 years ago) was fabulous, it was called "deluxe" and had everything, but my computer outgrew ot amd the makers have never bothered to bring it up to date and offer it again.

ALso try the Medical dictionary.  It is as equally superb

Compared to FP 2000 and earlier versions, it offered some major improvements, even letting one code in (gasp) PHP with live preview - it is highly configurable, and easily tied into SharePoint (well, I think that was the intent).  

It was quite an evolution, moving beyond FP2000, with some fairly advanced features - while still retaining the "entry level, small business learnable" functionality (albeit cookie cutter designs) of previous versions.  

I was surprised to find it even offered options to strip out all code that hinted this site was made with FrontPage (an odd change, knowing MS), but also offered other code functions, some on par with Dreamweaver - but do not mistake this for Dreamweaver, even the first MX version.  It's still aimed at Microsoft only - you really have to dig and tweak to configure it for anything else (e.g, php, cold fusion) - but it does offer some major improvements for flexibility over previous versions.  Mostly good, some horribly bad.

The good - being able to tweak it to dozens of standards' compliance, Sec. 508, XML'ish stuff, whatever.  By default these things are not set up, so it does take some learning.  

What annoyed (and freaked me out) was that while it easily allowed for desktop development with Access, to create database driven sites - the database had to remain in a public folder - ok, I suppose if you're using it only on an intranet.  

I believe the point was to code with Access, then mod it slightly to interact with SQL server - but most folks probaby did not use it that way - knowing the history and "fire and forget" ease of use of FrontPage... 

Anyhow, I'd call this a para-professional version. It has way more flexibility and functionality than any version of Frontpage, ever.  It is also going bye-bye.  

There will not be a FrontPage 2007, due to the switch to Expression Web (which retains some FP functionality, but the "friendly" and pesky "bots" are gone).  No more email bots, whatever bots - gotta learn how to roll your own.

Frontpage 2003 is a great, easy-to-use WYSIWYG web builder.  Most hosting companies support Frontpage extensions, a set of web robots to help you build a dynamic site, similar to DHTML.

Two warnings, though:

1) This full version is too expensive; you may qualify to buy the half-priced Academic Version (search for "frontpage 2003 academic" on Amazon);

2) More important, though, Frontpage is being discontinued as a product altogether and will be replaced by Office SharePoint Designer (for businesses) and Expression Web (for everyone else).  You can download the latter for free (for now, at least) on MSFT's website

Given my limited knowledge of computer science and programming i felt FrontPage was a a really big help. I was able to get a website up and running in about 2 weeks which i think is pretty good all things considering. I didn't realize though that Frontpage isn't the cureall for making a website really. Primarily only for WEB DESIGN i.e. if you want to make a website with E-commerce and query searches of an inventory database and the like, you're gonna need to bring in the professional programmers in any event to program in ASP or PHP. But as far as Web Design goes Frontpage can take a novice a long way.

The hard-copy of Britannica has been the standard in reference for centuries, now you can have all of that, with video, audio, tons of photos, and extra support from the web for a fraction of the price of the original.  For what you get, it's an incredible deal and an indispensable part of any reference library

I trust the information I find from Britannica and so invested in the 2007 Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite.

It has something for everyone.

I use it side by side with Microsoft Encarta and together I get a more complete subject review.

I prefer the content of Britannica but for ease of use Encarta is still superior.


I look forward to Britannica making the interface and ease of use better in future productions and that is why I am only able to award 4 stars

If you want a simple to use program to manage personal finances Quicken is for you. I have found it very useful for keeping track of my checking and savings accounts. You can also make automatic posts to your accounts. Which is nice feature if you use automatic online bill pay with your bank. The program makes charts, graphs and reports showing where your money is going and coming from. It also does a nice job showing you if where you are meeting your budget and where you are spending too much money. Quicken makes keeps track of loans easy. It calculates how much money is going to interest and principle. I have been having a hard time and have been unsuccessful at setting up the program to track my 403B account. Overall, I think Quicken is a good program and recommend it to anyone to anyone who does not have a similar product already

I have used Quicken for over 12 years.  Whenever I got a new version, it always worked for me.  But, it has too many things on it that I don't need. I like to keep it more simple for me, so I just use the register, reconcile, reports, and lists-catagories. For all I use it for, I am happy with it
