Elegant yet tough, this particular Casio has a metal bracelet and is extremely comfortable to wear.  The display is sharp, clear, and very easy to read.  I only wish it had a thermometer.  The watch is big and looks very macho on your wrist

I wear this watch every day and I usually work outside. I am very pleased with the features and the durability. It seemed daunting to work the features at forst, but a short time with the instruction book made them accessable and easy.

I have only two complaints: One is that the metal band has developed a slight "squeak" when I move my wrist sometimes. The tin man needs oil. The second is that despite being placed by a huge window every night, the watch does not always get the time signal from Ft. Collins. I have gone as long as several days without getting it - but when you consider that most watches do not get it at all, I am OK with the spotty reception

I love this watch.  It has radio controlled time so it gives you exact time automatically.  Easy to read numerials. Watch is attactive.  The only down side is that it is a little bit on the heavy side.

The watch is solar powered and time is synchronized with an Atomic clock.  I'm not sure how that works (radio waves?) but the watch is extremely accurate.  The watch charges easily - put it under a light when you take it off- and it has a powersaving feature that kicks in when there is no light source (i.e. it's dark).  The buttons/settings work similarly to a battery powered G-shock but there is a little more complexity because you have to set your home city for the atomic clock sync to work right.  It's the first Casio I've owned with a metal band.  Unless you're a gorilla, You'll need to remove some links from the watch band.  I did this myself but you may want to take it to a jewelry store cause they have the right tools.  I love the watch.  It is everything you would expect from a G-Shock

You'll most likely have to get the links adjusted
</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
The strap/links on these G-Shocks are quite oversized: when I first got it, I could fit the watch around my legs! (You'll most likely have to get the links adjusted). Ironically, the four side buttons on the watch is small. So even if you have a huge wrist, you'll probably have trouble pressing the buttons! (Not for huge fingers) 

***BEWARE*** the picture shows the four side buttons on the watch in silver, but the left and right side buttons on this model is actually plain black! It is quite misleading! The silver side button is actually the MTG920DJ model (which is the 2005 version). According to Casio, the MTG920DA was actually released in 2004 with black side buttons. If you search the Casio website, it will only display the MTG920DJ (their most recent version); most websites that still sell the MTG920DA are just taking the latest MTG920DJ version picture from Casio's website. The MTG920DJ seems to have the same features as this one (MTG920DA), except the four side (left and right) buttons are in silver. 

For those of you wondering about the three circles on the watch: 
the first one on the very left is basically a wannabe-analog display - basically, every five minutes, a bar increases (or decreases when it gets full); it's just mostly there for cosmetic reasons. 

The second one in the middle is the battery status; it has an L (Low), M (Medium), and H (High) and the bar would display in one of those areas. If you get out in the sun a lot or know an area in your home where the sun shines a lot, then you won't have a problem with the battery ever going below High. Moreover, it has a power saving feature; the watch will go into sleep mode (display off) when it is in a completely dark area for a long time. 

Finally, the third circle on the very right is where it tells you what options are enabled/disabled. It shows SPL (split time for stopwatch), DST (Daylight Saving Time), SIG (Hourly Signal), ALM (Alarm), SNZ (Snooze), and Auto EL (Automatic Electro-Luminescent backlight - the backlight turns on by tilting it a certain degree towards your face without having to manually press the backlight button.) 

Keep in mind, synchronizing with the atomic signal is not instant: it usually takes around 3 minutes (at least for me, I live in California.) And if you're in a busy area or near an electronic, it might be difficult; try again or move to a different area. Moreover, it should show you the strength/level (4 levels) of the signal (while you're synchronizing) with a satellite icon on the watch. There is also a feature that automatically synchornizes for you while you're sleeping at 2:00AM, 3:00AM, 4:00AM, and 5:00AM. Therefore, it's not always necessary to syncronize it yourself because by the time you wake up, it should be ready to go. 

Overall, this watch is attractive and fun to wear. The atomic radio signal feature is very cool; having the official time is great - right to the precise second! I've had this watch for months now, and I enjoy wearing it daily. 

This watch does have a lot of feature - except, it's a pity it does ***NOT*** have a countdown timer! 

Pros: 
- Cool design 
- Water/scratch resistant; G-Shock are known for their toughest watches. (Update: I've worn this watch daily for almost a year and a half now and not a single scratch - still looks brand new!)
- Solar Power; battery life is excellent; never had the power ever go below High. Power Saving Feature. 
- Position of the time and date is easy to read at one glance. 
- Metal strap 
- Can display World Time with Local Time 

Cons: 
- The side buttons are small and tight to press (must use like the very tip of the fingers) 
- Atomic signal takes too long manually, and it usually is not possible to synchronize while wearing the watch; if you're inside the home, it is usually best to take off the watch and leave it near a window. 
- Alarm beep can be a little longer perhaps (even my inexpensive Timex Watch would beep and it would gradually beep faster, which I actually like a bit better.) 
- No countdown timer. (How could they forget this?!) 

Also, try to research other models instead of finding out the hard way (like I did about the side buttons) before purchasing.

She is unable to tell time yet, but she wanted a "Princess Watch"  to help her learn, and she was thrilled when she received it.  My daughter told me it was pretty and soft looking.  I insisted that the watch be one with hands, not digital.  So we all were happy and satisfied!  Ina Lan

I love knowing the exact time (even if my mom thinks I am crazy), and it works like a... clock! I never have issues with the updates (in Illinois), but I do have a few minor issues: the watch is too thick (5/8 inch), the band is made for a gorilla and is very difficult to adjust for a human, the buttons are hard to press, and the manual is too small and hard to read. Still, if I had a choice between this watch or my borhter's Rolex, I will take his Rolex and exchange it for 40 Casios. Thank you, Casio

I've owned several watches, including the older G-Shock and the Casio Men's G-Shock Atomic Solar Watch # GW1400DA-9AV (among others).

First, there are so many G-shock models to choose from. You could have bought the # GW1400DA-9AV (the stainless steel model) for the same price ($75) during the week of July 24, 2006.

This watch simply has everything one ever needs for time functionality: solar power (no need for daily rewinding, kinetic body movement, or batteries), synch with the atomic clock in Colorado (ultimate accuracy), time zone adjustment (ease for jet setters), light button (which also goes off when you tilt your wrist), stop watch functionalities, day/date functionalities, and countless other time-related functions. In this respect, it's much more functional than a Patek (even the complicated wrist watch models, or the more mundane Rolex, etc.). Of course, it's a lowly Casio, costing a mere $75 (vs. $75,000 for a low end complicated Patek)

Buyers should be aware that the watch is purtty bulky, probably 5/8 to 3/4 in. thick. One needs a sporty forearm/wrist to go with this watch.

For the fun of wearing it couple times a year, the price, and just to look at it as part of a collection of watches, I'd highly recommend it.

I live in eastern Pennsylvania, about 1600 - 1700 miles away from the atomic time signal station and this watch syncs fine right on my bureau, 4 feet from a window, and in a watch case.
When I received the watch, the battery indicator was on Medium, after about 30 minutes or less on a sunny windowsill, it achieved Full charge.
I'm quite pleased with it

I bought two of these for my twin two year old nephews who liked my watch.  They're too young to tell time but love the watches and asked to put them on in the mornings while I was visiting.  It has great features to help kids learn how to tell time and the watch is small enough for tiny wrists but with a face big enough for learning

I returned these, because they were too large for me. To be fair to Zina, they were as described, and I wasn't sure they would work. The only reason I'm not rating them a 5 is that, having returned them, I don't know how long the clasp would work.

I kept gold small hoops I bought at same time--very happy with them. Zina's  product descriptions are exceptionally good

I love the look and function of this watch BUT.....Guys if you have any hair on your wrists, be prepared to have it forcibly removed by the metal band.  I've had 3 other Fossil watches and never had this problem. I think Fossil needs to address the clearance between the links on this one. OUCH!

I got this watch one week ago. Its very good looking watch. Its $85 but looks like $150+ watch.
All of my friends are asking about this watch as it catches others eye very easily.
It upper dial (having number 05-15-25 etc.) rotates clock wise; this is a functionality to keep the time accurate while fast driving.
Its bit heavy, but now i am used to it.
I would recomend this watch to everyone who like heavy looking watches on their wrist

The earrings were very cute and the screw backs were definitely a good find. My daughter loved them so much she actually had them almost a whole month before she lost one.  But that is no bash on the earrings, the fact that she did not lose them the first week is a major accomplishment.

I would definitely buy them again.

I got these today and was so shocked when they arrived, wow, these are amazing hoops for 25 dollars. I am more than pleased, don't have an idea what some of the other reviewers were complaining about, I am floored at the price and the quality at the same time. With free shipping these are a must, great gift idea and everyday earrings. Amazon got them to me in a matter of 4 days and I'm in Hawaii, they also came beautifully packaged, I'm in love with them, don't let these sell out

I sent these for my cousin (who has everything!)on her 16th Birthday.  When i saw them later they were smaller than I expected----but she wears them everyday and they look very cute and understated.  They are a nice color and look better than cheap silver ones.  Plus if you are like my cousin and your ears get irritated with anything but gold--I would recommend these

This Invicta 2699 watch, it's a nice watch, the case of stainless steel, polished, looks very well, solid. with transparent case back, although there is nothing exceptional to look at.
Dial of mother of pearl, clear and clean, with not too many words or other dials on it, looks elegant, the Roman numbers are very good for that dial; the hands are big enough to be seen even in poor light conditions.
The movement is a Miyota automatic with 21 jewels, works fine, for the price.
It has poor power reserve, so if you do not use it for 24 hours, it will stop, nothing to worry about

These have quickly become my favorite pair of earrings.  They look substantial when worn, but they are lightweight and comfortable.  They go well with either silver or white gold necklaces.  They are shiny and have a classic appearance.  Plus the snap bar locks them securely in place.  Buy them and you won't be sorry!  They also make a great gift item

Silver Insanity continues to produce gorgeous items of Celtic jewellery.  The drop hook earrings come with nice size Faceted Oval Synthetic Amethyst Stones.  Very light weight.  Looks like you would pay 4-5 times the price.  Silver Insanity just delivers time after time

Quality of leather looks nice.  I can see what the other writer meant about the clasp coming off.  It's metal squeazed to leather and that's what I expected.  You just have to keep an eye on it and don't sleep or shower in it.  It looks nice

I was getting worried if it would arrive before my girlfriend went home for the holidays.  Then as promised it arrived today, last day in the estimated delivery window.  Hey its christmas I understand shipping sucks this time of year but I still would have been angry if it was late.
  Ok item itself looks great, I love the chain that came with it.  The box looks a little to cheesy on the outside to be romantic, but the wrapping was high class enough to make up for the box.  
  Im sure my girlfriend will love this, it will go great with her tattoo

My watch band was wider than the tool allowed, so I used a milling machine to  let it accept 1/8 " more. Ad should have stated how wide a band would work in this device. Otherwise worked well

This quote became my all-time favorite the first time I read it.  I was so delighted to find it on a piece of jewelry!  I had it on my &quot;wish-list&quot; for over a year -- this year my husband finally took the hint and bought it for me!  It's a beautiful piece, is very comfortable and is made of quality silver.  I highly recommend it for anyone who finds herself needing a boost of self-reliance throughout the day

I have been suffering from depression since I was 15 years old. My mother bought this bracelet for me at the age of 21 as a surprise (after some hinting; I was patiently waiting to buy it on my own!) I must say it is one of the most beautiful and meaningful gifts anyone has ever given to me. I don't believe I have taken it off for a single day in the several months I've owned it; it fits perfectly, matches everything and its beautiful message keeps me more centered and hopeful. It also keeps me feeling close to my mother while I'm away at college. She doesn't know it yet, but I hope to buy her the same bracelet for Christmas. It's a simply amazing gift for yourself or someone else

I purchased these at $16 in December 2006; they are currently running for $15, which is so worth it for 14K white gold earrings.  At this price you should be thinking about next year's Christmas presents.  Otherwise, if you are looking for a treat for yourself, you will not be disappointed.  The reason they lose a star with me is that for the 7mm size, the earring backs should be larger; they are on the small side

These earrings were a great value for the price!  They're small and delicate enough to wear out, but also look very polished for work.  I would recommend them to any and everyone

This is a great looking watch, and I like that it is lightweight.
I took it to the jeweler to have a few links removed. It's just techie enough for a geek like me (updates via satellite, days of the week in several languages, etc). Enjoy.

I was a little apprehensive about these Waveceptor watches after reading reviews for them.  Common complaints included scratches on the face, atomic synching problems, and difficulty setting up the watch for the first time.

I received my watch and it was in perfect condition, no scratches, light or otherwise.  It is light but the construction feels solid.  I was wondering what the initial setup was going to be like, since others had claimed it had taken hours(!!!).  It literally took me 15 seconds.  It involves holding a button down for 5 seconds, and pressing the other button a few times.  Once it was set up, the watch immediately synched itself to my local time with no problems at all  (I live in central Florida.)  I've only owned the watch for a day now and I must say I'm impressed with it so far.  I haven't experienced any troubles mentioned in the other reviews, and I'm very satisfied with my purchase.  Also, I chose the Super Saver shipping, Amazon told me it'd take 3 weeks to get it to me.  I received it in 4 days

  This watch is a high quality item for low money. You might think at first the color of the face is a little loud but you grow to like it, and as most of you know, if you have to grow to like something, you like it for a longer time than something that just "grabs you" quickly.
  It keeps perfect time at all times as it is updated with a signal from Fort Collins, Colorado every night. I would definately reccommend this item/brand for anyone looking for a watch

This is a great watch for my husband, Mike.  He has wanted a watch that he didn't have to worry about changing the time on all the time.  He travels often in his work.  I also has a nice lighted face which is easy for him to read.  Getting older posses some vision problems, so being able to read the time on your watch is a wonderful advantage.  He also likes that it is on atomic time and energy

In locker rooms and office corridors across this nations, a battle rages for the souls of men. Perhaps only the fratricidal dispute between boxers and briefs has more violently bloodied the masculine nose of our generation than this battle. Yet the jury remains out: wallet or money clip, what'll it be?

Lives and careers are savaged by a choice of one over the other, yet the passion that drives guys in the direction of the traditonal leather wallet or - alternatively - to the minimalist money clip continues unabated.

The Titanium Money Clip scores a victory for the latter. Small, lightweight, attractive, it cleans a hip pocket out, straightens the hang of the trouser, and facilitates the quick snatch of a bill when the wallet guys are still sorting through receipt they carelessly shoved in with their banknotes.

The only complaint regarding this product is that it requires five or six bills, minimum, before it has a sufficient wad to clasp firmly.

Other than that ... well ... I can't even remember where I tossed my wallet

Product matches expectations; no problems. Some other customers complained about how lightweight it is. To me it seems like what you should expect from titanium (after all, that's why they use it to make aircraft). The predictions of it getting sprung (losing its spring tension) were more of a legitimate concern to me, but I've had it for a month or two and it seems fine. It seems no more likely to do that than any other money clip, which is to say, maybe it eventually will, or maybe it won't, them's the risks of life. Go for it

I purchased these earrings for my infant daughter. Since most earrings are too large in my opinion for a 3 month old's ears, this was the perfect solution. As my daughter likes to lie on me when taking a short nap, the first earrings she had poked into me and it was uncomfortable for me. These are small enough not to bother me.
The prongs do cover a bit more of the diamond than is shown in the pictures, but they are still very cute. I also like the backs, as they screw on to the posts, and are nice and safe for baby's head

I purchased this item as a present for my friend and I. The piece is beautiful and is a great gift for anyone. I myself have the Yin half of the duo. The only problem is that the black paint in the Yin half is easily washed away. Now I don't mean that it all washes away but it does erode. The Yin looks a lot better with a little silver shining through the paint, however, but I do worry about all of the paint eventually going away. Other than that minor defect the necklaces are wonderfull. I'll definately be buying from this seller again

I didn't realize how picky my taste is with rings until I scoured Amazon for hours looking for something that would interest me.  This ring is one of the few I found, and I am far from a fan of having stones in my rings.  It has a nice low profile.  I've yet to have it catch on anything.  I'm also not a fan of open knot work on rings, but this again managed to sidestep that distaste.  The stone has no backing, so it gets an interesting red tinge in the middle, tinted by my finger

I read the reviews of the other buyers while I was purchasing ing this ring. The first review makes it sound mediocre while the other made it sound perfect. I promised myself I'd write a TRUE review of the ring once I recieved my own. The stone is neither large nor gawdy. The silver pattern is slighty thick for my tastes however not noticably thick. The stone is not high nor fake looking. The picture gives an acurate display of the product. All in all, it's a beautiful ring and a lovely buy for the price asked.

I bought these earrings for my 10-year old grandaughter for Christmas.  I think she has worn them everyday since - she loves them.  They are not large hoops; if fact, they are a bit small -- but perfect for her. For an adult, I think a little bit larger size would be better. All in all, I was very pleased with the earrings; the quality is very good.

This is so cute and if you are a pig collector you need to add him to your collection.  The blue eyes and rhinestone ears are what make it. Nice pink color, not too bright or too dull and so small, it's cute. The little compartment can fit a few rings or earrings in it. Very, very nice

Don't let the price of this cat necklace make you think it is tiny and almost invisible!!  It is a very good size and the carving is great!  It was so inexpensive that I bought two of them.  I'm thinking I might give one to my fellow cat lover friend!  GREAT ITEM WITH A GREAT PRICE!

I was impressed with the quality and detail of the ring. The person I bought it for loves it, and as a jeweler herself, that says alot. I was afraid of the metals when I bought it, but she has had no problems. Overall the ring is a gorgeous imitation of history and I would highly recommend it and the company I bought it from

This is a very grown up looking watch and my son who is seven, loved it, but it bothered him that it didn't fit very well. The velcro part didn't go very far so it was too big and we ended up putting this one away for maybe next year and buying another timex that was easier to adjust, which worked pretty well by the way.

We bought this watch for my 8-year old-- who loves it.  We deliberately wanted him to develop his time-telling skills (i.e., no digital watches please!), and have a "cool" watch, too.  The velcro strap, the second hand, water-resistant qualities ("I can wear it in the shower, Mom!"), and the indiglo face (very cool in movie theaters) made this a great buy.

The watch is very colorful. It is even safe to wear in the shower. However the watch cannot be read in the dark and the hands are even hard to see in daylight. It takes an extra few seconds to figure out wear the hands are. But adults who can't get enough of Harry should consider this watch

My husband likes watches and is a bit of a geek, so this was the perfect Christmas gift for him.  I was a little bit apprehensive when I recieved it but it works just like it should.  It is not apparent from the discription, but this watch does have the date feature.  I couldn't have gotten him a better gift for the price, he wears it every day

I bought this watch two months back and am using it as a casual watch. But it would go with a formal dress even. Works as promised; I have tried synching this watch in two countries, three signalling stations and several time zones, and it works perfectly well. To quote the cons, it IS a bit chunky, but that's ok since I'm using it as a casual watch. The back of the watch is plastic, which makes it look cheap but don't know if there is any specific reason for that. Also it would've gratified my every needs, had there been an 'Indiglo' or 'Nightglo' feature. In complete darkness, the irradiating hands look fine, but if it is half light, then I have to spend a second or two searching for the hands. These are minor things and I am a perfectionist, so here I stamp 4 stars on it.

I bought this as a gift for my husband. He loves it, it works great, looks great, and the price was awesome!

The bragging points of this watch are that the face is large, the numbers are easily readable, it keeps great time because it is atomic,  and the hands and numbers glow in the dark for nighttime viewing. 

The model we bought had a metal-link silver band, and I wish I could have bought the plastic/leather band, but it was not available at the time.  The silver band looks great and my husband liked it, but for work he has to have a non-metal band. We replaced the band with a plastic/rubber one, and the watch is still looking great, and my husband can use it for work or dressy situations!  

I can't believe the great price we got this watch for. It is really a perfect watch for men.

The watch has a nice weight, beautiful face and is generously sized.  I need to have several links removed before I can wear it.  It comes nicely packaged, although at first, I didn't think that instructions and warranty paperwork were included.  They were hidden inside the top of the watch box.  It was difficult at first to pull out the pin in order to set the time, but once I got the pin out, it was a snap to adjust the date and time.  

All in all, an excellent watch for a great price!

I've only had this watch for about a week, so can't really comment about the long term durability.  However, it is ultra cool watch.

Although I've not got a scale handy at the moment, but it seems to be lighter than my iPod Nano.  Really a featherweight watch, and therefore very comfortable to wear.  

The dial color really can't be adaquately captured in a picture.  It is VERY attractive, much more striking than the image indicates.  Several people have asked where I purchased it.

I'm very happy with this choice

This Skagen watch is full of class, yet it's perfect for casual wear too. Very thin, so it's not clunky like a lot of other watches. Titanium black... and the band is black metal as well. Had to bend the clasp a bit to get it to hold, but now it's perfect. And because it's not an expansion braclet, it's very easy to adjust the band to fit your wrist. I hope to have this for years to come, because I've not seen anything like it. And the price is right too

This watch is so light and thin but so good-looking that even my husband, who doesn't like watches weighing him down, wears it every day.  After three months I don't see any wearing away of the band and the face seems to really resist scratching, because it still looks perfect

Don't buy this watch, unless you want it (and your good taste) to be admired.  It's just beautiful, sort of like man-jewelry for guys that don't wear jewelry.

But I plan to wear it only when I wear certain clothing, to certain events.    I have other watches for other situations

I loved this watch the moment I put it on at Macy's.  I get home to see if I could maybe get a better deal than $135.  As always Amazon comes through yet again with a price of $69 plus I don't pay sales tax on it.  SOLD!  If you've not seen this watch in person the pictures definitely do not do it justice

This watch is for occasions only. you wear this one to weddings dance parties and or formal occassions. 1 you don't bring this to a fishing camp or use it climbing a rock face. 2 it's not a chonographic face so not for military so its not roughed enough to take out into the wilderness to go romping through with your M2A1 rifles. its sole perpuse is to get stares and look pretty on occasions like Birthday events. let your girlfriends buy it for you guys. I bought it because it was titanium mesh, not because of it's latching method. Again its almost 18th century... it's 21 century material used in place of a 18th Century design

I had been looking at the Skagen watches for six months and could not find any sales.  They are priced around $110.  When I saw this particular model for $69, I was excited.  I read some other reviews on other watches and was cautious when some said that they purchased watches that were not in boxes and had no instructions.  This watch arrived three days after I ordered it and was in a beautiful box just like I had bought at the store. It was brand new and I love it.  I especially love it when I get something new on sale and a great deal.  Amazon is a great place to order.  I get merchandise very quickly and at a great price

This necklace turned out to be a fantastic gift. She wears it everyday with every outfit. It looks great with jeans and a t-shirt AND with an extravagent dress.

This is a perfect anytime gift. I bought this for my gf for xmas and she loved it. We have only been dating for 6 months i did not want to get anything that was over the top.  Perfect for any occasion. She'll love it. 

This will wow her but not worry her to think you are rushing anything 


Plus it's under 100. Can't beat the price. Thanks amazon

I came across this looking for angel pendants.  I bought this one and the matching earrings.  I absolutely love this pendant! Wear it all the time and always get compliments on it.  You can wear it year round! One of the earrings fell out of my ear the first time I wore it!  Wouldn't recommend those! But this winged pendants is beautiful

I was pleased with this item. My only criticism is that it is smaller than it appears in the pictures, so I was decieved. I was hoping for a larger pendant.. However, my wife really likes it and it came with a nice little velvetine bag in which to store it....

These earrings are perfect! Perfect in size, color and weight. They're not much bigger then a quater and very light, in a beautiful white gold shine. Yes the post are thicker then most, but after a few days you get use to them. I had a pair like these that were given to me as a gift and I lost one. When I found these on Amazon I wasn't sure how much they would be like my other. They are a perfect match and my old pair was at least 7-8 years old. If you want a perfect hoop that is good for day or night these are the ones

I was hoping that they were a little larger in size and not as thick. However, I think it's a decent buy for only $30.00 I bought this as a stocking stuffer for my girlfriend. It comes packaged in a beautiful velvet blue box thats almost big enough to fit a watch. Very clean presentation when you open it up. The white gold really shines. The free shipping was FAST...and I do mean quick. I ordered this late at night and it arived the very next day. I've never had a quicker shipment for free before. If your looking for a great deal on white gold earings, I think you've found it

The picture for this pendant is deceiving; it is a lot smaller than it appears.  I know the dimensions were given but the picture gives one the impression that it is bigger than it really is.  Nevertheless, my wife likes it very much and that's good enough for me.  The price was right at $18.00 so overall I think it was a good buy.

Being part Irish and born 3 days after St Patricks day, hence my name I was lucky enough to find this item at Amazon.com and it is a top class item with a good finish. The ring seems to keep it's shine with no maintanence required. As usual the service and delivery at Amazon.com is second to none. As an American living in Australia there are so many things I can't get in this country which is why I get things like jewelry from them. Couldn't be happier with this ring

Loving the look of the Rolex Daytona, I spotted this watch on Amazon and just had to have one (at the price).
Arrived in a well padded display box, with all parts of the watch and strap covered in a protective plastic - so no scratches.
Taking out a few links for that custom fit just took a couple of minutes.
The watch looks great - better than the images on the Web - and it works as described.
Other posters that have had issues should read the manual! It does all of the chrono functions, and has full adjustments for hand alignment etc. - Fantastic

The Watch looks and feels great. I did a lot of looking around before I decided on this watch and I'm very happy with my choice!

I would recommend this watch to anyone who is in the market for a very good watch at an even better price.

Well done Invicta and Amazon on a great product

I sent this watch to my five-year old grandson as his birthday gift. He was very proud wearing it because the second hand had a soccer ball on it and the strap did not need adjusting. Besides, he started playing soccer at that time.

I am the type of person who has to have a watch on; I feel lost without it.  Therefore, my watch has to be something that I can wear every day.  But I also wanted something that can go with a dressier outfit.  And this watch is wonderful.  I've heard that Skagen is a good brand and it's true.  It's very lightweight, beautiful (I love the little crystals at each number), and durable.  Great buy

I bought this for almost 50% less than it sells in the local department store and am happy with my purchase.   The only trouble I have had is with the clasp.  It is a little tricky and you have to make sure that is catches correctly.  I found my watch on the floor recently because the clasp came open

It's not the most expensive watch but it doesn't have to be. It's a looker of a watch. Classy,clean and sharp looking. Mesh band on the wrist (any- I have a Skagen also) is most comfortable and easy to use and sure locking. Terrific buy & price

The watch is extremely reliable. I've had it three years and it's never lost time and is running on the original battery. I wear it every day so it takes a lot of abuse. It's simple design is elegant enough for me to wear to work or out for a casual evening, but casual enough for me to wear on weekends. The mesh band is the most comfortable band you will ever wear, you don't even feel it against your skin. I have a two-tone Movado and I far prefer my $89 Skagen to my $900 Movado.  My Skagen is also easy to read the time. I just love it more than I can say. I own numerous watches, many from Switzerland. But the Skagen is the KING of my lifetime watch collection. Simplicity as its very BEST

The learning curve on this watch if you use it for fishing may take some time.  The moon phase is nice to know about and the sunrise and sunset is pretty cool too, but I didn't give this watch 5 stars because for the money it didn't give me the one option I used more than any other on previous cheaper watches, a timer.  This one has the stopwatch but there is no timer you can set for say 10 or 15 minutes.  It keeps great time so far, but that's typical of Casio.  The backlight is very bright, enough so that you can almost use it as a flashlight, and the option on this model where you can set it for the backlight to come on everytime you hold your arm a certain way is cool.  If you're looking for a good water proof timepiece and you don't really care about the timer issue, this is the one.  And yeah I'm vain about what it looks like on my arm; it looks manly and cool

apart of great look and seem durability, it is strange feature in such kind of dial. You have chronograph, but you do not have idea where it stops. 23 or 26 seconds? Difficult to find out with such a dial..

even if you are not, buy this watch.  I am a nurse, much like many of the other reviewers.  In fact, I bought it due to their reviews.  It is a fantastic watch.  Easy to read, has an illumination option and a handy date feature.  The only trouble I have is the size of the band (too long).  I will take it to a jeweler to take a few links out, however, the directions for doing this yourself make it looks easy (it's not).  Don't even bother looking for another watch, this one is a steal

I was a little surprised at the size and weight of this watch, its almost 0.5in thick, and the bezel is a full 1.5in across so the case is a bit bigger than that.  The mineral glass crystal seems substantial and durable, but the clarity is just average.  In addition to having glow-in-the-dark markings (which don't work too well) on the hands and dial-markers, it also has an Indiglo style back-light (which does work well).  The bezel only rotates counter-clockwise, and it seems very tight at first.  Overall, it's a decent everyday watch.

The styling on this watch is very nice.  The silver and the grey colors look really good. The lightweight titanium is great and the size is just right. Now for what I don't like about it...first after purchasing online I took it to a jewelry store to have a couple of links taken out...I'm out $15 for that. The the clasp pin has broken twice another $20 for repair. And the watch is LOUD.  When I'm driving to work or am sitting in the office and everything is quiet I can hear the ticking....I don't guess that should bother me..but it does

I bought this watch because I wanted something inexpensive, but still professional looking.  I like the lightness of the watch, the thin size, and the simple design.  It does make an audible ticking sound that is louder than I would like, but still not very noticeable.  

If you haven't seen other comments about getting the watch sized, pay attention.  I took it to a professional jewelry repair shop, and they still couldn't remove some extra links without leaving some minor scratches.  I would recommend having any size adjustments done by a professional jeweler who has been selling this brand of watch for a while.  The jeweler I went to has a good reputation, but does not sell Skagen.

The Casio G-Shock Atomic Solar Watch #GW1400DA-4AV is sort of middle of the road in terms of price (I paid $99). It's not cheap but it's not too expensive either. The display diameter is not large but it is a thick, tough-looking watch (a real man's watch... :) ). It's also on the heavy side. So, if you're looking for an elegant, thin watch, look somewhere else.

When I first got it, the power source was at 50% charge. After leaving the watch on my desk facing up towards a desk fluorescent lamp that was left on, the charge reached 100% the next day. The solar cell seems to be working. The time is accurate too. I checked it against the computer time (which also gets synched everyday). It comes with a small manual (with very small text), but I found that there's really no need to use the manual at all initially. It works right out of the box and all the factory settings were correct. (The manual will come in useful when you have some time on your hands to browse through it to get a clearer idea of all the available features.)

The watch's steel wristband was much too large for me and I had to shorten it (removed 4 links, actually). I used a Swiss army knife blade to accomplish the task. The knife tip has to be strong enough to apply pressure to the spring loaded rod that holds the links together, but small to get into the small area between the wrist band metal links (watch for the arrows: these tell you where to apply the pressure). You need to push down on the ridges of the rod, and out (away from you). (Down, so that you can make the rod shorter, and out so that when the rod is shortened, the wrist band link will pop out). I did accidentally scratch the band but it wasn't too bad since the scratch was on the inside. (It's easy enough to shorten the wristband and almost everyone who gets this watch will have to do this.) Be careful not to slice your finger open. Always turn the blade away from your finger when applying the pressure.

Overall, I give it 2 thumbs up for looks and functionality.

(Note: this watch is sold by multiple vendors on Amazon. You should check for the one that has the best price. When I bought it, I wasn't aware of this but found out later, a little too late)

As other people have pointed out, this is a very solid watch. I really am not afraid of it breaking if it falls, or anything like that. However, this is partly due to its enormous thickness. It's not that the diameter of the watch is surprisingly large - it's how thick it is. If you have a small wrist, this watch is probably not for you, as it will be very noticeable. It's also not especially light, obviously, but it feels comfortable enough.

It keeps excellent time, and I've had no problems with the automatic signal searching

This watch is great. It recharges itself, self adjusts with the atomic clock, world time, auto lighting, etc... just to mention a few features. As this is from the G shock series, it is really sturdy and scratch/water/weather/heat/shock resistant! It has both the digital and the analog hand to view the time(whichever is convenient). This synchronizes with the atomic clock(time and the daylight savings) which means you need not adjust the time. Another interesting feature is that if you tilt your hand in the dark towards you then the watch lights up showing you the time!

There are a few cons. There is no seconds hand on it(but there is a digital second indicator). This watch is slightly heavy and huge. But after a few months you get adjusted to it. You need to go through the manual as there are so many features and you have only four buttons

this is a very nice, affordable watch.  i like not having to replace batteries and knowing that it will ALWAYS be accurate.

people who own $1000+ watches ask me about it a lot.  when i tell them that it is solar powered and automatically synchronizes with an atomic clock every night, and that i only paid $60 for it while on sale from amazon, they immediately tell me that they paid too much for their expensive inferior watches

It's a very stylish watch and I get compliments on it all the time, but the display for the functions like stopwatch, alarm, and date display are small and hard to see. Also, the date is off and I haven't been able to properly set it

I bought this watch as a gift for a friend who requested this exact one.  He loves it.   Personally the lights that come on and off far too frequently for no reason would be a little too much for me.  It is certainly the largest wrist watch I have come across but if this is what you're looking for and knowing that it is a G-Shock which makes it a great watch, this is the one for you

The watch is an excellent timekeeper.  Automatic calibration really works (although some reviews I'd read indicate otherwise).  I like the dial, features, (changes to dst, calendar knows how many days in a month,etc.)   Do not, though, travel with this watch for a while without the instruction book.   The four control buttons take some time to figure out, and most of them are so rarely used that when you do need the stopwatch, or one of the various other options, you'll likely need the book (at least I did).  Also understand that this is a BIG watch--probably at least twice as thick as the watch you're used to and considerably heavier.  It will hang up on a jacket or anything with long sleeves.   The G shock, though, is tougher than a hammer and if you don't mind the bulk I'd recommend it.  RLM in Iow

I've seen very inconsistant reviews for Silver Insanity items.  I received this necklace for Christmas last year, and it's pretty nice.  Generally I always receive a compliment when I wear it.  For the price, it's worth it. If you're looking for something nicer, you're simply going to have to pay more

I bought this watch for my husband and he absolutely loves it.  He has received many compliments.  It is high quality and arrived in perfect condition.  It is great as an everyday watch and still nice enough to wear for dressier occasions as well.  Almost bought the watch at a dept. store, but saved $25 using amazon.  Great product!

I recieved this watch for Christmas and I'm still blown away looking at it.  Had to take it to a jewelry shop to remove a link (my wrists are small) because the links are difficult to do themselves, but that's probably just for emphasis on quality.  It came in a Fossil christmas tin, very well packaged.  I'm very satisfied and recommend it for someone looking for a nice dress watch for their collection

Recently I got into a more "grown up" field (commercial real estate) and decided I had to look the part.  I decided I needed a great watch to go with those new Brooks Brothers suits and got an Invicta Speedway.  At over a little more than a hundred bucks it was the greatest deal of my life.  I get compliments on it, especially from women, almost EVERY SINGLE DAY.  Several of my older colleagues mistook it for a Rolex Daytona and flipped when I told them the price.  I highly recommend it.

Furthormore,  I have found that INVICTA is an amazing watch company to say the least.  Around the same time I also bought the 8926 Pro Diver to use as my casual watch and also get endless compliments.  It is amazing that I got both of these watches for less money than a run of the mill Seiko or Citizen.  They will have have my money and compliments for years to come

It's a great watch for the price.  I think I paid $130 for it. It runs great, keeps good time, and is probably one of the best watches you can get for the money.  High quality work, very close in look/feel/weight to a R*lex.  We'll have to see how the gold plating wears over time, but other than that, it's a great watch

Believe it, this is a stunningly beautiful watch and no one will guess the price unless you tell them.  It gets more attention than my gold Rolex!

As for the weight, it is normal for stainless which means a solid feel and you know it's there.  If someone wants a flyweight watch why would they buy stainless steel?

It reliably functions exactly as described.  You'll love this watch.  Buy the 5-year extended warranty for $25 and enjoy it.

P.S.  If you need to remove links, just put a smoothed paperclip in a vice to push the pins out.  No big deal

The watch was even more attractive than it appeared. I had none of the noise problems that were described in other reviews. The mesh bracelet is not as comfortable as the leather bands I am used to. In low light it is sometimes difficult to see (my eyesight is good). But basically I am very satisfied

I read the reviews on this diamond just before Christmas when it was on sale for $99.00. The diamonds are better then expected and I consider them to be a fine purchase for 99 bucks. No visible flaws. I am sure if I used a loop I could find some but no visible yellow on these and the clarity is fair. Their great for $99.00 diamonds

My friends purchased this watch for me in 1998 as a graduating college/leaving for the Army gift.  I have worn it daily for nine years.  It survived the hardships of an Army lifestyle (I wore it daily then, too) and is still going strong.  I have replaced the battery once and had to have the date bezel removed (the thin silver border) because it popped out after my toddler daughter beat on it on the ground various times (yes, I should have moved it to a higher location).  The lens has minor scratches, but nothing that deters from its simple function and aesthetic charm.  This watch has never failed me.  It is simply the best, most durable, watch that I have ever owned

Very handsome easy-to-read face and date window; especially like the day/date display. Most watches in this price range feature date only. Excellent value

I'm a pretty big guy so it doesn't look out of place, but this is really an extra large watch that is also quite heavy.  It runs well, keeps good time and the movement has a very good reputation for reliability.  If you're an extra large person and don't mind a heavy watch, you may be interested in this.  If you're average size or smaller, I wouldn't recommend it.  Personally, this is my weekend watch because it comes across as being pretty bullet-proof in normal use

Yeah, it's a money clip alright.  Going from an overfilled wallet down to a 5 card/cash only clip was surprisingly easy.  I found that I was carrying a whole lot of "stuff" in my wallet that I didn't need and was just causing my wallet to get bigger and bigger.

With just 5 cards, a couple receipts and a little cash this clip is much more comfortable, easier to manage, and looks a lot better than my old wallet.

I do agree with the previous reviewer about the clip forcing the cash to bunch up under the clasp when it's closed.  However, it doesn't take long for it to become second nature to keep the cash pulled out a bit before securing it down.

I haven't used any other money clips so I can't compare this one to others, but if you use a wallet I can say that this is, hands down, my new preference

I've had this for a week, it may not function as well in a year, and that is something you might want to keep in mind reading this.

So far, however, it's been a great replacement for a wallet. Don't get me wrong, I still have my wallet and will likely use it when travelling. But for everyday use this is far more practical and comfortable to carry. It's also as easy on the eyes as it is in the pocket - equally pleasant to carry and look at.

Feels sturdy and durable; light but not flimsy. This can hold upto 5 cards and maybe 20 bill notes.

Be warned, however, although the clip does hold 5 credit card-sized cards (ID's, and whatever else you may have) it is only really easy to remove the topmost and bottom most cards. That is, if you have 5 cards you use quite often you may want to look else where.

Personally, I have an ID on the top and my credit card on the bottom. The other three cards are ones I almost never use, or use very rarely.

One of the concerns I had purchasing this is whether or not it will securly hold less than 5 cards. It does (there are pressure clips on the sides of where the card goes in), but I wouldn't recommend it. Just didn't feel safe enough, even with 4 cards.

Something I did not foresee purchasing this is that the clip secures the money very tightly. Consequently: 1) When you press down the clip, it drags the money back a few millimeters. If you put the money in too far back it'll crumple it up. 2) When secured, you can't just pull out a bill, you will have to lift the clip up. The first point I've found a little more bothersome than the second, but after playing around with it for half an hour or so I've got the hang of clamping it without crumpling the money.

That being said, it really is a very nice item and would be an awesome gift to give to a friend, husband, father, or for your own personal use - if it suites their or your dress style.

(If you are wondering why it is a 4 star and not a 5... well, for no real good reason. It does deserve 5 stars, but the little issues with the clip tugging on the money as you clamp it down - although it means money is held more securely - that holding less than 5 cards didn't feel too secure, and pulling out any card other than the top and bottom most cards is difficult, dropped it down to a 4. It may just be that these are issues that were neccessary to keep the product as fanatastic as it is. 4.5 stars might have been a welcome option, this is as close to perfect as it gets.

  I just recently had my ears pierced and needed something small that I could wear continually on a daily casual basis without the earrings looking too dressy.  These earrings are just perfect for that purpose.   They are simple elegance with genuine pearls and sterling silver findings.  They are even confortable enough to wear while sleeping. I am wearing the white pearl set right now.  Love them!

These earrings are really pretty.  There are not real great variations in the color between each set (they are all pastel, after all!) but each has a beautiful sheen and color.

They are also set very firmly on the backs - I was worried that, for the price, they wouldn't hold up.  But they are very nicely made.

The packaging was okay, but not deluxe.  What I appreciated was that there was a little flyer enclosed telling how to take care of pearls, which I found informative.

All in all a good purchase and well worth the money

I am very pleased with the pretty shades of the pearls and the size was even bigger than I expected.  The only thing that would have them even better was bigger flat backings.  I have very small ear lobes so they flopped forward.  I remedied that by changing the backings.  I am wearing them with so many things and really enjoying them

As with all natural pearls, the shapes are not perfect. Only cultured pearls are perfect, because man controls them. The dye is uniform and the size is perfect, big enough that they can be seen easily.  The colors; pink, white, gold, and lavender are clear.  Even the green is a clear green, just not my favorite green

I was skeptical about this watch because of the very low price but I was very pleasantly surprised. It has a quality finish and band, is comfortable, and works great here on the East Coast. It reliably synchs with the Colorado time signal so it's always accurate. Great watch for the money, I highly recommend this yellow dial watch and its black and blue dial siblings

I purchased one of the Casio Men's Atomic Waveceptor Yellow Dial Watch #VQ200HDA-9BVCF from amazon. This watch is great, it updates the time automatically (just switched to daylight savings and I didn't have to touch a thing).Instructions say to position watch in a window or where it has view to the sky for updates, My watch was in a drawer under a marble top and it updated just fine.I saw in other reviews complaints about the plastic back, this is a must to allow the auto updates. Again, Cool Looking,Great Watch!!!!

This watch is pretty much exactly what you would expect from the picture. The case is a bit thick and the backplate is plastic, but that might reduce overall weight and compensate for the size. It certainly doesn't feel like the lead weight my fossil watches seem to be. I have a smaller than average wrist and it was easily sizable down with the proper tools. Atomic time reception is good even as far south as I am and it rarely misses updates. You can force an update if you feel like it and its really easy.  What is not easy is the initial setup.  I've never had to really read a manual on most electronics, but you will need it with this one.  Keep that in a safe place for when the battery dies.  At least for now, the price is a deal for the functionality and quality

I used this necklace as a matching piece to my fiance's marquise heavy engagment ring. It is a beautiful contemporary piece of jewelry. It's symmetry and simplicity are hard to find in sea of gawdy overly embellished jewelry pieces. It's a great buy and my fiance loves it

The photo of the necklace looked pretty, but I didn't realize it would be so nice!  My daughter loved it and I will probably purchase one for myself

This pendant is much prettier in person.  It's got a nice polished finish, not satin/matte like in the image.  It hangs nicely on the sturdy snake chain.  I've already received several compliments on it.

Hello all, you cannot go wrong with this watch. It is a very good looking watch. The web does it no justice. Great Deal for the money. This is the most expensive watch I have ever had, I have always worn Timex, but no more. The features in the Perpetual Calendar and the Kinetic and it also has a Leap Year Calendar, which I did not need, but no problem. If the watch sets still for more than 12 hours it actually stops. Then the moment you pick it back up it automatically reset's itself, pretty cool feature. When I received it, the watch blew me away. It was delivered quickly and tags were attached and I registered it with [....................]. I can go on........I give it 10 stars if it would let me!!!!! Enjoy.

I love this watch, I've had it for almost a year.  Its absolutely beautiful, but simple. It keeps time very well.  For the work I do I don't wear this watch to work.  So I can go sometimes a full week without wearing it.  The hands stop after sitting still for 24 hours but as soon as I pick it back up and give it a shake, the hands spin around and sets itself.  Its not to dressy for casual wear, but it also fits perfectly with a suit and tie. I highly recommend it!

I bought this watch as a gift for my boyfriend, and he was pleasantly surprised to say the least.  The human-powered kinetic movement of the watch really appeals to the gadget lover in any guy, and the sapphire crystal face of the watch will not scratch.  Although I bought the black-faced Kinetic Coutoura Seiko, the gold/silver version of this watch is lovely also.  Great quality, gorgeous appearance, reasonable price - definitely consider this watch

First impressions: It's a nice watch with a clear look. I was a little worried about the lack of backlighting, but was pleasantly suprised that I was able to see the luminescent dials clearly at any hour of the night.

Pros: Quick atomic time synchronization (usually within one to two minutes after the initial synchronization). Simple to use. 

Cons: Case is described as stainless steel, but back piece is plastic. Originally listed by Amazon as a solar-powered watch, but instead powered by regular battery. Battery life expectancy about 2 years, though it may lost longer by disabling the auto-sync feature.

Overall comments: This is my first atomic time wrist-watch. It automatically synchronizes with atomic time once at midnight (a function you can disable if desired) or on-demand with the press of a button or two. It does this by scanning for a radio signal. According to the instructions, you're supposed to leave this watch near a window with the 6-o'clock side facing the window for best radio-signal reception. Reception can of course vary depending on your location, but the watch has successfully updated several times even while I was wearing it.
I like watches with flat crystal surfaces, because it allows me to paste a PDA screen-proctector (cut to size, of course) on them, which keeps the crystal from scratching. The crystal on this watch is only slightly curved, and in only one direction, meaning a screen protector sticks nicely and evenly to it.
The watch is waterproof to 50 meters, which (in Casio terms) means you can go swimming with it, but you should not press any buttons underwater. I try to keep my watches away from water when I can, but it's always good to know that it should survive most water-related mishaps

I received a lovely pendant necklace several years ago, and wear it everywhere, but my long hair always tangles in the chain and trying to get the hair out usually breaks the chain.  I average buying about 4 new chains a year.  Since purchasing this chain, my hair is not tangled nor ripped out by the links, clothing fiber doesn't catch on it, my pendant does not get stuck on the clasp-in short, this is the worlds most perfect chain!  I cannot tell you how happy I am with this purchase

The watch was shipped in a timely manner, actually I receive the watch a few days sooner than the expected delivery date. I purchased this product as a gift for my son.  When I opened the package it was everything the site said it would be and more. My son and I am very pleased with the watch. I do agree with a previous review stating that this watch is not for a small frame man. Although, this is not a problem for me because my son likes the larger watches, I took it to have it resized for him and it fits perfect

This is a great and stylish watch.  I always get compliments.  It is heavy, sturdy and looks much more expensive than what the actual price was.  It looks great with any suit and looks really good with a nice blue shirt.  Highly recommended.  The stainless steel is much shinnier than what the picture shows.  Ignore the comment below.  You will be happy with this watch!

Had these on my wish list and received them as a gift. They are even more lovely in person. They are one of my favorite pairs - I wear them all the time. They're very simple, yet elegant, and very well made, especially for the price. I will definitely buy more from this company.

I first came across the Silver Insanity line of Celtic jewelry last year, when I was looking for Christmas presents. Jackpot! I confess I spent a good hour and a half looking over their featured items, both on Amazon and on the Silver Insanity website. The teardrop earrings I picked out were quite a success, so much so that I recently went back and got this lovely pair of silver Celtic knot earrings for myself. I've been very happy with my selection, and I just went to pick out some silver starburst earrings as a wedding gift for a friend. I highly recommend the items from Silver Insanity, and plan to order from them again

Having only owned Fossil watches prior to this one I must say that I was a little jaded.  My latest Fossil bit the dust after many long, good years of use.  I happened to find this just browsing one day and was hooked by the color and overall design.  I have to say, I was highly impressed with what I received.  It is an absolutely beautiful watch

Lovely jewelry, great price, but the clasp is pretty tough to work. This is not the necklace for anyone with stiff fingers. I'm also worried that the clasp might not hold up to repeated use and wish it was the more traditional link to link closure than this insert-key type clasp. It's probably a great choice for very occassional use, though with the quality and price, it really is a regular-use type of necklace. I think it's best suited for the nimble-fingered, traditional-fashion person

I had always assumed that freshwater pearls were oddly shaped and not as attractive as their saltwater cousins. This set put my assumptions to rest.  It is a beautiful set of pearls at a very competetive price

If you are trying to buy a decent set of pearls and don't really have a good frame of referance - these are for you. My wife was a jewler and she likes pearls. I bought these and got positive feedback. I was nervous but when they showed they were heavy and looked great. You will be OK if you go with these

I ordered this jewelry piece with the gift box and card.  The box, while attractive at first glance, is flimsy, got slightly crushed in transit, and the ribbon on its top is frayed and pasted-on.  The card that came with it is much too large to fit inside the box or even on top gracefully, and the message inside is not centered, making it impossible to trim down.  Said message inside appears to have been written in plain old Times New Roman script.  I could do far better on my own printer, and for the cost, I could get a much more attractive card at a store.  I will say, however, that the piece itself looks every bit as nice as it does in the photos.  I might order from Silver Insanity again, but I'm not paying for any of the "frills"- they just aren't putting enough work into it to make it worth it

These are beautiful earrings.  They are a bit small but the stones are vibrant and rich looking.  My only complaint is that the post part of the earring is not very substantial and I feel as though I need to handle them VERY carefully.  They are extremely comfortable and have just the right amount of movement to them.

I received these earrings today and am delighted with them.  I read the reviews carefully, so I knew the actual size of this item, and the only surprise was how exquisite these little earrings are.  The presentation (bag and box) is beautiful -- looks like materials you would be given in a traditional jewelry store.  I've posted a couple photos in customer images so you can better visualize the size and see what the earrings are housed in

Paid $45 for these and worth every penny.  They are delicate, the color is brilliant, the stones are very clear.  I wore them to work as soon as I got them and received more than a few compliments on them.  They would make a wonderful gift for someone, and even better for yourself

The bracelet didn't look as I expected from looking at the picture, but is very pretty.  I didn't realize it would be so delicate-looking, because there is nothing to compare it to in the image.  It is very nice, though.  It is small/thin, the kind of thing you might wear with a dress, yet seems strong.  The metalwork seems done well and I think it's a bracelet that would be right for wearing someplace special

I bought this for my sister for Christmas.  I have a similar one that is bigger, that I bought while in Charleston, SC.  She fell in love with mine, and since driving 4 hours just to buy a necklace was out of the question, I decided on this one.  At first, when it arrived, I thought it would be too small, but my sister does not wear large neclaces, earrings, etc... Turns out she loved it.  It was just perfect for her, especially since her neck is thin and her complexion is olive

The 18" description is for the necklace on it's longest extended setting.  Without using the extended part of the chain it is really closer to being child sized.  It is pretty and will end up being a gift for my daughter rather than the friend I had intended to give it to

I received this pair of hoop earrings as a Christmas gift from my boyfriend.  When I first open the box, I thought they were earrings for an infant.  The earrings are very very small; however, they are cute.  As I started wearing the earrings, I began to really like them.  They are the smallest pair of earrings in my possession.  If you really like dainty jewelry, I highly recommend this item

I received this watch yesterday and would like to counter some comments in other reviews. The watch I received has no scratches on the crystal. It was packaged nicely. It does not seem too thick. It does not appear cheap or lightweight. Although the back plate and two buttons are plastic, the rest of the watch is sturdy metal, and it feels solid. The wristband is just the right size for me, although I do have a gorilla wrist. I didn't find the manual difficult to understand. The watch attempted to auto-sync overnight, but didn't get a signal, so I manually sync'ed it the next day according to the instructions with no problem. Easy-to-read dial, low price (about $35), overall a great atomic watch worth twice what I paid

Nice watch that keeps super accurate time. However, it is very basic showing only the time and date. It would be nice if it had backlighting, but the hands do glow in the dark for some period of time. It is a little tricky to pick up the time signal so I would recommend finding a place in your home where the signal is strong and leave it there every night.

I ordered these earrings a little over two months ago and I am very happy with them. They are very light weight and they do not pull on your ears. The size is perfect; very "in" right now. You do have to pull on the stem pretty hard to get them off because the clasp is very tight. However, so far, so good. They have not broken and the clasp has not become loose or anything. I even accidentally left them in a pocket once and they were put through the washing machine. They were completely fine afterward. I do wish the earrings had been about $20 less expensive. But, overall I love my earrings

I have had this watch for more than 5 years, and wear it daily. I purchased it in Cayman Is, and I think I paid a lot more than the Amazon price.

I love the Eco-Drive, as it never needs attention. About a year ago, the Eco-Drive mechanism went bad, and I sent it to Citizen. They replaced the mechanism for free, saying it was their issue. Kudos to them on that.

I have been able to scratch the crystal, but only after heavy abuse :) The number band around the outside still turns as well as the day I bought it. The numbers on the metallic band around the face have never worn off, but the outside of the band has a nice smooth edge to it now. 

The lettering wore off the band after about a year, so if you plan to use the dive table that is on the band, don't wear it daily. Else, be smart and carry your own dive table on the old plastic card or on your dive computer. 

The band has now finally worn out after 5 years (which is how I ended up here). The two small strap holders just broke off in the past 2 weeks (they wore through), and the band is cracking but only in the holes (still holds just fine). 

I would buy this watch again, and obviously recommend it.

I have owned this watch for almost 4 years now with absolutely no complaints.  After going through several cheaper watches to wear at work and on a casual basis I decided to spend a few extra bucks to see if I could get more wear out of one and I am sold on this one.  I work in a facility that deals with chemicals that are hard on watches and I also work with mechanical equipment that is hard on crystals and this watch has held up in my working environment quite well. Because I am not a diver, I am not sure that this is a good diving watch but I do fish and play in the Atlantic and this watch has held up through use in the sand and salt with very little care given to it.  I am still on my first band and battery and the watch still keeps accurate time.  The band is starting to crack a bit but, after what I've put this watch through, I am surprised it has held up this long.  The crystal is a tad bit scratched but the other watches that I have had would have blown apart or would at least be cloudy from the blows that it's taken

The first watch had a broken crown the date could not be changed.To amazons credit,they sent me a new one right away.This watch is fine.I needed a rubber band because I am in water a great deal of the time at workand I live near the ocean.I am always in the water with my children.So far the watch is great and has held up to expectations.No problems except when the first one was shipped broken.I would buy it again

I love the look of this watch!  I have enjoyed it for almost two weeks now and it has kept perfect time to date.

Originally I was attracted to the Seiko SKX173 which I came across first.  However I was concerned that the physical size of the Seiko might be too large for my wrist plus reviews indicated its automatic/mechanical movement might not be as accurate as I wanted. 

Later I found this Citizen watch which looks virtually identical, yet it is smaller (diameter 38mm vs 43, height 10.5mm vs 13.5), and has a more accurate battery-driven quartz movement.

It also has a longer warranty (5 years vs 3) which probably indicates that the movement is more likely to be trouble-free than the self-winding Seiko.

The only negative I have encountered is that it (as well as the Seiko) come with a fairly bulky rubber strap.  While this is more comfortable than I expected, it does tend to interfere somewhat with the drape of the cuff when wearing a long sleeve shirt.

I wanted to buy a claddagh ring for my son - and came upon this ring.  When it arrived, I really was in awe of just how beautiful it is!  It is a larger, more bold ring - definitely more masculine.  This is a gorgeous gift for someone looking to buy a quality piece of jewelry for someone they love.
It's too bad that the ring will eventually be outgrown because my boy is only 12. Hopefully I can have it resized later or find another one that is this nice

Sounds a little strange, but I needed another digital watch just to have a hourly chime, so that I could do hourly "reality checks" that make it possible for you to have lucid dreams. Ok, nevermind. Check out Stephen Laberge's books for more on that.

I've had it for only a couple of weeks - bought it at a certain nationwide store that has a crosshair symbol as the emblem -  and then accidentally saw this page on Amazon, so I thought I'd review it.  

It's very comfortable as another review said. 
It looks great.  At first, I was a little self conscious about wearing this big thing when I first got it home and tried it on, but come to think of it, it's not that much bigger than my Seiko diver's

I'd highly recommend it. Defintely happy with it, even though I won't be using most of the many features on it

My boyfriend found this watch at a retail store & put it on his Christmas list.  I purchased it at Amazon at a much better price.  This was a replacement watch for an old Timex watch.  My boyfriend says he loves this watch - no complaints at all.  He says the buttons are easier to push than those on his old watch & he especially likes the large, easy to read display.

Amazon shipped the watch very quickly, it arrived two days before they said it would and I was very happy with the weight and styling of the watch.  "A good purchase" I think to myself.  The only piece of styling I was not happy about was the large magnifier above the date on the watch, which is not visible on the amazon photos. When I pulled out the crown to set the time and date I got that sinking feeling that something wasnt right, and that feeling was followed by the whole crown comming out of the watch.  I was able to put it back in and set the time, but setting the date was not possible.  I used Amazons online return procedure, filling out an HTML entry field box about the problem and printed out postage and a barcode to put in the box.  I took it to the post office and the shipping was free, although the post office was not able to insure the shipment which kind of worried me.  That was 4 days ago and I still havent heard anything from amazon about the return, although they did say expect 5-9 days to process returns.  I hope it all goes well and I get a replacent watch.  I did read about this same problem on other Amazon reviews for similar watches by Invicta, so it is worth looking into before purchasing.

I ordered these for my 18 month old daughter, and was a little nervous, I had never bought earrings on line before, I wanted something with the safety backs, but I had expereince with some backs that "screw themselves off".  I loved the butterflies and wanted to try them!  My daughter has had them in her ears for a few weeks now and we haven't had any problems!  I keep checking the backs and they are on nice and tight.  I wanted a good quality earring so she didn't have problems with infections...and we havent!  I will definately order from here again

Sometimes, you realize you need a watch but don't want to spend a fortune, something that'll last long, is solid, yet fashionable and easy to use. This watch has it all, many times girls have stopped me to see this watch, it is sophisticated, stylish, and only $85 no matter where you go. The metal stays shiny, the glass, virtually scratch proof. Days of the week, military time, day of month (problem with this is it does not know, if month is 30 days or 31, so u have to set it yourself sometimes, but rarely, and worth the effort) I highly reccomend this watch to everyone

I bought this at a fossil store for $85, and its worth every cent. It has the time, day of week, date, and military time. Its waterproof up to 100 meters. It has a double lock to stay on your arm. It is glow in the dark. It has a spinning number thing. It looks good and is always shinny. its only 85 bucks. ITS PERFECT!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I bought this set for my wife as a valentine's day gift. She really liked them! They are a good size and color, so they give a striking impression from a distance. The earrings come in little plastic ziplock bags all packed inside a not too special velvety bag. If you purchase this as a gift, go the extra step and get something to make a better presentation. I went to wally-world and bought a $3 wooden jewelry box, which conveniently enough had a heart-shaped decorative glass in the top. It was well received.

  This is not the first tool I'ld add to my work bench, but it has some pieces I'm glad to have.  I re-sized my watch band in just a few minutes and only had one little incident with doing something the wrong way.  Did I mention that the instructions are somewhat lacking?  In hind-sight I should have figured it out before I made the mistake, but that's hind-sight for you.  If your good with working with tools, and you have a need to adjust a watchband at least every Christmas, then this is a good deal

I don't know for whom watchebands are sized.  Perhaps the Incredible Hulk in his green phase?  All I know is I'm constantly resizing my watchband based on the band, the climate, my activities.  This procedure can be somewhat difficult with some bands.  This complete kit does the trick.  A couple of minutes and a clear spot on my desk and I'm done.  Couldn't get much simpler.  I finally got this kit after wrestling with a new Fossil band that would not cooperate.  Used this kit and the bugger was vanquished in a trice.  Wish I had it years ago

Great kit for working with watches.  The tools were quite good quality, and not flimsy and cheap.  The case was also good, and thankfully wasn't just the typical throw away plastic crap.  The inside of the case is firm foam that keeps the tools nicely in place.  The case itself is firm black leather-like  material and snaps closed.  The kit contains a hammer, band holding base, and several different sized pin drivers for removing band pins.  Also includes the clamp type pin remover (the blue thing), a set of screwdrivers and a thin but sturdy wedge for removing watch backs.  All in all I'm quite pleased with the product.  It was just what I wanted and wasn't very expensive

Atomic watches are highly-accurate quartz watches which are synchronized each day with a time signal broadcast from the definitive U.S. Atomic Clock in Ft. Collins, Colorado. Thus, all atomic watches are always accurate to within a fraction of a second at any time. Since atomic watches adjust automaticaly to and from daylight saving time they are the ultimate in accurate watches. Casio makes -- and Amazon sells -- a wide selection of styles of atomic watches to suit various needs and tastes, but all are equally accurate. The Casio G-Shock series is especially rugged and the solar powered models, such as this, never require battery replacement. Atomic accurary, solar power, and G-Shock ruggedness is an appealing combination at a quite reasonable price

Keeps time very well(obviously).  No problems getting signal to sync with atomic clock.  Chrono, second time zone, all other functions work well.  Love the light function, better than any Indiglo I have owned.  Only quibble is that the alarm needs to be louder

I've had a couple of casio watches in the past, pathfinders to gshocks. This watch is not too big, though it has a pretty thick face, the material looks and feels pretty sturdy.

Setting of the watch is not too difficult, it's similar to other casio watches. I did not have problems getting the hands to match the digital time, it appeared to do it automatially, although i believe you have a feature to intentionally set them out of sync. Radio atomic reception is great, (Austin, Tx). The light is based of two led's on the left and right of the watch face. Although it's not as bright/easy to read as the full illuminator watches that casio/timex has, it sufficiently lights up the screen to read the time, and is quite pretty.

Pro's
-great value, for 79 usd, you get gshock, solar, atomic, metal band
-as a previous reviewer mentioned, you can remove links from the watch in about 10-15 mins with a sharp tipped knife

Con's
-A little heavy
-Digital readout is tiny but adequate (the watch can actually display the current time of day in that tiny circular lcd panel)
-No countdown timer
-Alarm is really short and pretty soft, but that seems to be the case of all casio solar watche

I'm a bit of a collector it seems (by as many watches I've accumulated and rotate out in use)... And I'd compare this watch to my others (Citizen, Seiko, Vostok, Casio) quite well.

Band is well built and easy to resize myself with the tool.  No problems with losing time (wish these things did DST themselves!!!), and date, although somewhat hard to read, does its job.

The numbers on the dial are easy to read and each one (1...12) are phospholuminescent and easy to read in the dark with normal light exposure.

The watch isn't heavy, nor is it on the light side for waches like this, and having buttons on the side has proved useful when timing things - sit-up competitions, runs, etc...

Overall very pleased

Since I had never purchased a watch by Croton, I did not know what to expect.  The watch came in 2 boxes, the first being a black cardboard box detailing the Croton brand in silver on the top center of the lid.  Inside of this box, the watch itself is encased in a nice padded black leather case with the Croton name embossed on the top center of the lid.  On the inside of the lid, there is a "pocket" that stores the instruction guide and a warranty card, which is neatly concealed behind a black piece of material with the Croton logo in silver text.  Needless to say, I will feel good presenting this gift to my boyfriend.

The watch itself has substance to it.  The shape of the watch face is unique as it looks like a more rounded rectangle. The face is blue, and what is nice is that there is a bit of light texturing on the face.  The blue color seems to change from dark to lighter depending on the lighting in the room.  The numbers are clearly visible, but the date is a bit on the small side, but not terrible.  When I took the watch out of the case, I noticed that it was not running and at first, I feared that the watch battery was dead.  This was not the case however, I found that the watch pin on the side was pulled out, which had stopped the watch.  I am not sure why this was done, perhaps it is done to conserve the watch battery?  

The back of the watch has the Croton name etched into the center and underneath, it states that it has a sapphire crystal, Japanese quartz movement and the water resistant details. As for the bracelet, it does not seem to be as heavy as I thought it would be, but I will have a better idea after my boyfriend tries it on.  However, I am expecting that he will need to get the watch sized to fit his wrist, but this not at all surprises me as this has been common practice with many of his watches.  As other reviews mention, the instruction booklet is not for this specific watch and is not so helpful.  

All in all, I think this is a nice watch.  Its design is simple, yet elegant.  I think it will be a good business casual watch, as it can be dressed up for the office, yet be worn after hours and on weekends.  Another nice feature is the fact that it is water resistan

I just received this watch and I have to say it's very sharp looking not to mention has some weight to it. This is not a flimsy watch by any means. It's all stainless steel and the clasp is the easiest I have ever had to negotiate of all the watches I have gone through over the years. It's very secure lock yet simple to unclasp. I would recommend this watch to anyone. Also, it's dressy and casual ~ all purpose watch

I got this for my mother at Christmas and she loved it. You can't help but notice the pendant when she has it on - Very beautiful design, sleek and stylish.  She gets compliments everytime she wears it. Even though this was just an extra gift I think it turned out to be one of her favorite things

I ordered this watch for my husband.  He absolutely loved it!  The
watch band is designed narrower at the point where it connects with the watch.  My Husband especially like that design because he says he can wear it for extended periods without the band pinching or rubbing his wrist.  I was unsure what the quality would be because of the low price, however the watch was an excellent quality product. tmccann, F

This is my 2nd one. That's just because I dropped the other one on my hard tile a few too many times and was tired of sending it in to get fixed.(it was just the watch face that broke, the watch kept on ticking) All you have to do is read the simple directions on entering your age, weight, sex and hit start during your work out. When you're done you can see your average heart rate during your workout, the length of your workout and the calories burned. There are many other things you can do with it such as set an alarm if your heart rate gets too high/too low, set an alarm to wake you up from your power nap, do lap times, etc

Silver Insanity does it again, bringing high quality, unique jewellery to the masses at affordable prices. This necklace is so gorgeous one has to see it up close to fully appreciate it. It is so detailed, even the tiny thorns are so delicate and perfectly placed. This is such a beautiful piece of jewellery that no woman should be without. This Valentine's Day (or anniversary or birthday) instead of buying your woman chocolates that she doesn't need or flowers that will die after a few days, buy her a gorgeous, unique rose that will last forever

THe charm is gorgeous... Any mother would love it from their husband or children. But okay if you are buying this necklace for a mother under the age of 30 they will be okay with the length of the chain, if you are buying the chain especially for a woman who is over the age of 40 they might be bothered by the short chain.. or if they have a large neck not saying my mother has a large neck she just has three surgery scars that the short rubbing chain bothers

Ever notice how hard it is to find a watch that really fits the arm of your 6-year-old? Not any more. This not only gave my kids a watch that actually fits, it was fun for them to assemble them, and they are still mixing up the colors of the bands. You can simply add or subtract links to get the perfect fit. The different links provided means if it breaks, there's plenty of spares. There's no spare clasp pieces, so if they break the clasp, they're done, but the clasps are quite sturdy, the kids have broken a couple of links without breaking the clasps already. They have learned to be aware of the watch on their wrist, so they haven't broken any more links since the first few days (and there's twice as many links as what we need). 

Overall, this was a great product that my kids enjoy.

If your little guy or gal is struggling with telling time and is a Lego fan this is the best deal money can buy. Under $20 and is expandable etc. Probably not the most durable diver type watch you'll ever buy but it is really good looking, easy to assemble (it's a Lego) and all the kids think it's neat to boot

His wrist was too small for mens, too masculine for a womans watch but way too grown up for those babyish kiddie watches.  This IS the perfect accessory for all of your LEGO maniacs! Fun to re-design as well

These watches are awesome.  My two sons, ages 6 and 8 are crazy about them.   They get to customize it to their own likings which makes it easy to tell their watches apart.  When they get tired of it being the same way they just change the Lego pieces around (which helps them in patterning skills and math) and they have a different watch.  My 8 year old had no issue changing his around but the 6 year old might have touble with this since the peices are tiny and snap tightly in to place (that's what Mom's are for).  This is a great beginner's watch but also large enough for older users.  I wore it and thought it was great as well.  It was very fun to wear, everytime I looked down at it I smiled.  In the day and age of digital mania, it is nice to have something so fun for the children to be able to tell "regular" time.  The price was very reasonable especially when the chances of it being lost are very great.  I highly recommend this watch.  I wish they had girl colors

I purchased this watch for my 7 year old son. It is a eye catching and because it's Lego, it was an instant hit. It has numbers on the face (not Roman numerals or lines) which is important when they are beginning to tell time. The price is fair. The only complaint he has is that it is very difficult to put on and because the band is plastic...it gets a bit sweaty.  All in all it's a fun, "Cool!" watch.

The keyring is very nice.  I had no idea just how light titanium is.  The caps screw on and while the engineering and tolerances are quite tight, it's easy to see the caps coming unscrewed, making the ring kinda useless.  Definately advised to crank the caps on very tightly after putting your keys on it.

Additinally, the metal is quite plyable and i've had to stop myself many times from bending the ring while fidgiting with my keys.

i must say i was hesitant to buy after reading the reviews, but they are for my two year old, so i figured they really couldn't be too small. and they are not. i also purchased other earring from some other vender for a lot more $, and guess what, the quality of theese is soooo much better. all in all, yes they are tiny, but very cute and don't lack detail! will buy again

The shape of this pendant is very flattering (elongated, draws the eye downward).  It looks great with the "Windows" hoops I purchased at the same time.  The chain is nice, and as with all Zina sterling - the silver is very polished and beautiful

I bought this watch for my 5 yr old and though it works just fine, the watchband is WAY too big for him.  Fortunately, I am handy with a sewing machine and was able to take a pinch in the band, but it makes it bulky and uncomfortable.  Therefore, he only wears it in bed so that he can play with the indiglo feature in the dark.  As soon as he gets up in the morning, though, he takes it off.

These earrings are quite nice.  Yes they do look brown up to the light, but they are a definite red when backed with any type of shadow.  They can be worn to accent an elegant look, or add style to a "Friday" casual look. They may not be heirloom quality, but could last quite a long time in the modern costume jewelry category.

I bought this as a present for my daughter. I was very pleased with the quality and the finish of the ring. (If anyone wants additional instructions about how to put it together, check wikipedia. I believe there is even a video.) I highly recommend this ring for people who enjoy sterling silver, symbolism, and something just a little bit different

This is a very nice watch. The pink mother-of-pearl face is lovely to look at and the leather strap is very soft. The date is a little small but the watch is so nice that I didn't even care. The only complaint I have is that Amazon sent me this watch with a dead battery inside. I had to get a new battery on my own, but as soon as I told Amazon, they credited me the $10. That was great, but they should have sent me a watch in working condition. Otherwise, the watch is highly recommended. Even nicer than in the photo

I like the stop watch functions that this watch has.  I also like the seperate dials for the different timekeeping functions.  Unfortunately, this watch is hard to read in bright light. Such as sunlight and well lit spaces.  Overall though, I like this watch because it looks good.  Well, it looks good on me anyway

I have owned this watch for over a month now and I can note the following:

The watch has a diameter of approximately 40mm and is around 10mm thick. Both these number seem average and it looks good on an average size wrist.

The watch is a bit heavy, but sits comfortably on the wrist. The bracelet rarely pulls the hair, although I have plenty of it.

The watch is easy to accumulate scratches, but not on the glass. I have scratched the steel around the glass (as well as other places), but the sapphire resists remarkably.

The time keeping is very accurate, compared to the atomic clock on the web. After a month it has advanced less than half a second ahead, which will result in a six second difference at most per year. I guess results may vary between different watches, but it seems nevertheless impressive and trustworthy enough.

The timer is very easy to start, stop and reset, with one button pushes. Very fast and convenient.

The alarm can barely be heard, so is not appropriate for waking. It is useful though for reminders, in a noise free location. Not difficult to set, but takes some time, comparable with setting an alarm on a cell phone. Since it is relative to the secondary time keeping mechanism, you can have a second time zone set and advance the alarm relative to that.

This watch does not seem to attract special attention to it and has not gained any comments so far, without me bringing it in a conversation. Is pretty conservative, but I personally like that.

The price of this watch in amazon seems to fluctuate between 100 and 140 dollars. If the price is higher than 130, I would wait a tad, but not hold my breath too long. It is definately worth the money though, since i have seen several Seiko watches like this one enter their 20 or 30 years of age and still continue strong. For a dependable, accurate, water proof watch for every occasion, most probably you cannot do better than this

I definitely think that selecting white gold is the way to go because it won't distract from the mesmerizing glamour of the diamonds. All my friends were wowed and shared that they will also consdier buying a pair. I am so happy.

These earrings are very small, maybe somewhere between 3 and 4mm each. They do appear white, (I don't see any yellow tinting)  with a slight, slight bit of grey, which I prefer over a super white look (as you might sometimes find in a cz). These earrings catch the light nicely, showing a bit of rainbow effect. They aren't super, super sparkly or faceted, but they do possess shine and detail. I am very happy with these earrings as they are just what I wanted: something petite and real, set in yellow gold, and with a nice, clean and "believably" sparkly look! I also like the fit of the earrings backs, very tight and secure.

I bought these for my wife and she liked them very much.  7mm is not as small as you may think.  I certainly wouldn't buy anything larger in this style.  I got them on sale for $15.00, can't go wrong with that price for 14K gold

I bought these earrings as a Christmas gift for my wife and they look great.  My wife has long dark hair and the 7mm size really stands out.  They came in a dark blue velvet jewel/ring box which comes in another dark blue box.  My wife really loves them so that's a bonus for me.  They are a nice little something for yourself or as a gift

These earrings just arrived, and for $10 (Friday sale), you cannot beat this value.  Luckily I bought two pair, one as a gift, and one for me, on the off chance I liked them.  Otherwise, I thought, I could hold the second pair for one of my granddaughters.  No way; the second pair is mine

This heart box is great for your skagen or other brand watches or you can use it as a jewlery box for your bracelets.  The box makes a v-day or anniversary gift even more special.  Your loved ones will appreciate the box as a sentimental reminder of the special gift.  The watch pillow is plush, padded box top, and outside & inside box is lined with velvet

I am not the type of person that wears JEWELRY, but when I went shoping for a watch, because I needed one, one brand caught my eye...Fossil. Everyone knows Fossil, so, Everyone knows that they make good watches. I like this watch because of the color and because it has the day # on the face. It is like your everyday watch, but with that BLING look. VERY COOL and VERY JAMES BOND. If you know what I mean. I plan to wear this watch everywhere I go. You should get this one not only because it looks cool but because of the price. You know that $$$ makes up your mind for you

I had these on my wish list and decided to order them for myself after Christmas, after looking in stores and not finding anything that looked quite the same!  They just arrived and all I can say is WOW!  Nice look, substantial size and plenty of "statement".  Picture does not do them justice.  All I can say is don't hesitate, you will be dissappointed if they sell out

This is a great choice for a business casual style watch. With it's crystal clear face and smooth shape, it complements most business attire nicely. The adjustment button doesn't get pulled easily, so there is less chance of accidental time loss. After several weeks of wear, still no scratches on the watchface, and the metal remains untarnished. I still get questions about it. Definitely an eye-catcher

The watch itself looks preety elegant. However the bracelet is a bit too rigid and it cand be very unconfortable until you get used to it.

Got this watch for my one son for christmas, but ended up going to the other son,, since his arm is on the small size, and this is a pretty good size watch. IT is beautiful and well described. Arrived in perfect condition and had no problem requesting extra links using the fossil toll free # and then the local store that sells fossils put the links in for me. I went with a small dress watch for the other son.. everyone was happy

I am very impressed with the detail work on this ring. It is really eye catching and quite lovely.   The shipment arrived very quickly.  The stone is a true emerald shade of green and the cut is nice, but the clarity of the stone could be a little better. However, for the price,  it is an excellent ring and I would gladly give it as a gift

This ring is beauriful, and eye catching.  I unfortunatey wore it in a hot tub that had too much clorine in it so the shinyness of the metal faded, and despite that the ring remains beautiful

I was searching the web for weeks... I saw thousands of watches... and I didn't like them. When I saw THIS watch... that was IT - one of the most beautiful watches in the world.

I think design of this watch is superb - very simple, but astonishingly beautiful and original.

But there is one PROBLEM with this watch - it can be purchased only in North America. Being from Europe, I had difficulties to get it

I have thoroughly enjoyed these earrings.  Very nice size and great quality.  They are light-weight and have a great hinge.  I have a baby who sometimes grabs them, but they have yet to be bent out of shape.  I sometimes keep them in for days at a time and my sensitive ears don't ever develope a reaction

This is a perfect anytime gift. I bought this for my gf for xmas and she loved it. We have only been dating for 6 months i did not want to get anything that was over the top.  Perfect for any occasion. She'll love it. 

This will wow her but not worry her to think you are rushing anything 


Plus it's under 100. Can't beat the price. Thanks amazon

I really like them.  They look elegent on me.  One of the most favorite parts besides the looks, that I "especially" like is that they are the french loop kind that are easy and fast to put on and that they are heavy enough that they stay in place.  This reduces the risk of losing them.  But they are also light enough that I don"t feel bogged down with them on my ears.

Very good quality for the price.  They are simple, understated, and classic in design.  If you want flashy, however, these are not for you.  You can ignore the 1-star reviews--the 1-star rating goes to those who a) don't read the description before ordering, b) don't know what mm stands for, or c) don't have the visual-spatial skills to estimate the size of the earring in the picture by comparing the overall size to the earwire (which tends to be a fairly similar size on most earrings).  And please, if you can't tell 14k from $5.00 dimestore stuff that will likely turn your ears green, then your money is wasted here.  Go to Walmart and get yourself something big and cheap

These are delicate, classic gold hoops that go with anything. I like the fact that they are unadorned and simple and small enough to be understatated but large enough to give you an elegant look. The price can't be beat, either

The best dive watch money can buy, bar none.  For $150, you are getting a product that is unparalleled in quality and performance.  It's not perfect, and at around $150 it doesn't have to be, but what you are getting for that amount is far more what I can expect in Swiss Automatics 3x this price range or more.  And don't listen to the lone naysayer out there...I'm not sure what pipe they are smoking out of, but the luminosity of this watch is legendary among watch collectors....charge it up in light for a few seconds and watch this bad boy light up like Chernobyl.  I will echo a truth a fellow collector once related to me..."Any serious watch collector should have a Black Monster in their collection."

I have owned both the black "Monster" with bracelet ( my daily work watch )and the orange with the rubber strap ( which I sold to an envious friend ).
Besides all of the compliments that I have received from those who cant help but to notice the robust build of this model, it has also paid dividends in durability under rough service on the job. I have not been diving in many years however this is the watch that I would be most confident to wear at depth. As usual, Seiko does not disappoint

Great value for the price.  Better than expected in person.  Quality watch for the price.  Love this undersea face better than the other models out there.  Was happy to find out that even though the band is "kid sized", it also fits adult women's wrist.

Highly recommend.  Will probably buy one or 2 more

Although this watch (#MC0478) is labeled for kids, it is best geared for a girl 12-years or older. The timepiece portion appears to be better quality than the jelly strap, which looks very cheap. I purchased this as a gift for my 18-year old sister and went to a local jeweler to replaced the plastic band with a nice blue/green leather one. Overall my sister, who loves the Little Mermaid, is pleased with this watch. So far she hasn't reported any problems with the timepiece.

For the price, it's a good value for the timepiece, but I would recommend upgrading the band. The Little Mermaid face is the main reason I purchased this watch, but if you are looking for a good quality timepiece/band, you may consider another watch

This is the most beautiful bracelet.  The piece is awesome.  The sentiment is so true.  I love this bracelet and decided to keep it even though I'd bought it as a gift.  The workmanship is superb.  The bracelet arrived 2 days after I placed my order in a well packaged box; the bracelet was in a white box with a gold  ribbon around it

I bought two of these faux amber necklaces and they are quite well made. The pendant is almost 2 inches in length it does look larger in the photograph but by being smaller it looks more realistic. It is actually a good weight not to heavy not to light it looks as if some effort has been put into the making of it. I think it is a good purchase for the price because it does not look cheap or tacky

These lovely little gems are perfect for those women who, like me, have a second or third ear piercing. Small enough to be dainty but large enough to be seen without being unnecessarily ostentatious. 
These would make a great gift for a little girl as well.I particularly liked the price point where they were being offered as I suffer from a nickel allergy and always wear gold posts in my ear. Having recently transitioned from yellow to white gold these were lovely additions to my collection. At the price of under 10 dollars I was able to give them to a few others as a little hi there, how are you.

I am really happy with this purchase!  The earrings came together in an attractive box (perfect as a gift, but I don't want to give them away).  They are nice and large on my earlobe and look great.  They are really soft to the touch and I like the colors too.

I bought two pairs, one as a gift for a sister-in-law and the other pair for myself (otherwise I would regret it!) Now my sister keeps complementing how beautuiful the earrings are- I bought another pair as a gift for her! The earrings are absolutely beautiful, the colors that reflect in the light are truly gorgeous. I recommend these for anyone that loves Swarovski crystal

I'm a regular collector of diving watches and this is one of my favorite ones.  There is something about diving watches that is really attractive though it could be subconscious and because of the fact that you can get it wet and it would still work.  This watch feels rock solid like it just came out from a huge chunk of metal.  For such a quality feel, the price is super amazing.  I would have to go for my Submariner for a similar feel and on some days, I prefer the feel of this than of my Submariner!  The luminated markers are the brightest I ever seen on any watch, diving or non-diving.  Clasp is super-awesome, better than the Submariner.  Bracelet is not as nice looking but ok.  The moveable bezel has the best click of any of the diving watches I own and this is the least expensive dive watch of all but unfortunately I paid a little too much.  The only downside and may not be for you if you don't adjust your bands, but if you do, it's a chore.  I spend hours trying to do this and was only successful after improvising as the linking system is very unusual

From the moment you first hold this watch in your hand, you realize it is a quality timepiece. The first thing that strikes you is its large size and heavy feel, yet despite that, it feels comfortable on the wrist due to its fine balance. 

BRACELET: 
The bracelet end links (those that attach to the watch case) are solid rather than formed sheet metal like you will find on most other watches in this price range. The pins holding the bracelet to the watch are the sturdiest I have ever seen. Each of the bracelet's subsequent links is also made from a solid piece of steel, not folded sheet, each component being feather-edged to prevent it digging into the wrist. Its removable link pins are of an unusual machined pin and collar design which, though  fiddly to remove and replace, nevertheless ensure that the pins remain under-flush and secure when correctly installed. The bracelet is perfectly flush on the side that contacts your wrist making it feel very smooth during wear.
The clasp is very high quality, having both a fold over security buckle, which deploys with a satisfying click, and an Omega style double button catch. The security buckle closes onto a spring pin whose ends are spherical thus ensuring a tight fastening which should not wear with use. All in all these features add up to a watch that is very quiet on the wrist, the only faint sound coming from its automatic winding mechanism.
Finally the bracelet incorporates a clever hidden diver's extension (to allow the watch to be worn over a wet suit).

CASE:
The watch case, back and bezel are made from stainless steel. The case has an attractive mix of polished, brushed and machined finishes which all add to the feel of quality and function. The overall impression is that this is a precision instrument rather than a fashion piece; that's not to say though that it would look out of place with a dinner jacket any more than a wet suit.
The unidirectional bezel is of a heavily scalloped design, protected by bezel-guards which extend upwards from each of the lug pairs. The lower guard also functions as a crown guard and, all in all, the impression is of a case machined from a solid billet of  steel. The bezel sits slightly higher than the domed crystal, thus providing protection from scratching and the crystal itself is of a proprietary Seiko material "hardlex" which, as I understand it, is better at resisting scratches than mineral glass but less susceptible to shattering than sapphire.
The luminosity of this watch is astounding due partly to the use of Seiko's proprietary "lumibrite" paint but also to the large coated areas on the hour markers and hands.
The bezel only turns one way, as a safety feature for timing dives, and feels silky smooth, the best I've experienced on any Seiko or Invicta diver. It has 120 clicks per revolution and is nicely aligned with the face.

MOVEMENT:
The watch uses the 21 jewel Seiko 7S26 movement running at 21,600 bph (that's 6 ticks per second).  It is non-hacking which means that the second hand does not stop when the crown is pulled out. Although this makes it difficult to synchronize,  if a slight backward pressure is applied to the fully extended crown, it is possible to stop the second hand. The watch can not be hand wound but the self winding mechanism is very efficient and I have found that it has a power reserve of at least 24 hours. The 7S26 has been around for many years and has a reputation for ruggedness and reliability.

ACCURACY:
There are several reviews where people complain of poor accuracy. Typically, when new, automatic movements will be set to run fast at the factory because they tend to slow down after a few weeks of use. I own three watches with the 7S26 movement and after their breaking in period all are now keeping time to within 10 seconds per day.
I have a few thoughts on accuracy. You have to ask yourself how accurate does your watch need to be? If it is running 10 or 20 seconds fast per day then set it one minute slow and you will only need to re-set it once every week or two when it has advanced to one minute fast. If you need more accuracy then, unless you are willing to pay at least five times as much for a swiss watch, then buy a quartz. 

Finally, if you do a search on the Seiko Monster you'll quickly come to realize that in its various colours, these watches are firm favourites amongst those who frequent the many watch forums. I would highly recommend that you purchase one and see for yourself!

I've had a lot of watches in my life.  Some dressy, some functional, and some practically indestructible.  This watch is a combination of all these factors.  Very solid feeling (and much heavier than my titanium dive watch).  Looks great and functions well.  I also like the wetsuit link which allows a quick adjustment to fit over your wetsuit.  The orange face is very legible, and at night, the watch glows almost bright enough to read by!  The clasp is very secure, with a dual button release and an extra clasp to prevent accidental opening.  Day & date are easy to adjust and very readable (much better than my Citizen).  This is a solid performing watch and worth the  money

The watch looks great; prominent, yet not overly large.  The orange really sets off the look.  The large luminescent indexes are easy to see long after dark.  I also like having both day and date complications, and to find an automatic watch with these features for less than $300 (way less on Amazon) is really a find.  You will need a pro to adjust the bracelet, though, as each link pin is held in by two tiny bushings that are impossible to replace without the proper jeweler's tools.  Another bother is that the watch gains over a minute a day.  Overall, I really like it.  It's become my daily wear watch.

I was a little worried that the bracelet would be too large for a 5 year old, but I got this for my daughter's birthday and it fits her perfectly.  I was also a little concerned that it might be cheap looking like other things I've bought from Amazon lately, but it's actually a very cute, well-made, cheap bracelet

Good looking, stylish, smart and clean design, "handsome".
Once I was specifically looking for "animated" watches. This was one of the results. Although, given Amazon description is really lacking details. I bought it and didn't really know what are the features in general and also specifically concerning the animation. So, now I know. It has a button aside that is switching between two animation schemes. One: seconds numeric value rotates clockwise on the display; two: seconds drop down in two halfs on the display. Thats all for animation and features in general. No light, no more animations, no stoppers/timers, nothing else; just plain watch.
For me, the good looks somewhat compensates the "thing" I was originally looking for

It has a variety of settings that will meet the needs of almost any auto watch on the market.  It is well built, and works as described

I have had this winder for about a month now and I am very happy with it. The major convenience is the well-engineered slots and iserts holding watches that are of a very good quality. The inserts are holding watches steadily which contributes to proper winding. All previous more expensive winders with cushion type inserts were falling out (with watches!)and eventually were rendered useless. Highly recommended unit

Once I got the hang of it it worked like a charm. I needed to mount a magnifying glass to the table so I could see for perfect alignment. If not perfectly aligned you break pins.  Now that I got the hang of it I have one pin left I keep e-maling seller to buy more pins but seller won't answer. Does anyone know where to get more pins? I would buy another unit but seller went to the bank on shipping charges

I have several Fossil watches, and every time I needed to adjust the band, it cost me around $10 - $15. I found this tool and figured it was worth a try. I was able to remove links from 2 of my Fossil watches, though my newest Fossil watch band was too wide to easily fit in the tool. 
 I even used it to adjust watches for 2 of my friends.It worked well, made the adjustments and they were very happy with it! they plan to buy it for themselves!
 you do have to make sure the pin lines up correctly with the pin, but beyond that, it works like a dream

wind the pin in ever so slowly and watch if you aren't going into the hole. the smallest inaccuracy can cause the pin to bend. I straighted mine out and go the pin hole next try and it worked a dream.
Also good lighting is a must

I was expecting this watch to be a little more chunky than it is.  It is a little smaller than I pictured, but it is a nice, non flashy watch.  I haven't received any compliments on it after wearing it for a few weeks, so if you are looking for a subtle, but cute watch, this is for you.  BUt if you want a watch that makes a statment and that people will notice, I'd look elsewhere

I ordered my unit directly from Jewel Jet. Aside from receiving the unit in a box that was severely damaged as it was drop shipped in its own box,  I have no complaints with it working as advertised. The unit is quite large so you may not want to leave on the counter but the results are SPECTACULAR. It definitely out cleans my Sonic Cleaner.  I have not been able to see a difference between this and the results after I get my jewelry steamed at a large retailer like Fortunoff. I first used it on a G Color VS stones, but it has caused me to start pulling out pieces of lesser quality that I have not worn in ages to give them a revitalizing breath of "fresh steam" and I still label the results as SPECTACULAR. I love that I am achieivng these great results with just adding tap water. With my own experimenting, I honestly couldn't tell a difference when using after precleaning pieces in a detergent solution as a competing model - that uses BOTH detergent and distilled water - claims

I purchased this version of the Ironman Triathlon 30-Lap for my two pre-teen boys.  They love it!  Very durable...easy to use...lightweight.  Can't beat the value either.

I own the larger men's version of this watch.  I'm on my second one though.  The first one lasted about a year before it developed condensation under the glass, then stopped working.  I surf 3-4 times per week and I wasn't rinsing the watch well with fresh water.  I'm guessing that the salt deposits compromised the seal on the watch.

I've had my second one for over a year now and it's like new!  I highly recommend this watch if you're very active and want a good lightweight watch that's waterproof

I have owned several Ironman over the last 30 years or so and I have been pleased.  However, my last Timex watch had a twist of the dial control function and was a great disappointment as the dial became difficult to twist and finally the watch stopped working after only six months.  I was very disappointed in Timex and almost didn't buy this one.  This watch is the traditional men's Ironman, but smaller than I had purchased before and it fits nicely on my large wrist with plenty of band length. I have owned the new watch for three months with fairly rugged use and it functions great with easy to operate controls and it is very readable.  My wife and adult children tell me that it looks like a women's watch but I think they are used to oversized wathes that have been in style and I assure them that I am on the cutting edge of a new trend towards smaller (and more reasonally sized) wrist watches for men.  I am happy to say, that once again, I am very pleased with Timex.

These earrings are a good size but still very light.  It is a little tricky to learn how to fasten them, but once hooked they stay safely closed all day.  The clasp sytem does not show once the earrings are on - so this is a very clean and classic look.  I have long hair and the clasp does not tangle in my hair

This is a very nice piece... I've been looking for a key pendant for a while now... But all the ones I've seen have been very feminine.  And this one, while slightly satanic... Fits nicely to the meaning I wanted, without making me feel like a fairy princess.  

Shipping even got here early...!

My only problem with it is having to pull out the pliers to get it to fit on a different neck piece from the same seller.  4/5

Silver Insanity has the best accessories!!! I saw the image of the ring on Amazon and immediately fell in love. I love rings that covers your proximal phalanx (the bone in your finger closest to your hand). When I received the ring, (earlier than counted upon), I was a little disappointed to see how little it looked and how dainty but that was before I tried it on. I was expecting the ring to be bulky and glad it wasn't. The fingers surrounding it wasn't bothered or irritated thx to the rings slimness. I recommend using the ring size chart b/c I had thought I'd be a 6; turns out, I'm a 7. What was misleading, though, is the picture. The leaves are shown bright, but it looks noticably darker (inside the outer rimming of the leaf, to where the gems are) when you have it in your hands. My fingers are long and slender. The ring didn't twist or turn about, but it didn't cover my proximal phalanx completely. I'll measure... from the end of the bottom leave to the end of the top, it's about 3.3cm. My middle proximal phalanx (the bone in your middle finger closest to your hand) is about 3.8cm. And if you should run your fingers through your hair, the leaves will not get entangled! Nice!
You can wear the damn ring everywhere!!! I love it

As other reviewers have stated - this watch is large and it's heavy. I think it would look best on a larger person with big wrists or arms.  The night light is cool and effective.

Classy look and very durable. Very nice watch for the price. I bought mine at a discount store and paid about $6 more for it. I like it, despite its 10mm thickness. Not that heavy if you're like me, 6'2" and 250lbs. It's a man's watch, practical yet with some style while not being trendy. I haven't had any problems with it so far, despite having dropped it twice and worn it outside while working and getting it soaked with sweat multiple times. I don't find it uncomfortable at all and I forget I am wearing it. (I suggest taking it off, the leather band doesn't clean easily like a metal band.) I'm considering buying a second one and keeping it cleaner this time. (Lesson learned.

I wanted a basic watch that would be for everyday use and liked this Timex design.  I was very pleased that it looked even nicer in person...clear face, leather band with slightly heavier stitching than some, good weight (not too heavy).  I have received a few compliments at work/co-workers were surprised at the value for the cost.  Overall, a solid Timex offering that you will enjoy if you're drawn to the style/image that appears here in the product details

I ordered (not from Amazon) a black titanium watch with a black face and white hands (model 530LTMLB, for those of you scoring at home). After an apologetic out-of-stock phone call from the dealer, I settled on what I thought was going to be the same watch but with a white face and black hands (model 530LTMLW, for you precise types). 

What I got instead was this watch. In the photograph, it looks like dark gray matte metal with a white face. It's not: It's eggshell light gray metal with a mother-of-pearlish face.

I hadn't worn a watch in five years: after all, who needs one in the cell-phone age? (Definitive answer: anyone driving across country with a Sprint cellphone). I took my sweet time selecting a new watch, and got something completely different from what I ordered. I could easily have returned it. Before I did, I slipped in on my wrist to see what it felt like, and promptly forgot that it was there.

(To the nice lady who answered my request for the time with a drop-dead-you're-wearing-a-watch response, can I say that it wasn't actually a pickup line?)

The titanium thing is not a gimmick: this watch is (obviously) very light indeed, and solid. I have hopes that the light gray colour is undoctored titanium alloy, in which case it will still look good after life deals it some hard knocks. 

I set it to the exact (down to the second) correct time when I got it a month ago. It either has a very good movement, or it's secretly communicating with that atomic clock in Colorado without my knowledge.

Some reviewers have complained about a poor latch: I respectfully suggest they don't know how to close it. The watch has a very secure double-latch, which is poorly-explained but is not rocket science - I've added the instructions at the end.

Some complain about noise: this might be a quality-control issue. I can't comment to it because my watch is as quiet as the heartbeat of a fetus.
(Update several weeks later: The watch is slowly becoming louder, but the loudness changes irregularly, even when the watch is sitting by my bed. It is still very quiet, but but the fact that it is changing does not speak well to long-term durability.)

It gets 4 stars because I can't tell the time with my glasses off, which is why I wanted a high-contrast watch in the first place. But they're not getting this one back.

LATCH INSTRUCTIONS:
To get us properly oriented, lay the watch flat, with the face up. On one end of the strap is the half of the clasp that also contains the strap length adjustment. Open up the clasp part. Next to the strap length adjustment mechanism you will see a plain bar. Now look at the other end of the strap: on the very end of it is a solid, curved clasp. Swing it open, and you will see a wide double hook. 

Put the watch on your wrist, and attach the double hook to the plain bar. Next, close the solid clasp until it clicks. Next, close the other clasp over the first one, also until it clicks.

It is provably impossible for any single brush up against an object (say, an outboard motor) to loosen it

I've had this watch for about nine months now. I wear it every day. It keeps great time and looks great as well. Many people have complimented me on the design of this watch and asked me who made it. The mesh band is the most comfortable and lightest band you will ever wear.

I saw these Skagen watches in a local clock store, and fell in love with the titanium model. It is extremely light and comfortable. I was a little concerned about quality because it was so inexpensive for titanium. Though the movement is made in Japan, the rest of the watch is assembled somewhere else, I would assume Hong Kong. The word "Denmark" on the face is strictly for style, no part of the watches are made there. Regardless, it seems to be very well made; I've had mine for a year now, and it keeps excellent time and runs reliably. I bought a different Skagen model for my wife at the same time, and hers is just as well made. It has been a great watch and I heartily recommend it.

EDIT: I have been taking swimming lessons, and wearing this watch during them. It has not leaked a drop. I was told it was not suitable for any real depth, such as those encountered while snorkeling or scuba diving, but every other underwater test I've given it, it has passed.

The pliers do the job & seem to be well made. My only problem was the awkwardness in trying to align the link. I guess if you remove the band from the watch, it would make it easier. In that case I recommend one of the pin removers that sit flat on a horizontal surface. BUT...this did do the job (even leaving the band on the watch). It comes with a smaller sized push pin that is a breeze to swap out

I never adjusted a watch band before and I thought it was going to be difficult after reading the other reviews on the other watch tools. This tool could not have made it any easier, I didn't break any pins and I adjusted two watch bands the night it arrived with ease. You will need a pair of needle nose pliers to pull the watch pin completely out of the band. I adjusted an Accutron Lady's York and a Swiss Army Men's Maverick. I used the tool to remove and replace the watch pins, just line the pins and squeeze the pliers slowly. The accutron used solid pins and the Swiss Army used pins that looked like they were screws but were pins that are cut or bent in half so always push from the end that looks like a screw head

I first purchased this watch in 1994 when I entered the selection coarse to be an Air Force CCT.  I lost the watch years later but I would occasionally try to find a replacement with no luck.  I now work for US DOJ and will be deployed to Baghdad for a while and I need a watch I will be able to absolutely depend on in extreme conditions.  This is the only watch I will ever own.  I cannot say enough about it.  Maybe I'm sentimental but I love this watch

I bought my first Casio Diver's watch with the gold face years ago.  I wore the heck out of it, and eventually, the band broke.  I must have hunted for a replacement band or a whole new watch but to no avail.  A long-time friend then just sat in a drawer.  Recently, I found these watches were still available so I got a new one.  I even found a replacement band (made by Timex) for my original watch.  I must say I once again feel whole again.  This watch has timeless styling and wonderful functionality in a very reasonable priced watch.  I'm thinking about getting the black and the white ones so I can switch it up from time to time

This watch was great. I really loved the digital feature residing in the analog face. 
I don't know about others out there but analog watches are the only way to go. I love the fact that I can visually see what time it is in a graphical representation, but I love having the digital features such as the alarm, timer, stopwatch, and date feature.
I wore the watch 24/7 and it never ever gave me a problem, however, when I was filming an independent film within a west texas silo I lost the watch climbing the ladder out. I was climbing a straight vertical steel pipe ladder and as I reached the top hatch, which lead to the top landing, my watch face caught on the side of the steel ladder and the band pins broke. Next thing I knew I heard a "plop" and new my wonderful watch was on its way to the bottom of a 120 foot watery depth!!
I will probably get another one but I really would love one with a metal band

Overall the watch is awesome.  I do actually use it when diving, though it is only rated as water "resistant" and not waterproof.  I can say it holds up to at least 90 feet.  The dial is very readable at depth, the digital display however is not.  The multifunction display has no backlight and at times can be hard to make out, even on land.  The display does have luminescent hands and numbers that can be make out with no problem.  Very comfortable and functional

I first got one of these when it was issued to me in the Air Force back in the early 1990's.  As a fighter pilot (former) I've busted more watches in cockpits than most but this one held up.  Now that I'm in the more sedate confines of an airline cockpit, I still wear it.  It has dual time zones and an alarm, perfect for international travel.  Beware, it's a BIG watch!  If that's not your style, you may want to see one in person before you buy.  The only drawback... the plastic/rubber band will crack after 2+ years and need replacement.  I put a nice leather band on mine and even had a passenger compliment me on my "Breitling".  When I told him it was a Casio and cost $4950 less, he wanted one too.

After nearly two months my two automatic watches are ticking happily away. The mechanism is very quiet and the winder looks tidy.
The only critisism I have is lack of instructions to mount the watches. Maybe all winders work the same way but this was my first experience with wone and it took a while to work out the watch mounts are spring loaded to accept teh watch band. Once I sorted that out - no problem

The product, as i recalled, cost about $36 for a double winder.  The product works quite well and is reasonably quiet.  If one reads one of the watch magazines on the market one will quickly find out there are many watch winders out there and most cost a lot of money--in the hundreds to thousands of dollars. This product is in the tens of dollars and works very well.  I am very happy with the product--as well as Amazon (dot) com.

I needed to replace another Timex Ironman 100 lap watch I had purchased a few years back (the rubber frame that holds the strap broke).  Really liked this watch because of the large readout, ease of use, lap calculation.  I'm a Marathoner and novice Triathlete, so a good, simple, versatile watch is an important piece of equipment for me.  After looking for over a month, I decided to purchase the Timex Triathlon 100 Lap Flix System Watch, and I'm glad I did.  Great readout, easy button control (start and split are much more pronounced - great improvement) and a very sturdy velcro strap makes this a winner for me.  I've already used the timer function with alarm for my swim and bike intervals, and of course the chrono function with splits is easy to read and use.  This is a great watch!

This is the second pair of earrings I got from Silver Insanity, and I can tell you you won't be dissapointed.  They may be synthetic, but no one will ever guess while you're wearing them!  They catch the light beautifully, and the delicate silver design compliments the gems perfectly.  I always get compliments when I wear these.  And you can't beat the price

My son tells me that he loves his watch and would give it 500 out of 5 stars.  He saved up for it, and he bought it with his own money after his ADHD and Asperger's self had trouble walking home from the library one too many times when it was time (and after more than a few reminders).  He'd also missed cello lessons at school and was very frustrated with himself for the difficulties he was having.  It is a cool watch.  It looks good, it has two alarms (cello lesson and whatever else he needs) a stop watch and a countdown timer--that he's found a use for so far.  It is waterproof/or resistant, so that means when he forgets to take it off before his bath it's ok.  This watch was a way that he could solve his own problems, and reorganize his own life to make up for some of his difficulties.  That's why I like it so much.

It has all these features and looks really cool and it doesn't cost an arm and a leg.  That's the best, I think. I'm not sure if he'll ever need the lap timer or the pacing feature or anything like that.  I suppose those features are awesome for those who use them, but for our purposes and our budget, this watch is perfect

This is a must have watch for serious runners.  I have had mine for over a month and I love mine.  I am a professional track and field athlete, and I train very hard to win races.  This watch helps me train better than any other watch I've ever had.  It gives you up to 50 lap splits which are great for any workout that is over 800 meters on a track.  Not only that but it has 5 interval timers, which you can set your appropriate rest time on.
   If you are a serious runner like myself, I highly suggest you get this watch.  It is definately something that you will need

I have longed for gold hoop earrings for years.  These seemed liked they were the ones!  But I waited a while, still debating..... finally 'went for it' and got a pair. I haven't regretted it at all.  I find these earrings comfortable, and I like the way they look on me.  I am very happy with these and recommend these beauties!..... Now, if they would make them in white gold..........

Zina makes wonderful jewelry and that is why I am frustrated that they use such a cheap chain for this pendant. The pendant itself is beautiful and the silver SHINES, but the garnet is very small.  It is a nice red color though. I purchased this on sale and that is why it gets four stars and not three.

If you want a subtle piece of jewelry that will get attention, this is it! I have gotten more compliments and questions from strangers when I wear these (earrings and pendant) than I have from all the Swarovski jewelry I have created and worn.  This is a very different color than I have ever worked with; it appears as if two sides only are 2x AB and the other two aren't - quite unusual which makes it fun

This watch is you would expect from any Timex watch.  It's easy to read the face while running, easy to set, big button on the front for the light so no fumbing when wearing gloves for the little side button on some.  It's lightweight if a bit stiff to start with, but eventually easied a bit with age.  I only use it for running timing, not my everyday watch, but I'll buy one again when I lose this one (as I usually lose them long before they wear out).  I haven't had it long enough to notice any real wear in the band yet, not sure if it'll wear out easier or not, but so far, so good (1 year)

Great features on this watch.  I especially like the linked timers and the three alarms.  My wrist is tiny, and the selection of holes is great (I use the tightest).  This does leave a gap because the band is still bigger than my wrist, and the extra band wraps all the way around, but it doesn't slip and it feels very comfortable.  The alarm sound is pleasant.  The color is great too

Its tough to beat the price of these 1/2 ct. diamonds for $199; they looked really good and the wife loved them.  The only reason I gave 4 stars is because they only have non-screw backs and they didn't come with a diamond spec sheet to verify what you got.  But for the price, a minor quibble... you won't be disappointed with your purchase

This is my third Skagen watch.  The design is ultra thin and the titanium consturction makes it ultra light. The design is sophisticated enough for dress and sleek enough for sports wear. They have proven to be reliable timekeepers and I liked this one so much I bought two more for my sons. At less than $80.00 each they are a real bargin

I've had two Skagen Watches and have to say they are my favorite. I love the large face and the Titanium bracelet (you don't have to remove the watch in order to shower!). A lot of people have complimented me on the watch, too. Given the price and quality, you can't go wrong. If you ever need a part replaced, you just send it to Skagen; the work is completed in a couple of weeks! In summary: an elegant watch at a reasonable price

I read the reviews about people saying their watch scratched and lost paint on it.  Mine has not done this with the exception of the clasp.  Since the watch and band are titanium it should be anondized, meaning it's not going to come off.  However the clasp and a few other small parts (watch hands) are made of stainless steel, so they will start losing their finish after awhile.

After wearing this watch for a few weeks, I went and put on my old stainless steel Citizen watch.  It felt huge and felt like it weighed a ton.  I went and weighed each of them.  The Citizen came in around 4.5oz, while the Skagen came in at around 1.5oz.  It is also very thin, I used to not be able to wear a watch since typing on a computer all day the band would irritate me, have not had any problems with the Skagen.

One other thing to note, the picture for this item shows the Steel watch (you can see it on the face), if you want to see a picture of the titanium one, take the product number and go to skagen's site, or google.

The skagen lost a star because of the paint coming off the clasp (not the band)

My roommate got this for his girlfriend, and after examining his girlfriend's ears, I have decided that these earrings are great for the price. Not something you want to give your wife, but an excellent gift for a young boyfriend trying to impress his young (or old) girlfriend with an entry-level "nice" gift. They are a decent size, and no faults are noticeable at a normal distance. Recommended

I am extremely impressed with the feel, look and general quality of the watch.  It contains the Citizen Miyota 21 jewel automatic movement that is a true workhorse for a fraction of the price.  The comfortable stainess steel pinned link bracelet is worth the price of the watch. It has rounded flexible brushed steel wrist links The foldover adjustable double safety clasp uses pins as well. Can easily be mistaken for a watch costing much more.  The Mineral Glass crystal is scratch resistant - but not as good as a sapphire watch face, but is less prone to chipping or shattering than a sapphire crystal. The display watchback is also mineral glass - displaying the undecorated Miyota automatic movement. It look as stylish and run as well as my other watches, and, I receive as many comments if not more from the Invicta's.  It is a great looking watch!  Good value, accurate and stylish if you like the Sub' look. This is a good day-to-day knock about watch that still looks better than the quartz stuff in the same price band. If it lasts 5 years it's more than paid for itself

I bought one as a gift. It looks great on him. But it ran out of battery after half a year, and my friend need get it fixed. This should not happend for a new watch. As the watch was already started when I received it, there was a possibility that it wasn't brand new when I bought them. Other than that, it is a good buy

Because I teach, I wear a man's watch so I can keep my eye on the clock without seeming to look at my watch all the time.  This beauty has a very easy to read dial.  And it looks very cool and retro--I've gotten many compliments.  I should probably have the bracelet made smaller--it's one of the bigger-sized men's watches I've ever worn--so I think it would be a great choice for big guys.  I am quite pleased with my purchase.  The price was nice, too

This watch is generally a good watch, but there are some flaws in ours--not a surprise considering the price.  One, there is a white haze under the crystal when viewed in the sunlight--perhaps the result of careless manufacturing and cleaning.  Two, my son has had the band come apart twice in one month.  The later probably a design issue relative to all the spring-loaded retainers and such, and the general range of movement of the clasp

This watch looks great although I was afraid that it was going to be bulky.  It has worked great for my husband.  The only problem we have had with it is setting the date on it.  No matter what time of day we set the date, it is always the wrong date by the next day

This watch looks like business.  The movement is what I really like.  You get about 5 ticks per second instead of 1 so it looks more sweeping (though I wouldn't call it sweeping).  I give it a 5 based on looks and cost.  I haven't had it long, and it took a couple days of wearing it for it to keep time correctly (it was losing a few hours at night).  I guess it just needed to get charged up.  It's no Rolex, but it's no Casio either.

This watch looks and feels great on me. Yes, I had to take out about 6 links to get a good fit, but that was fairly easy and only took 5 minutes (which included figuring out how to do it, which I'll explain at the end).

The clasp locks well - firm, but not difficult to lock/unlock, and is very secure. I was a little suprised with how lightweight the links/band is. That's the only part of the watch that feels a little cheap. Don't get me wrong, it's well constructed, but it's not like a Big Manly Steel Band. At the end of the day, I found that I loved it because it ISN'T heavy.

I didn't give it a full 5 stars because after having it a few weeks there's a teeny tiny scratch that developed on the face/crystal. I'm really cautious and have been gentle with it, so I'm rather disappointed this happened. (And it very possibly might have been me knocking up against a brick wall or something). If you're especially rough on your things, this might not be the best watch for you.

Taking the links out is EASY if you're not completely inept. You'll want something small and sort-of pointy (I happened to have had a filed-down mini screwdriver, but a nail would probably work just as well). I found it easiest to first disconnect the standard clasp - just push the pin in (on either side) and wiggle the clasp apart. Make sure you don't drop/lose the pin. 

For the links, it's fool-proof - it has an arrow engraved on the back of the links, showing you which side the pin/insert comes out. Stick the nail/whatever into the small oval hole and pry the pin out the side. Pull it out with a pair of pliers (it's in there pretty tight) and you can then remove the link

The watch arrived in great condition, it is a very stylish and affordable watch, the only thing is that it is a tad too big and my boyfriends had to take some links out.  He has a big wrist so it was a little unusual.  Nice watch though! No regrets

This ring is absolutely gorgeous and I havent taken it off since recieving it. But when buying this ring, be careful not to take the string off of the bands. This string protects you from well....insanity. I unfortunately took off the string and my ring separated into the 4 separate bands. Luckily I found a website that gave me instructions on how to reassemble it. My dad put it back together and it was fine, but I have to admit I'm a little distraut about how there is no indication or warning telling people not to take it off. If this does happen to you, google "puzzle ring solutions" and there are many websites to guide you in restoring your ring to normal.

I love this ring! It's interesting to look at, and I like the design. I haven't taken the string off for fear of not being able to figure out the puzzle. Maybe one day I might try it, but I like it so much I don't want to chance it now. Shipped fast

This bracelet looks better than the picture.  It looks beautiful on my wrist. The fifty bucks that I paid for it was a real bargain. I love it. There's only one drawback, it's 8 inches long and that's too long for my wrist. If it fit perfectly, I'd give it ten stars. I'll pay to make it smaller. It's made of titanium, and maybe it's too tough to alter. I want it to fit over that knot on my wrist. If I can get it altered, I'll wear it until the day I die, which I hope will be 100 years from now

As a gift, this bracelet will not disappoint.  It appears just (or better) as it does in the picture.  The only downside is that, for a gentlemen with a thicker bone structure, there will not be any give, nor do they provide extra links to make it a bit more comfortable.  Otherwise, one cannot go wrong with selecting it

Beautiful Watch!! I was already familiar with Invicta and know that they're worth three times the price and that in the future they will be.  Had it in just a few days.  Don't let the picture fool you.  It does not do this piece justice and you would be better off going to another site to view what this watch actually looks like...looks like it cost a whole lot more.  I've been watching Invicta's for about a year now and if you find a better price than this...It's stolen!!!

This color was on a price special and I liked the look in the picture so I chose this model.  I found that the silver on silver makes it a bit more difficult to read than I would have liked but it's adequate.  Good, accurate movement as the other Invicta timepieces I've owned or known of have also been.  This one is quite heavy and has a feel of a more pricey timepiece.  Mine is running about 3 seconds slow per week which doesn't seem bad but former Invictas I've had were a bit better than this.

Update to prior review....  Now that the watch has limbered up, the accuracy has improved and I've hardly needed to touch it

I had one exactly like this one for over 20 years, but finally the crown fell off.  I am keeping it for a backup as it is still running just fine.
I expect the same quality of my new Seiko.  I highly recommend this model.  Easy to read dial (especially the white face) and also a fine looking piece of jewelry

Extremely reliable, easy to read, looks like the Rolex style, only it is very lightweight. Good for everyday use because you can wear either gold or silver jewelry with this watch. I would have given it 5 stars if it were one of those models which does not need a battery

This item was very nice.  The chain was longer than I expected and hangs really low on my neck, but it only looks like the real one.  You can tell that it is a knock off, but you get what you pay for.  For $5 I think that it was worth it, but it does look different than the "real" one.  Good service and delivery

This invicta is a really nice watch but with some problems: All metal surfaces are polished on this watch so they scratch very easily and quickly. And the clock face is a bit too shiny in my opinion (hard to read in direct light).
Also, who needs a 24h dial on a chronograph (instead of a 1/10s dial)?

But overall for this price a good deal and good looking

The bracelets were as advertised, shipping was reasonably prompt.
The only thing that I am slightly worried about is whether the elastic band which holds the pearls is strong enough to last for some time. These were not intended for me, I bought them as a gift for my mother and I can only comment on its longevity only after she's used them for some time

Obviously the pearls are flawed, but because of their size you can't tell even from a short distance away.

They're super cute, but I suggest getting them 2 or 3 at a time as they look a bit awkward on their own

I ordered one each for my 5-year-old daughter and her 2 friends for Valentine's Day.  Nice pearl color and oval-like shapes.  Slightly too big for a 5-year-old but would be good for older children or a small wristed adult. Very dainty.  A great buy for the price

I haven't worn pierced earrings in years;I thought they were sealed. When I discovered that they were indeed open, I sought some simple gold post types to wear. When I saw my March birthstone set in a simple gold setting, I couldn't resist it. The actual earring is so elegant! 'Tis exactly as described, and more! Wearing such graceful simplicity in my beauty-starved lobes makes me feel like royalty! And for such a small price with the security of Amazon!
What a joy! 
Sincerely,

These earrings are so exceptionally shiny and cute.  The are a nice size and look very well made. A couple of small drawbacks:  The pointy edges of the sunshine's rays are kind of sharp and also, the hook part seems to be extra thin because a normal small rubber back does not fit and will slide right off but if you wear the earrings without a rubber back, they will slide out and you will lose them (I know this because I had to backtrack in the grocery store only to find my missing earring in the produce section!).  They DO provide a rubber back that fits but it is so very very tiny that I could easily lose it and it's hard to handle with fingernails.  BUT don't let those things stop you from buying these earrings because they are so distinctive and attractive.  I always get lots of compliments when I wear them

This watch is definitely something that I will keep with me for a while.  It is simple, elegant, and came to me for relatively cheap.  The free shipping is always a bonus, and I also came across it in the Gold Box deals, and when I saw it I knew I had to have it.  It is pink and is lighter pink in the center.  The bracelet was large with the extra links, so I removed them and took it to the store to make it smaller. I think its a great watch for both casual and more formal settings

My husband LOVES this watch. He was SO excited that it looks even better in person than the picture. As soon as he shook it, the watch did exactly what it was suppose to and set itself to the right time, date, and month. He's absolutely thrilled with it. And I was thrilled with the price from this company. Thanks all around

An Excellent Watch With One Small Criticism

My wife commented to me on the attractiveness of this watch, something she has never done before as she doesn't own a watch, and has no interest in them. It is a beautiful timepiece.

What can you really say other than what is listed in the specifications. It works just fine, and keeps perfect time.

So, what is my small criticism? There is a lot of gold and white coloring on the face of the watch, and there is a lot of gold and white on the hands. The problem is that at certain times it is somewhat difficult to distinguish the hands from the background. If you have perfect eyesight this might not be a problem. My eyes are decidedly not perfect. Gone are the days when I can surreptitiously glance at my watch while listening to some boring conversationalist. I generally have to bring the watch to about a foot from my face to read the hands.

Still it is a great watch, and I feel compelled to give it a full five stars

I have enjoyed the oregon series watch.  It is good looking.  The band is comfortable and is holding up nicely.  The display is easy to read, and the light is quite good.  My one complaint is that the chronograph is often difficult to clear.  I run a good bit, and I was doing a workout the other day.  I had to keep holding down the clear button to get the old time off.  Other than that, I have enjoyed the watch immensely.  I thought the price was extremely reasonable as well

it's got an alarm, stop watch, timer, lap timer, 5 alarms actually, a water break alarm, water resistant, although don't go aggressive swimming with it because water leaked inside mine, and when it gets hot outside, water vapor rises to the glass dial and it blurs out the time...but other than that, it's a great watch, finest i've owned in terms of digital watch, i highly recommend it

I bought this watch for my son, a Marine, serving in Iraq, because he requested a sturdy digital with an alarm. This one had a large face which he says is extremely easy to read in any light, especially at night.
It is comfortable, and sits close to the wrist with very little profile.
He loves it, and asked me to order a second one because he wants a back-up!

Atomic watches are highly-accurate quartz watches which are synchronized each day with a time signal broadcast in the U.S. from the definitive U.S. Atomic Clock in Ft. Collins, Colorado. Thus, all atomic watches are always accurate to within a fraction of a second at any time. Since atomic watches adjust automaticaly to and from daylight saving time they are convenient as well as highly accurate. Casio makes -- and Amazon sells -- a wide selection of styles of atomic watches to suit various needs and tastes, including G-Shock watches for extra ruggedness and solar-powered watches which never need replacement batteries. But all atomic watches, including this budget-priced Waveceptor model, are equally accurate to a fraction of a second at all times. If you want a numbered-face watch that is always accurate this model is a real bargain

I like this watch as it was pretty cheap and it keeps good time, right with WWV time clock for the last couple of months since I got it. I am extremely hard on watches. The crystal is not hard so it is scratched already. The time is very accurate with the Colorado WWV time station. For 30 bucks or so, except for the scratched face is the only issue. Worth the mone

I wanted an inexpensive watch which keeps accurate time. This fills the bill quite nicely. It sets itself daily and even uses WWV's "leap year" flag so you don't have to worry about the Daylight Savings time change.

It is a bit fussy here in Pittsburgh (hill country). It took a bit of experimentation to find some place to sit it overnight where it will get a good signal. It instructs in the manual to sit it near a window with the "six" on the watch pointed at the window and to let it sit for up to 10 minutes.

I followed the manual instructions several times. Then I picked up the watch right after I initiated the manual search for the signal. I moved it around until it showed a steady "3" (highest signal level). Problem solved.

Adjusting the band should be as simple as looking for the arrows and pusing out the pin, etc. Except it require brute force. I broke a jeweler's screwdriver and small punch in the process.

I should have bought an expansion band at the same time

Actually, it's a fabulous watch.  It looks great, does everything that you would expect, and is a joy to look at - I've swapped it for a watch that my wife bought me for a wedding present "just to get used to it for a bit" (which obviously she's less than pleased about), and everytime I look at it I see a really great watch that I'm really pleased I bought.

HOWEVER, if there was a design fault, it would be this: when you start and then stop the stop watch, you cannot reset without pressing and holding the reset button; surely it would be better for a one-touch reset?  Also, with the Timer - loop 3 (which is continuous countdown) the reset button (again press and hold) resets the timer to zero (as you would expect the 'set' button to do), and the set button (press and hold) resets the timer to the original timer setting (eg 5 mins) - surely these are the wrong way round?  All a bit odd, but sort-of OK once you get used to it.  Seems a bit sloppy though in its design.

Nonetheless, overall an excellent watch.  I'm really please I bought it and it's very useful for triathlon events, using the lap on the stopwatch

My last Ironman lasted 12 years of very hard usage in the restaurant business---lots of heat, grease and water! My new Timex Combo Dual Tech Watch has all the same features, especially the timers which I can set at different intervals. You can't beat the price for this rugged but sleak looking watch. A plus---it has both digital time and good old watch hands

This watch met all my requirements, and it well suited for my hand. 
I liked the feature of turning the digital display ON & OFF. The strap is also smooth, doest hurt ur skin. 
The only negative remark I found with this watch is the INDIGLO night-light is not that bright as I expected or was not equivalent to my previous watch.

This watch is great.  It has full iron man functionality and actually looks nicer than a geeky casio - unlike prior iron man watches.  I probably should have gone with the steel band as it could be worn out as well.  It has solid construction and easy functionality.  The indiglo could be a little brighter but I am sure that would cost battery life.

I'm a wristwatch fan, and I have a modest collection of nice luxury watches, and I was looking for something inexpensive that I could use for "rough" activities where I don't want to damage my nicer Omega or Rolex watches. I wanted something with sport functions and alarm.

Most sports watches with digital displays (e.g. Casio or even other Timex Ironmans) are pretty ugly, they look out of place wearing anything but sweats and sneakers. But I was pleasantly surprised by this Timex model. You can turn off the digital display and it looks like a reasonable handsome analog watch, but one press and the display functions appear again. However, there are some drawbacks:
- the digits can be hidden by the thick hands of the analog display.
- The white on black digital display isn't very clear except in good light. You'll be using the Indiglo backlight often.

The rest of the watch is pretty nice overall. The casing is heavy, and thick but thanks to the comfortable rubber band, I don't find the watch annoying on my small wrist. The loop on the band to hold the end of the band secure stays put pretty well. The overall weight is hefty but not as overbearing as some other watches with metal straps. The finish isn't exactly Rolex quality, it looks like what you expect a $50 watch, the brushing is a bit uneven. The design is modern and smooth, and the watch looks a bit more expensive than it is.

The functions of the watch are pretty typical of any digital watch. There isn't anything about the watch I find confusing. As long as you walk through the functions once in the manual, you shouldn't have problems doing it again later without the manual. Usually you have to hold the top left button to go into set modes, and the other buttons go up/down or advance the setting mode. I could completely figure out the watch without the manual. 

As for the sport functions, the three loop countdown timers allow you to set up intervals. For example, you can one loop to time running interval, and then a second loop for the walk break. The chrono function keeps track of 42 laps, and you can see each lap time in the recall mode. However, because the hands can easily cover the digits, I wouldn't suggest this watch if you really need to be able to read the digits at all times, stick with a digital only Ironman model

The Indiglo backlight just adds enough light to the digits to allow you to see the light in any lighting condition, but as I said, you'll more likely to use it in this watch because of the low contrast of the digits. The Alarm is average for a digital watch, it is good enough to wake most people when placed on the bedside (it isn't very loud worn on the wirst)

This is a Big watch for the price!
(44mm I believe)....You have to buy a vintage dive watch to find one this large..... I agree with the other reviewer about the strap.I  lost a Casio just like this before @ the beach .I now have a "waterborne" dive-strap on my new one.....a one directional bezel & a screw-down crown would be nice on future models...Also be ready to be asked  "What Time is it?" a lot when you wear it to the Beach ...;)

This model has been out for a long time. I like the look of the black more then the white or gold. The reason the watch loses one star is because the band. It looks great, but the rubber will wear out and break in about a year. The replacement band that Casio offers looks close the orginal, but not exactly the same. I lost one of these, and another was stolen. So the fact that I am on my third is a statement to how much I love this watch. I have been wearing it since about 1993

I bought this necklace along with 13 other Hematite Necklaces they are all Absolutely Beautiful and the quality is exceptional and the price is awesome you can not beat it. Shipping and handling was very reasonable also. Here is some information on Hematite and why it is one of my favorite stones:
Hematite: Element Earth 
Chakras: Root (1st)
Hematite is the most effective of all stones for grounding oneself in the body and physical world. It can counteract spaciness and confusion, helping one to see the practical concerns and move forward with useful action. Hematite can be used to balance the auric field and align the chakras. It pulls stray energies down through the meridian sytem to the root chakra. Hematite can help one see the silver lining on every dark cloud and the light at the end of every tunnel. It lends one strength, courage and fortitude for moving through adversity. It is excellent for energetic support of recovery from any ailment of the blood and of blood production within bone marrow. It can work as a strengthener for the liver and can assist in the detoxification process.

These earrings are very pretty-- not too big not too small, just right.  For the price you can't go wrong.  The gift box they arrived in was sort of cheesy, but they were for ME so I didn't mind.  If I were giving them as a gift I'd put them in a prettier box before giving them to the recipient.

Overall very pretty earrings, good value, no complaints

The earrings are gorgeous, kind of a hematite color--but they look darker, nearly black, against fair skin.  Beautiful!  And this COMPANY!  The earrings went on sale after I ordered (and paid for) them and they automatically credited my card/account for the difference.  Wow!  I am *very* happy with this purchase and will definitely buy from Securehoop again

I got this because it was a simple design but still looked good without costing too much.  My only complaint is that my wrists are super small and I had to get links removed, but that was no big deal.  I only wear it when I need to dress up, so it's still in good shape.

I received these earrings as a Christmas gift from my sister.  They are perfect.  Their size is about the circumference of a dime.  Platinum adds elegance and yet, they are perfect for simple everyday wear.  You know they will never tarnish nor will they irritate your ears.  They are also perfect for young lady's first introduction to platinum jewelry.

This is a really nice little pendant/necklace.  The stones are not too small, not too big -- the pendant is about 1" long.  The bail is large enough to accommodate a nice chain (it comes with an 18" fine chain, but you might want to replace it with something a bit more substantial).

For the price, I was expecting something a lot "cheaper" looking.  I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of this.

I purchased this item to show my work to potential buyers. I found that it is effective to show many of my pieces, and the materials used to make this folder is exceptional.  Very professional looking and easy to carry around.  If you have a ton of items then they tend to get tangled, but I don't believe it is intended for that purpose

It comes in a cute and durable box that I now use to store all of my watches.  A perfect gift and good quality.  I especially like the little heart on the minute sweep

I have received many compliments on the Sterling Silver Byzantine Bracelet, 7.5".  It is a nice size (~1/4" diameter).  It is a beautiful link.  It is a really nice peice:  perfect for both casual and formal wear.  The only things I did not like are that the bracelet is not totally cylindrical (it is flat on one side) and some of the links are welded together (not that this really matters because no one can see this).  However, compared to the byzantine bracelet I had had in the past, it is fantastic.  That one kept breaking apart any time it got caught on anything because the rings were not welded closed.  The fact that these are (even if some are welded together) is a fantastic feature

I own about 27 various expensive brands of quartz watches and finally decided it was time to invest in an automatic. I knew stories from other people who own them and claim that it's important to have a good watch winder, so, I saw this one and decided I'd give it a try. I could not see the point in spending hundreds of dollars on a winder when I could use that money towards another watch! :)   I ordered this before I even received my new Invicta Automatic Pro Diver watch.
I have very tiny wrists, and because of that, at first I did not think the spring loader was going to work for me. I struggled a bit to fit my watch in the holder but after about 15 minutes, I got it.  I have been using the watch winder off and on now for over a week and I think it does a great job. My automatic is only 1 minute fast, and although I'm not sure if that speaks more for the quality of the watch or the winder, all I can say is I think the product is doing what it is supposed to do and the watch is keeping time well.
I put it on the winder each night before bed. It's fairly quiet but that is just my opinion. I have read other reviews where people said it was loud. I expected it to be louder than it is.
Like other reviewers, I am unsure of how much is "too much" winding. I think most watches have a built in mechanism that prevents overwinding so I guess putting it in the winder each night is ok.
My only problem now is the lonely empty space where another automatic needs to be since it is a double winder. Hmmmm......time to get another watch!    :)   If you need a winder, get this. It works well and you can save the extra money and get yourself another watch to add to your collection

I purchased this watch winder as part of my husband's Christmas gifts this year to pair with his new Tag Heuer Carrera. I compared this winder to many others out there in all price ranges and this one is actually the same winder many luxury stores (ie. Neiman Marcus) carry, sans branding. It's very quiet and the interval winding keeps his watches running without risking over-winding. 

You can save a lot of money by forgoing the leather wrapping or wood veneer packaging on the more expensive winders and just get this one.

This dual watch winder is awesome.  Not only is it ultra stylish but it works great.  Although I have expensive tastes when it comes to watches, I cannot justify paying more than $100 for a watch winder that no one will ever see.  This dual watch winder works great with my Tag Heuer-Link and my Movado.  It's truly a great buy, no reason to spend more money

I purchased this with a gift certificate for myself.
 For the price you can not complain too much- this necklace is a nice addition to my jewlery box. 
I suppose the more expensive ones may sparkle a bit more but this is a nice piece

I love the watch expecially, with the black white color. Looks the casio of the old, with a modern twist. The watch is very basic in design. A dual digital, fully funtional chronograpgh watch. One other thing; it is very easy to set. The only problem is, it is not back lit. So the digital part of the watch is useless at night (if incase you happen to be doing something in the dark, at night).This is the only disappointing fact about the wrist watch.            You might think a watch that cost $60 will have a self supplied light, but it does not. SAD. SHAME ON CASIO. Apart from that, i love the watch

I have bought this watch for him every 6 years.  He has owned three so far.   After replacing the battery, it is not as water resistant.  Also, the band has broken on two out of the three of the watches.  I gave it 4 stars because of the degradable band.  No other watch has movable bezel, analog and digital time, with an alarm, for under $100.00.

This is a great looking watch.  It is handsome and elegant. The face is large and easily viewed.  The style is easily those you see in $1000+ watches, but obviously does not have the engineering of the more upscale models.  A real bargain for such a handsome watch.

I am very pleased with this product and have had numerous positive comments about how sharp the timepiece looks.  The dial is much larger than most watches but I have big wrists so it was perfect.  The size also gives an updated look.  The only negative comment I have is that the watch is pretty thick and binds on shirt cuffs but that is a minimal problem.  Great reproduction watch

This pendant is small, about the size of a dime, and very light. It is one-sided - the opposite side is hollow. It appears exactly as shown. The chain it comes with is 18", which is pretty standard, and has a circular clasp with the knob you have to pull on

Shpping items like these to an african country will always be scary, but it arrived in very good condition. Nothing was damaged, and the chain and little black pouch was well picked. It was a surprise pendant for my girlfriend, she expected just one item, but this moon was well priced, so I bought it with another pendant. You are lucky to get such beautifully crafted art at this price. It is strong, so no need to worry about breakage during shiping.
I like it, and wish I could keep it, but it was a gift.

Very beautiful pearls. There are visible blemishes, which makes them appropriate to wear at work without me feeling overdressed. The uniformity is very good. All pearls are more or less same size. Beautiful clasps too. However I have to agree with the previous reviewer that it is hard to handle without help, especially the bracelet. Took me about 10 minutes to put it on my wrist. The color is slightly yellowish. The shape is good: kinda semiround rather than potato. They'll make great gifts.

The set is absolutely gorgeous in person, and I'm sure that it will only get better over time as the pearls gain in luster. The clasp is also very beautiful with an intricate design, and it's incredibly secure when fastened; however, it's difficult to maneuver and I can't imagine ever being able to put the necklace on - or get it off - without assistance. That's the only reason I wouldn't give this five stars - the quality and the value of this set are otherwise great

I have recently bought this pair of earing and the matching bracelet for my son's care-giver.  When it arrived my sisters and I were tempted to keep them for ourselves, they were lovely.  I particularly like the make and the feel of the bracelet. They are what I would term "fun" pieces but not in the least suggesting that they are for younger persons only.  I am in my 40s and would enjoy wearing these pieces.
It was a good buy at the sale price.
Oddly enough I also liked the packaging, the items came in a regular protective brown cardboard box that protected the little "gift boxes" on the inside

My husband is very picky. He LOVES this watch. He has gone through a lot of them and loves that it's dressy yet casual and can wear it anywhere. He loves that it's a substantial weight  and the bracelet came extra long. He's 6'2 and "large boned". Had a watch repair shop take a couple links out for only $5. Great investment

I was honestly expecting some cheap necklace that felt like plastic, considering the price.  I was so very wrong! The necklace is gorgeous! The clasp is sturdy and not easy broke.  Package it was mailed in was also very good. I am able to Christmas wrap it in the package provided.  Excellent service.  THANK YOU!!

This is my second one of these winders, so obviously I'm a fan. Winds my Rolexes and a few other ETA autos perfectly, but it doesn't seem to keep my Seiko kinetic diver or Panerais wound sufficiently. Still, as far as I'm concerned, it spreads the lubrication enough to keep the watches in good health. For the price point, this winder cannot be beat and I will purchase more in the future. The auto timer keeps the winder running cool. Fairly silent rotation, depending on the watch. While the gear rotations themselves are completely silent, sometimes there's a slight shift of the watch as it goes around, which makes a repetitive sound. Nothing I can't live with. Highly recommended

I've read all of the reviews . I too own this model . It does what it was designed to do . BURLWOOD is much more ....overpriced ? People sometimes need to be taken by the hand . Especially the overpriveleged . You don't know what it's like to be rich untill you've been poor . AND...you don't know how good your winder is till' you find the proper direction . AS in all things , others are not going to do it for you ALL of the time . BUT in this case I'll make an exception . Some watches wind in both directions...you know - GO BOTH WAYS ? AS do a lot of ....back to the winder lesson , and some only go ONE WAY . Find out what way you need to go and GO THERE !...PROBLEM SOLVED ( help me..this isn't working...oh , PLEASE ! ) The moral too this story is "in a plastic world try not to always have WOOD !! GOD gave you a brain . Read my revie

This watch is a great looking watch and the indigo light gives it all it needs to meet your everyday use.  Because of its gold tone and silver tone band you don't have to worry about what color jewelry you wear with it because it matches it all.  Well worth the price

I wanted a watch with a metal band and a large analog dial. I wasn't quite sure that I would like this watch when it arrived. It was a women's style, but it was larger than I thought it would be. I had to first take it to have some of the links removed, but I was amazed at how light it was when I had it on. I love the easy to read face and the indigo feature is a must for any watch you own. I wear it everyday and I love it. It arrived with a brand new battery and the stem was pulled out so you knew the battery was new. I recommend this watch

I am delighted to get my new Timex watch. It is  even prettier than its picture!  It is easy to set, too.  I bought this watch for its looks and the larger dial, so I am very satisfied.  It will need links removed, but one size just doesn't ever fit all

I really like my new Timex.  It is very classy looking and the face is very easy to read. I like the date feature and the lighted face in the dark. The only drawback was, I had to take it to my jeweler to have some links removed, but the charge was minimal. All in all, good value for the price

My trusty Seiko of 21 years gave out recently (I should really remember to take it off when doing strenuous labor) and I went in search of a similar style.  I received this replacement about a week ago and I love it already.  It's light-weight and easy to read in the light or dark

This watch was purchased as a gift and I was pleasantly surprised when I received it.  The quality is excellent.  I had read in another review that the watch was a little bulky, but I found it to be in line with watches of the same type.  This watch works well with casual and work attire and I was tempted to keep the watch for myself.  In fact I regret not purchasing one for me to keep.  Buy with confidence.

I received this off my wish list from a dear friend and I must say, it's stunning.  It's both delicate and sturdy.  The craftsman's shift is beautiful, in what you would expect a piece to cost four times this amount.  The stone is beautiful and large, without being gaudy.

It's a stunning piece of work.  All you lads out there, should buy this for you lass, and make her very happy!

Wonderful piece I highly recommend for quality and price

It's hard to tell the size of these earrings from the pictures; however, they were about 2x the size that I expected.  I couldn't have found a better gift than these

I bought these earrings for my niece, and after they arrived, I immediately ordered another pair for myself. I find them actually nicer in reality than in the picture. The size is perfect, and the amethysts, although very small, add just a little color accent. I bought them on sale for $15 instead of the usual $50, and I am very, very pleased with what I got for the price

I use this watch both as a daily timepiece and for timing my runs. The ability to turn off the digital display gives it a refined look, even for an Ironman series. I like the catch incorporated into the watch band so it doesn't pull out of the guide (something that used to drive me crazy with my other watches). If you're looking for a sports watch that you can wear out on the town, this fits the bill.

I found this pair of studs to be nice for everyday wear.    They look much better than the ones found in Macy's fine jewelry and they cost less.  Personally I would not go over 1/3 ctw with this quality because the flaws would become obvious.  I am very satisfied with my purchase

My husband has really liked this watch so far.  The price was great for such a elegant looking watch.  He wears it when he dresses up.  He really likes that it is Kinetic.  We don't have to worry about replacing the battery.  The last watch I bought him was a fossil and we had to send it to their servicing center when the battery died and had to wait 4-6 weeks.  The kinetic seems to be working out great

This is a sleek, sharp, quality watch, and the lowest priced model that I've seen in the arctura series. If you can catch it on sale, I think its a great buy. However, be prepared for the weight. This is the heaviest watch I've ever worn, and probably the largest. If you're used to wearing stainless watches, it will probably be fine for you. I'm used to leather bands, and the weight difference is quite noticeable. Wish I could find this watch in titanium, that would be perfect. Overall, if you're not bothered by the large size or weight, it looks great, and I'm sure the quality is also.

I like it beacuse you can hang almost anything from it, and it looks good.
The only downside is that the clasp is too big to get more delicate items on to it.

I love this bracelet but the clasp is seriously defective.  I contacted Sabrina, and they were great about sending me a new one ASAP, with a label for returning the other one.  That was impressive, and such responsive customer service is not to be undervalued.  Still, the clasp is a product defect, and I'm sure one of these days I will probably loose the bracelet b/c it comes undone unknowingly

These earrings are so cute!  They are a great size for a toddler, but probably a little large for a small infant.  It is so hard to find safety back earrings that are cute.  These are a beautiful rose pink color - very sweet.

I rounded up from a 4.5.  The shipping was on time.  It was within the specification advertised, but one of the diamonds is much more yellow than the others, even without a hand lense it is visible.  Other than that I am very happy with the service and product.

Thank You,

We love the watch. It's totally adjustable, press the button for glow-in-the-dark feature. The two lizards "chase" each other around the watch. Too cute

I bought this watch for my husband for his bday. It was a great bargain, very stylish, and he loves it. The only problem we encountered was w/ the so-called "smart link" band.  It was supposedly designed for the customer to resize the band at home, but after numerous failed attempts, we gave up. We Googled it and found several people who encountered similar problems solving the smart link mystery but no one offered a solution. Even the Fossil website was no help. We ended up paying a jeweler who sells Fossil watches $10 to resize the band.  Other than that, my husband is very satisfied with this watch.

I wanted an automatic watch for a while, and I was attracted to the green trim on this model. The watch is big and heavy. This is probably true of most automatics. My issue is that it seems to be too thick. I think the glass/crystal back adds a millimeter or so. 
The band has a slight problem that I can probably fix. Right where the metal of the band contacts the case, one side of the band has bent slightly causing the band to interfere with the rotating bezel. I may have caused this when adjusting the linkage, or it may have come delivered that way. I think I could simply detach the band and squeeze it back into its proper shape. I have actually left it alone as I do not want the bezel to rotate, and the defect is not visible.
As far as accuracy, it seems to have gained about 20-30sec in a week. 
Had I seen the watch in a store and tried it on, I would probably not have bought it. I was not happy when it arrived, but I have worn it for a week, and I am now glad that I picked it.
The only other issue is that I wish the luminous markings were brighter. I purposely picked the black face to be easier to see the markings in the dark (as opposed to the white face), but I have had better luck with other watches

I am a college student and member of the Army Reserve with knowledge of manufacturing/production processes.  I value pieces of fine engineering, precision and design.  I have always admired automatic watches, someday when I can afford one I will purchase an Omega or Rolex.

I can tell that in my particular watch there is a minute dust on the hour hand and on the pendulum.

First off, this watch should be appreciated for what it is, an automatic watch for a reasonable price.  There are no batteries, no electronics, just gears and springs.  Some automatic/kinetic/whatever watches use a pendulum to charge a small battery, these do not interest me.

Pros:  automatic movement, sharp visual appeal, day/date function, supposed shock resistance (haven't beat it up enough to know if this is true but I trust the claim having researched the manufacturing of the movement).  See-thru case back so you can watch the mechanism do its thing!

Cons:  It is not a Rolex, so don't expect perfection.  The band and case are solid but lack the heft, fit and finish of a Rolex level watch.

Bottom Line:  If you want a truly automatic watch for about 100 bucks this is a great choice.  Orient watches and other Invicta models are supposedly are just as good.  You will get compliments on this watch

I am pleased with this watch.  It is inexpensive, yet has a lot of features.    The only negative is that the band is a cloth material and not as easy to keep clean as it would with a leather band.

As I said in my review of the bracelet, (which I bought together), I thought from the pictures that they might be bigger, however my wife was pleasantly surprised.They look much more expensive than they are. This is my first experience with cz but not my last (we're remodling a house). I recommend this seller for their shipping & quality of merchandise

I bought this pair of earrings for myself over a year ago...when they were new to Amazon (no reviews).  I wanted something that looked pretty but didn't cost me a lot.  I loved them....loved them so much that when I lost one down my sink drain, I wanted to buy another pair.  I am currently waiting to receive my second pair.  For the price and the beauty, why not!  No one will know they aren't real diamonds

I purchased this watch on Amazon after looking at the same watch in JC Penny and Dillards for almost $200.00 more. It's a nice casual watch, I wear mine to work as a nurse and its very durable and attractive. The mother of pearl face is a pale pink so it doesn't clash when wearing other colors. For the price, Seiko watches are great, mine usually last about 10 years of frequent wear getting wet regularly.

The watch performs as advertised.

Atomic clock.  I live 2k miles from Ft. Collins and the watch automatically syncs every night, even if I don't put it near a window.

Solar recharge.  The watch arrived with a low battery.  It charged up to full after sitting in the sun for an afternoon.  Since then it has been on full charge with no special actions on my part.

The watch is big and heavy.  I take it off when typing because it slides down to the end of my wrist and knocks against my hand.

The watch's user interface is unintuitive.  This is the first watch I've owned where I had to read (and re-read) the manual to set an alarm or the hourly charm. I find the Timex interface and the old-style Casio interface much easier to use.

In the interests of saving battery power, the alarms are short and quiet.  I can't count on this watch's alarms to wake me up.  It'd be nice if the watch had a power-hog mode with loud insistent alarms and long illuminations.

All in all, I like the watch.  It is nice to have a digital watch that sets its own time and doesn't run out of batteries.  I wish the user interface was more intuitive, the alarms were more effective, and the watch was smaller

The watch arrived in timely fashion and was already set up.  This watch is super.  However, it lacks a timer.  I left the Timex Ironman for this watch.  Timex's quality is horrid (a watch per year) and I changed to the Casion G-Shock based on a recommendation of a friend.  I am glad I did.  If they ever get a timer in this watch I'd buy another

This watch arrived very quickly, and it is a very fine watch.  I had an earlier Casio Ceptor watch and the battery died, I couldn't find anyone to replace it so I needed a new watch.  By the time I had ordered this watch, I actually replaced the battery myself in the old one.  So now I have two atomic watches, but the G-shock is superior by far and is ruggedly sturdy and should last indefinately with the solar power, just be sure to get it to full charge by putting it in direct sunlight until it indicates full charge.  A great deal

I am in the Army and because of that this watch has it's pluses and minuses.  I travel the world, so the multiple time zones is awsome.  The time stamp feature is great for when I need help remember when a specific event happened.  As for the solar power.  It's great in that you don't have to worry about batteries, but most watch batteries last close to five years anyway.  In the Army I find myself doing lots of night missions, and I can go months without seeing the sun because I have to catch up on sleep during the day.  Well, this doesn't really work with a solar powered watch.  I get by, but it can be a hassle some times.  All-in-all, this is a great watch, and if you don't work at night then the solar power won't be a problem for you, except maybe in the winter when you wear coats that cover your wrist.  Just take that into consideration when purchasing a solar powered watch

I bought this as a gift for a friend, and it was the perfect combination of brown leather for casual dress as well as the beautiful simplicity of silver to match classier wear.  Whether you're looking for something casual or more formal, this bracelet wraps it all into one

I never had a problem with mine,I'm a marine and the fact that I went trough    combat with mine and held up made it worth the few bucks I paid for it.I go trough watches like they are made of paper,had this one for 2.5 yrs and other than a lot of scratches it works fine

I'm ;logged in on my wife's accont. I never had problems with the band. I liked the first one so much that after I ran over it with my car, I ordered another. If you think of it as a throw away watch and keep it for two years, you'll love it. It has a very intuitive design, is lightweight and just works

Ditto to all the positive comments on the previous posts. However, I have not had the problems with the bands like the many have mentioned. I've had two of these watches now, going on third as the battery has died on number 2, and I have never had an issue with the bands on my first two. I wear mine all day, every day, even in the pool or shower, and it's held up well. The light did go out seemingly "too soon" but then I notice the battery was beginning to fade as well at the same time. I wear mine all day, every day, in pool and shower, and it's held up remarkably well. The only negative is that it seems the battery goes quickly ... but maybe that's due to using the alarm daily and training with it. 

It is an inexpensive watch (compared to many other options that are out there) and given its ease of use, its very readable face, and sleek look, I'd take the chance on it

This is my second "Sleek 50" -- the first was fine until the battery died, then I tried to put in a new battery (bad idea)and managed to mess up some of the inner workings. 

Highly recommended (the watch -- not changing the battery!

I went out on a limb and decided to surprise my wife with these for Valentine's day.  I purchased the white gold version for her, and to my great astonishment, my wife was pleased by my jewelry choice - a first!

They come in a smallish box, with a smaller felt bag - that holds the tiny earings (the picture in Amazon must be under a micron microscope!).

They are tasteful, and understated

I love, love these earrings. I bought them because I wanted a pair of earrings to wear all of the time. Unless there is something special then I will change for a special occasion. But, these earrings I wear in the shower ---- they are always shinning and they never rust because they are real gold. I received these earrings before the scheduled delivery date

The earrings delivered were as described and will certainly work for me.  I was a bit disappointed in the strength and flexibility of the gold wire.  These earrings were much more flexible that the 25-year-old pair I was replacing.  I doubt that the new ones are as strong and will hold up as well.  However, they do what I need them to do and can be worn around the clock without irritation

I bought a Nighthawk (although one with a leather band) about a year ago and I have been very pleased with it. It looks very masculine and classy, and the style will certainly age well. The slide rule takes a little figuring out, but it's very useful. It keeps time pretty well, too. I've only got a couple of complaints:

The leather band, which I picked because metal bands have always been uncomfortable for me, is a little too large for my wrist. Even when I use the innermost hole in the band, the watch is still kind of floppy. 

For the price, the watch could have a sapphire crystal instead of a glass one. 

Those conplaints are very minor compared to everything I like about the watch. I didn't want to give the watch five stars if I had complaints about it, but my rating would probably be more like 4.75 stars. For the price, it's a great value.

This is my fourth (a fifth, limited-edition is on order) Eco-Drive. I collect a lot of watches but these are some of my favs to actually wear and use. They are the most accurate watches I've ever owned, bar-none.  The Nighthawk is solid, well made, and a delight to wear.  There are few watches on which I'd change nothing, but this is one.  I also got an excellent price and great service.  Many thanks

Threaders are "in" and these are about the most elegant looking threaders I've seen.  The stones are a nice size and it is obvious that it is a butterfly.  It is nice to have such a refined option for such a "hip" style.

I purchsed this watch a while ago and I have to say it is simply great. The animated feature is simply the face switching between red and black which can be set to hold at either color, which is a feature I have found to to very fuctional as it allows for me to switch to the color that better complitments what I am wearing. I have had this watch for nearly a year and it still gets comlpiments weekly. My only criticism comes from the fact that it is not like some of more of the trend watches that have a wide band that actually cuff around the entire wrist, from which this watch takes its styling cues. Nevertheless, it is still a great watch that looks good

I chose this watch because of the stunning, and currently very fashionable, 'Rolex green' colour - and because the price was right. 
So how does it stack up? 
Nice bright yellow display box to keep it safe during shipping and storage, watch was well protected as well with clear plastic wrap over all surfaces. 
The quality and finish are excellent, and the watch is easy to set for day and date. 
It has a clear back, so you can see the motion spring mechanism at work - pretty cool. 
Clasp and strap are well finished and work well - rotating bezel lines up perfectly at 12 O'clock - nice sweeping hand movement. Great look and great value

I love this watch, and I love the price. It looks good both casual and dressy. It goes with just about anything. The people at Invicta are really right in that you should try to match your watch with your belt and such.

The material is high quality. I have large wrists, so it's tricky to get on and off initially because the leather is quite stiff. But it's been loosening and so it's much easier now

I have had this watch for a few months, and so far it has served me well.  It is very solidly built, and has survived a few falls already.  It is accurate enough to get me to work on time.  I do have to wind it about once every week or two, mainly because I don't move my arm enough, I think.  Note that this watch is fairly big (on me anyway) and the strap is quite stiff when new.  It has started to loosen up now that I have had it for a while.  I like the look, and I think it is dressy enough to wear with a suit, but still casual enough that it doesn't look out of place with jeans either.  A reasonable price for a decent watch

I very much like these earrings.  My only reason for not giving them a 5-star rating is that the topaz is quite small.  You really have to look closely to see it.  But, they are excellent quality sterling silver and still beautiful.  I recommend them, just be aware that the stones are tiny

My boyfriend got me this watch for Valentine's Day and it is gorgeous!  The face is very small as other reviewers have indicated, so if the recipient likes smaller face watches (as I do), this is a great gift.  It looks more like a bracelet than a watch; good for small wrists.  Elegant-looking & classy.  I love it!

This is a very nice watch.  It is smaller than it looks in the picture, but I actually like it better that way--it is delicate and lady-like.  The pink face is subdued and the steel band is polished.  It makes a nice dressy or everyday watch.  I have seen similar Seikos in the stores for much more money.

My reaction is quite similar to the other reviewer.  I received my watch a few weeks ago (only took three days) and was impressed by its classy look---all my other casios have been basic black clunkers.  I like that the toggle switches protrude, so it's easy to activate them---those old recessed ones drove me crazy trying to get a nail or golf tee in there. It has all the features I wanted, but I had the same reaction about the alarm.  It's less assertive than the other casios I've had, and I don't think I can trust it to wake me up early or if I'm tired. I've already decided to buy an inexpensive alarm to put by my bed.  Because the screen showing the digital data is small, it's not always easy to read what's on it, especially if the watch hand is partially obscuring the screen, which somehow seems to happen a lot.  The back light only goes on one second at a time, and isn't very strong, so there's a good chance that you won't be able to read the digital screen that quickly.  FYI, the 10 year battery claim is based on using one second of backlight each day, so you better look quick and look sharp----but not often.  So.......great looks, but personality could be better.  That's life

Bought these as a Christmas gift, and think think they are adorable! Great for a second or third hole to add a splash of color. Possibly perfect for a young daughter's first hole. The stones have a very nice sparkle. Wasn't sure if 3mm would be too small, but I think these will do just fine. This set came individually boxed but in a clear plastic holder so that you can easily give as a set, or break them up for individual wrapping. For $49, I'm very satisfied

This necklace is beautiful.  The chain is not skimpy and the heart locket itself is really pretty.  A great alternative to an expensive locket at a fine jeweler.  A true steal at a sale price of under $30.00

I believe the heart shaped locket is a one-of-a-kind thing.  It is appropriately sized to allow for sufficient size pictures while not being too large.  The silver is clean and smooth looking just like the pictures.  Due to the size of the locket, a dainty, smaller chain is sturdy but does not detract from the locket.  Therefore, while I was concerned about the chain size and negative reviews, I took a risk and am happy with this purchase.  The pictures were easy to insert and there is a plastic film to put over the pictures for finger prints and some protection.
Good gift.
Sincerely,
The guy who usually blows it on the Valentine's Day gift.

I had seen the "gold/orange" face version of this Casio watch for years but didn't know it came in black (and white) until I found it on Amazon. I really like the classic good looks of this watch... nice rugged case, smooth-clicking rotating bezel, sturdy band, etc. For &lt;$60, this watch truly delivers awesome quality and value. The digital features are great too. I've received a few compliments from co-workers on this watch already. Overall, an awesome watch for the money and I couldn't be happier with it

I've owned this model for about seven years and I think I'll buy another to keep on standby in case I break the original (I'm not gentle with my watches while working/playing).

Tough, pretty easy to set, good features, and classic "diver" style at a great price. What's not to like? Wouldn't mind having a light on the LCD, otherwise it is proven a great investment.

Battery lasts ~2 years with the alarm going off every day and watch band life is about the same (cracks develop after a while). No corrosion (duh, stainless steel) and good resistance to scratches on the crystal so far.

This is a beautiful watch storage box. Great value. My husband is a watch collector. Plenty of room for the large Invicta and Croton watches. Nice design and color. A must have for anyone with a extensive watch collection.

My husband has become an avid watch collector so I gave him this box for Christmas. The design of the box is as attractive as its contents. My husband says that it is easy to use too. From the looks of things I will have to get another box for his ever increasing collection

Beautiful box to hold most of my watches.  Have two other watch boxes that hold 11 watches ea and some rings.  This box holds those watches in less space!  Having no place for the rings is not a minus in my opinion.  Nice being able to see 10 of my most worn watches at a glance!  Another 10 in the drawer below.  If you have several watches that you want to put in a nice looking, good quality box you will not go wrong buying this item

I bought this watch a couple months ago and it is superb. It IS a BIG watch but I am a big man and it looks quite hansom on my wrist,but if your not a big guy I woudnt recommend this model. Now onto the timekeeping.When I received the watch it ran a bit fast (30 sec. daily) so instead of waiting the 6 weeks to sent it to Seiko for repair, I took it to the local Seiko dealership/jeweler and had them regulate it for $30, well worth the money and now it runs great. This watch is an absolute tank, I wear it every day, it gets banged around quite a bit, and there has yet to be even the slightest scratch in the hardlex crystal.

I love this watch,
  I thought by looking at the pictures and reading other comments that it was going to be big and bulky. I was immediately surprised at how light it was. It is easy to read and keeps good time. It is also a very handsome watch. The rotating bezel is a quick and easy way to time anything (lasting less than a hour). Highly recommended!

Oddly, the SKX175 I received is actually a SKX009K! What a steal at $129!

The watch is a 5-star based on price alone. But the jubilee bracelet gets a 1-star!! It's cheap feeling and loose. The center links are fold-over, NOT solid. At this price though, it's not surprising that something got cheaped out like that.

Overall, I give it a 4-star rating. Missing tag!!! False advertising (perhaps to the benefit, as the 009K is perceived a little better) that it's really a SKX009K rather than a SKX175 (has Singapore labeling on lower edge of dialface, whereas the SKX009K does not have any country markings). Great buy for sure!!

cheers

This watch is a classic. I have no issues with it losing minutes. i am very tough on watches, i never take them off, and this watch has been a real tank. i was needlessly worried that the red and blue dial would chip or be scratched off. i am amazed that it has not b/c i have accidentally scraped, smashed it into doors, walls etc...same for the dial, tough as diamonds. it is a BIG watch, so it may not be for everyone, but if you like the styling, it is a steal. and the seals will never weaken b/c it will never be opened to change a battery. i am very impressed

These are very well crafted little earrings. I love how they look, and the price just can't be beat! These have made me want to buy many more things from Silver Insanity! The only problem I did experience with these earrings is that the post is rather long, and it pokes the side of my head when I sleep. Otherwise, I couldn't love them more!

As a tarantula keeper (I have 5 at home), I always try to look for unique items such as these. Caution- they are really tiny! I've already lost one of them. (Guess it scurried away)
It's nice to see that they actually look like tarantulas and not true spiders

PROS:
The blue topaz stone is beautiful with great quality and great cut.
The white gold is a perfect choice to combine with the blue of the stone and the diamonds.
CONS:
the chain is kind small and thin.
the diamonds are tiny with less than good quality.
OVERALL:
I am a pleased customer.
I bought it as a gift for the Topaz stone not for the diamonds or the chain.
By the way she looks stunning with this necklace

needed a gift for my mother in law who has everything; including great taste.  she collecgts the swarovski figures but didnt have any of their jewelry.  i came upon this accidentaly and took a chance on ordering it.  it arrived promptly; in time for Christmas; and it is very stunning.  not gaudy at all; just classic style beauty.  could probably be worn to her office each day (upscale casual) or if she is dressed up.   the price absolutely could not be beaten for what you are getting.  i liked it so much i wanted to get one for myself; and i am not a huge jewelry fan

This product has helprd me to easily open the back of my watch and replace the battery.  I am sure it will satisfy me when I want to change the battery on my more expensive watch that has the back that screws on.  But also since I have "N" scale model trains the tweezers and small tools have been most helpful. i.e pliers, hammer, etc

This is a good collection of tools that you should have if you want to do minor watch repairs at home.  I had 5-6 watches lying around and I could not use them coz they ran out of battery.  Was able to open all of them with tools in this kit.  It doesnt have any user guide but if you have used tools then you will be able to figure out where to use what and how.  The quality of products is pretty good too .. at least nothing broke during fixing 5-6 watches yet.

I am very happy with the purchase.  The hammer was missing from the kit and when I called the customer service, they immediately sent me the hammer

This is an excellent tool set for beginners. The quality of the tools is not professional grade, but more than adequate for the hobbyists. For the price you pay, this is an excellent deal. A little more money than some of the other kits being sold on Amazon.com, but well worth it as you get a complete set

I bought this necklace because it was very on sale, and I was surprised by how much I loved it when it arrived. The beads are actually somewhat darker than they appear in the picture, which looks nicer and is easier to match to an outfit. It's a bold necklace, but it can dress down quite a bit with the right blouse

I was browsing through Amazon when I came upon Nvie jewelry and I absolutely love it! I bought this necklace for my mom for her birthday, but had a hard time not keeping it for myself. The necklace was really nice, well constructed, and it was shipped quickly. It looked just like the picture, but I have a feeling that each piece of jewelry is truly one-of-a-kind.I would recommend Nvie Designs to anyone for buying really lovely, affordably priced jewelry.

The watch is very pretty, sturdy enough for everyday wear and elegant enough for dressy occasions.  Excellent price and fast delivery.  I like the dual tone watch band, because I wear both white and yellow gold.  The gold isn't as brassy as what shows in the picture.  Excellent value

Very nice piece, just beware of the size, it's much bigger than it appears in this picture.

It does hang nice on the silver cord, however, the clasp is backwards, and with the cord, it does not flex to the correct position.

I just received this today.  Somehow I completely missed that the pendant is on a silver-wrapped wire and not a chain.  Had I noticed that, I probably would not have ordered this piece - and I would have missed out.  It is very nice.  It has a nice weight to it - not too heavy, but substantial.  The wire lays on my neckline just right, and the pendant looks beautiful. I'm very pleased with it.

This is a beautiful piece. Very substantial and unusual! The only thing that would have made it better is if it had been made with a bigger bail so it could accommodate larger chains than the neckwire it comes on. Regardless, it was well worth the price

This Invicta is a great watch if you are looking for a giant size timepiece with a touch of elegance.  It is well designed and the fit and finish is good.  The Citizen automatic movement is a workhorse and very reliable.  When you open the box, this watch will impress you and everytime you wear it, it will be noticed.  It is not for the timid.  Comments and more information can be obtained through the www.invictawatchforum.com.  See what others think and general watch information

I have had this watch for two months now.  I have been working hard for these couple of months banged the watch around.  It is still scratch free.  Working outside on the car and the battery fully charged. and has stayed that way since.  Of course I was not working under the hood that day.  This watch is very bulky and although you should not work under the hood with a watch on it would be really bad.  The watch comes a full .75" above the wrist.  
The atomic part works great.  I live in Delaware and my home seems to be in a void of most radio wave, yet I get an update while I am sleeping with the watch on.  
Simply, a tough bulky watch that should not have any trouble getting the atomic time and charging the battery.  The LCD is to small to use any of the other features,  except maybe the alarm, but dont get this watch for any other features

I received these earrings as a gift, and I don't know what they are made of, but I get an awful lot of compliments on them.  They seem to change color in response to what I am wearing.  I would definitely order other Silver Insanity items

I have two pairs of earrings from this company and they look amazing.  I can't tell if they're plastic or glass but they really do look as beautiful as in the picture, and I always get compliments when I wear them.  Sometimes people ask me what stone they are, they can't even tell it's synthetic!!  No bubbles or anything like the bad review here says

These earrings are perfect to wear every day: 

* they are comfortable to sleep in - no need to take them off in the evening

* they are small and classy - will look great with any outfit

They are exactly what I was looking for, and I'm really happy with them.

To help you see the size of these earrings and how they look on someone's ear, I've uploaded an image of this earring in my ear - see it in "Customer Images"

I am pleased with the watch. It is flashy and keeps good time.  However, I am still trying to figure out why it stops from time to time.  I think I inadvertantly push a button that stops it.  It is a small annoyance but has happened 4-5 times in the last month

I've been through generations of digital watches with plastic bands. My wife thinks they look nerdy but I like the alarm and other gadgets. I'm tired of wearing these things out though and wanted something that looked nicer. This is a very nice looking, sturdy watch which was what I wanted. It also has the window with the digital time, date, alarm, etc. My only complaint is that that window is tiny and not easy to see. Also the light for night viewing is wimpy. The watch works fine and is very nice looking but I wish the window were a bit larger. 

One year later the digital window keeps setting it self back to Jan 1 and 12:00 noon. Poor quality. Look elsewher

This is the second of these watches that I have owned.  I'm tough on watches and I had the crystal replaced on my first one but it leaked and moister got inside - still runs fine, just tough to see.  The flat crystal on this watch could be just a hair more recessed and then there would be little chance of chipping it on the edge.

This watch has an LCD that supports an alarm, its own time separate from the dial, stop watch, and date.  This combo is getting more difficult to find but is ideal for traveling and keeping the dial on home time and the LCD on local time (so alarm goes off relative to local time).  To find this in a Seiko or similar watch you will spend north of $100 and more like $200.  Getting this watch for $70 with free shipping was a no brainer.  I paid $110+tax or so for the first one five or six years ago in a department store

But no calories count.

I love this watch despite that, it's well designed, the chest strap also links to the machines in the gym (most that say POLAR ready).. so that was a great surprise

The chest strap has a battery that is user-serviceable as well as the watch, so you don't have to send it to the manufacturer (like the POLAR HR).

Overall I think is a good buy, but the is missing the calories count, that would be my only upgrade.

Are you tired of replacing watch batteries?  Do you bump into things with your watch?  If so, buy this one.  It's a beautiful, practical watch that's available at a very good price.  It winds itself mechanically as you move your wrist about.  No batteries.  It's shock- and water-resistant.  Bang it around, swim with it, wash dishes with it, shower with it.  No problem.  It's gold-plated stainless steel, with a gold-plated stainless steel band.  It's beautiful.  It's big, so if you have small wrists, buy the ladies version,  If not, buy the men's version.

The review below by "Owen Wilson" is pretty funny.  He never took it out of the box, and it stopped running, so he returned it.  LOL!  It's an automatic watch, dude!  You have to wear it to wind it, or it stops.

ANYways, I've had mine for about 4 months now and barely ever take it off.  It keeps excellent time, gaining only a second or two a day.  I really like having this wonderful piece of classic technology on my wrist, I like the size and substantial weight of it, and it's very comfortable to wear.

I took a star off the rating because the original strap developed an unpleasant odor after a couple of weeks, which no amount of scrubbing would remove.  I replaced it with an after-market Italian rubber strap.  3 months later the new strap still smells pleasantly of vanilla, which I guess is a common additive in real rubber straps.  Who knew?  The original strap looked a bit beefier and more diver-like, but the new strap has a deployment clasp which is handy.

Occasionally I wish I had bought the SKX007 instead, as I like the look of the round markers, but it hasn't bothered me much that these are square, and I prefer the second hand on this watch.  I really like the way SAT is blue and SUN is red - reminds me it's the weekend.

This is my first modern automatic and overall I'm very happy with my purchase.

Lovely little apple charm.  Just what I wanted.  Picture a little deceptive, though.  I thought the charm would be larger than it actually was.  Otherwise - Great item.  I'm happy

The 30 reviews before mine gave pretty complete description about the watch. I'll just say it fits very well on my relatively small wrist.
If you like the watch but think it won't fit well because you have small wrist. Don't worry, it fits just fine. Enjoy.
After wearing this watch for few weeks, I realized I am just like many others, wearing the Calibre 2100 exclusively now.

Overall, the product is great.  I have had the watch for nearly three months now and have had no problems with it.  The quartz movement is very accurate, the chronograph works very well and i use the alarm every day.  The only drawback is that you have to reset the date on months that are less than 31 days.  Otherwise this watch is fantastic and with the eco-drive, you never have to worry about repacing the battery.  And the titanium version is so lightweight that you hardly notice that you are wearing a watch

I got this watch some couple of months ago and absolutely loved it. It looks,feels and functions really good and got lots of positive comments from my peeps. Now for the reason i cant get give it a 5-Star (i really wish i could); IT DOES NOT HAVE PERPETUAL CALENDER. i was looking for a watch with all of the 2100 qualities and also with perpetual calender. I hate the fact that i have to manually adjust my watch and painfull enuf, i have to leave with this flaw.

If you dont mind a watch without a perpetual calender then you would love this watch and literally bite the finger off of anyone that puts their finger on it but i want a watch with perpetual calender and this doesnt not fully cut it for me.

I have banged my watch against all kinds of hard surfaces and am pleased to say that this thing is built tough.  Everytime I've accidentally hit it against a counter top or wall, I worry that I might've scratched it, but everytime (knock on wood) it's come out clean.  Another good thing about this watch is that it's light.  For a big watch, it doesn't weigh me down like a stainless steel model.  I've gotten many compliments on it.  I love it

This watch is beautiful.  I cannot say enough good things about this watchs design.  Its 45mm face is bigger than most watches but doesnt look gawdy, it keeps perfect time and is very light weight.  I bought the Calibre 8700 before this one and I love both of them but I would give this one a slight edge.  My two small complaints are that this watch doesnt have the perpetual calender which is a very nice feature that the Calibre 8700 does have, and also that this watch uses mineral crystal for the face and not Saphire.  I am sure the crystal used is scratch resistant but it is no where near as resistant as Saphire crystal would be

This item is exactly as advertised. Well designed, well made, and heavy. My only complaint (and the reason for the 4 stars) is that the chain is way to short. I knew this when I ordered it so I had other arrangements made, but a 26" or 28" chain would be much better, in my opinion, than a 20". Great value for the money, however

This is with out a question one of Timex's Best watch. I dont know what the the band problem these other watch owners are talking about! Band has normal life span and is VERY EASY to change! Has plenty of room to get to the pins if you need to change the band. Good job Timex and Amazon!!!!!!
Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This was my first fossil watch I usually buy Burberry or D&G, but I was so hard for me to tell time on the watches so my friend told me to buy a fossil, so I did and I love it is so stylish and cute. I love the way it changes color from different angles

This is a really fun and fashionable watch.  It has a bangle style band and can be worn slightly loose or snug.  I like the pink dial that changes color.  Depending on the angle and lighting, the dial looks pink, yellow or purple.  I also like how Fossil made the band adjustable.  Remove or add as many links as necessary.  There is no need to have the watch adjusted at the jewelry counter

this watch is automatic, has a sapphire crystal and is invicta, what more can u ask? and all this for just $200.

the piece is heavy, u can taste the quality by holding it, the movement can be seen in the front and back, one of the better looking movs. iv ever seen. i own 7 automatic watches, 3 of them are invictas, but this have the coolest movement inside, it holds the charge up to 3 days and mine only losses 3 minutes in a week.

buy this watch is very very reliable.

A nice moderately priced chain that is very pretty. It is fine, delicate chain and the serpentine pattern has a spiral look to it. The are reflective areas that shimmer every 1/4 inch or so. I am using with a large cubic zirconia pendant and it is quite stunning. The chain feels strong and less likely to tangle. Great purchase for the price

As a field engineer I have to work with tools inside machinery.  More often than not I keep my watch and I have had several scratched watches in the past. So I was somewhat skeptical to wear a nice watch like this but the price seemed right to give it a try. After 9 months of using it daily, this watch has still not a single scratch. The quality is very good and it really looks better than on the picture

Due to my employment I travel extencively, this time piece has in the short time I have owned it forefilled all the requirements I require of a functional time piece at a very competetive price. I would recommend Pulsar as a manufacture to any body reqiring quality and style. At this moment in time I have 4 Pulsar time pieces that I use on a regular basis, 3 are working /daily use sports watches and I have a dress watch for when I am entertaining / partying. None of these watches have ever let me down, I have them regularly, serviced and new seals every time the batteries are changed, regular diving and swimming trips have never caused any problems. My one slight critisium would be the digital read out on this model is a little pale and could do with slightly altering the contrast, however it remains an excellent time piece - Highly recommende

I've had the watch for a week now and I'm very happy with it. Both digital and analog time are exact to the second after a week (checked against Apple network time server). The watch looks good and I can't say I've had a problem with the digital display - if it was brighter I think it would tend to be distracting. The slide rule looks good but I doubt more than 1% of buyers will actually use it. One small negative point I have noticed is that although the hands are luminous the hour markers aren't, which makes things a little tricky in complete darkness - a silly oversight, hence 4 stars. Overall though, well worth the money

You can pay hundreds more for the same product, but why?  This watch has everything th emore expensive brands do, but it costs much less.  It is not a cheapy either, it still has the Pulsar durability, and usefulness.  Great buy

I purchased this watch for three reasons: 2 time zones, backlighting, constant display of day of week/month & day.  Did not disappoint. Looks cool. I bought this watch on the basis of the other earlier reviews -- very accurate account of the features and performance.  I wear it for everyday use

this is probably one of the lightest/smallest watches with an interval timer feature, which is why I got it.  It's also pretty cheap.  It has a decent number of other options as well.  This particular seller had the cheapest price with the most recent model.  very quality

I love this watch. It's perfect for swim workouts and aquathlon races -- takes splits, can do intervals, etc. I use a different product with a heartrate monitor for my runs, but can't use it for my swims (since heartrate monitors can't transmit under water, and also, the unit itself is not waterproof). This Timex has an audible chime under water, and it's easy to set the various functions. It stores your workout splits so you can recall them later when logging your workout. I also love the 3 alarms - my schedule is different every day, so I use the alarms to remind me when to leave work for school, when to leave to pick up my son, etc. I had lost my first watch (same model), but never found another watch that had all the features I wanted for a reasonable price. This is my second one!

This is the 4th or 5th watch in this series that I've owned. This one allows for multiple interval timing. Fantastic! 

I 'did' the Chicago marathon this past fall. The group that I train with runs for 3 minutes and then walks for 2 minutes on all of our training runs. This watch alternates these intervals, sounding an alarm after each! The buttons are intuitive, making it easy to use even with quite a few features.

The silver and black color combo has held up much better another black and metallic green Timex watch from another line did (The metallic green on the watch face scraped off). The band has openings which is nice (your wrist doesn't get sweaty). Good value

I've used this model watch for the past three years of my cross-country career and have thoroughly enjoyed it.  It's very light and not bulky at all - something every runner looks for in a watch.  Along with that, the interval timer really comes in handy when doing timed work outs or when  simply doing crunches.  The fit is so comfortable and does not cut or chafe.  Also, the battery life is outstanding (+ 1 year).  

Though, I have had a few issues.  I broke off the band that keeps the excess watch strap in place - though that may be my own doing from the roughness of the sports I play.  Also, I've had to return the watch for a replacement due to water damage.  Sure, it was covered by the warranty - but it's still a hassle to deal with if the problem comes up - though, I've only experienced this when steam gets into the watch or while swimming in high pressure circumstances - like when diving.  

That being said, when I lost the watch - I immediately replaced it with the same model.  If you're looking of a light, sleek, and versatile watch this will definitely do.

I ordered these earrings knowing they would be small.  If my ear holes had been a bit more toward the edge of my earlobe they might have fit.  These earrings are *really tiny* and do not fit me.  I need the next higher up size. These are like 3/8 inch, way small for me and also way difficult to even bend/manipulate to open the hoop

I ordered these earrings thinking they'd be as round as the picture seems to imply.  They're really nice but honestly, they're not as round as they look in the image, which I found a tad disappointing at first.  They're not totally flat or anything like that but the drops look a bit "flatter" in person than they do in the picture.  I'm not blaming Amazon or Silver Insanity for it since they've done nothing wrong.  Products can look different in pictures than in person due to things like light and camera angles.  I just want to give notice to people who buy these earrings.  And yes, they are a substantial piece of jewelry as the previous reviews imply, but not so big that they're distracting or gaudy or overly heavy.  They're very nice.

These are my favorite earrings: I wear them constantly. They are unique and jazz up even the most utilitarian outfit. They are a bit larger than you might anticipate,and it is a size I really like but which might overpower some. The picture, at least on my monitor, is about life-sized

For the price this watch can't be beat.  Very thin, very light, and it gets quite a few comments.  I am anxious to see how the crystal holds up as apparently Skagen is notorious for fragile crystals.  At $75, however, I won't be that upset if it has to be replaced.  Overall an excellent buy for the price and no pulling of the arm hair

I have skin allergies, and was not able to find a watch that I could have on my skin until I found this watch. The price of the watch could not be beat, for the chance that I could not have it on. 
Thank you for suppling a great watch.

I'm a picky person when it comes to watches. And I'm very rough with them. This watch has far exceeded my expectations on all accounts. Its so light I often forget I'm even wearing a watch. I've gotten several comments on it as well. The only negative thing I can say about this watch is that the mesh material of the band is difficult to get water out of. I useally take mine off to wash my hands. 

Overall its a good looking, well made, tough time piece

This was my first watch that was over $100 dollars. I was just getting into watches and wanted something that looked great and would stand the test of time. This watch is beautiful. The polished look won't last forever if worn daily, but even when battle-scarred this watch still looks classy. I love that battery replacement is pretty much a non-issue with this watch. Its titanium design makes it so light and comfortable that you might forget you are wearing it. The dial window is pretty resilient, but I would not test that too much. This is for the most part a dress watch. I also have an Invicta Abyss automatic diving watch that I wear occasionally, but I don't wear it nearly as much as I wear my Citizen.
My Citizen is my favorite watch of all time. Its versatility and longevity have impressed me in the three years that I have owned it. I recommend this watch for anyone who wants a beautiful watch that is dressy and still practical for most daily life. I always get compliments about it also. 

This watch is a good buy.

I have owned this watch for nearly 3 years now, and it has been wonderful.  It looks great, I have never had to replace the battery (according to Citizen, I never will either), and it keeps perfect time.  The clasp is very easy to operate and it fits very well.  It is definitely the lightest watch that I have ever owned.  I only have 2 gripes, one small, one could be a killing point for some people.  

The small gripe is that the crown (used to change the time/date/day) is a bit difficult to pull out to the correct position to move the date (for months with less than 31 days).  You have to pull it only halfway out (pulling it out fully will allow you to set the time), but it has a tendency to go past that to fully out or fully closed.

The larger gripe is that this watch scratches VERY easily.  I use the computer everyday for extended periods in my job.  Because of this, the bottom of the band has been scratched considerably on my desk which leaves dark grey marks on my desk and scratches on the band.  I have also scratched the metal part of the bezel just by bumping into something.  Titanium is nice and light, but probably not the best metal for a watch, especially if you plan on wearing it on a daily basis (even in an office environment)

I got the watch off Amazon for a birthday gift and I must say I'm impressed. It looked good in the picture here, and it looks even better in person! I read about the arm hair pulling problem and I don't have any problems but that's probably because I'm only 15 and I'm Asian so my arm hair isn't exactly long so I have no answer to that. My arm is only about 2.5 or so inches wide so I'm skinny needless to say, and the watch still fits me fine after removing some links. Time is accurate from what I can tell, but I had a little trouble setting the date, wouldn't turn past Thursday at first though I got it to by fowarding the time to the next day. I don't know if it's a problem or not since I haven't read the guide yet. Another thing I'm impressed by is the fact that this watch is solid titanium. Even in the middle of the links. Many cheaper watches are hollow inside the links, but not this one, it's solid titanium all the way through. As others have said, the markers really are very bright in the dark, I tested it in a completely dark room and I was able to tell the time with no trouble at all. I would recommend this watch for anyone looking for a stylish watch that's not too pricy. It's great for everyday wear so don't hesitate if you think it's too formal. If I, a 15 year old thinks it's not too formal, it probably isn't :). Hope this helps some of your decisions

We got these earrings for our daughter on her 6th birthday. She loves jewelry and especially earrings. The color is a little pale, the actual earrings aren't quite as pink as they look in the picture. But they are good quality and look great. My daughter wears them all the time.

This was a good buy. These earrings are great for anyday wearing or with evening wear. They look very stylish

I was more than pleased when I received this pendant! It has a nice feel and you actually know it's there, instead of it feeling like a good wind would carry it away. You have to look extremely close to see the peridot in the setting, but that is all I have to complain about! Definitely worth your money

I ordered this watch initially as a gift for someone, and when I received it, I loved the look and feel of it so much that I quickly ordered another just for myself.  It's a very sleek looking watch, very lightweight on your wrist, and the price on Amazon here is at lear 40% below what I have seen it go for regular retail price in the more upscale stores in the malls.  I intend to use this watch for special occasions as I believe it will complement dressier attire.

This watch looks incredible. The case is solid titanium and the mesh band is tiny stainless steel links infused with titanium. It really can go with anything. You could wear it with khakis, jeans, a suit, pretty much anything because the color is so versatile. If you're looking for a quality watch, that looks good, and for a really good price well look no further

This is a great watch. The clasp is easy to adjust and takes only 10 minutes to adjust. It was shipped well before the estimated time and is in perfect condition. Well made and light, it's extremely slim. SO if you really like heavy watches, this may not be your choice. Otherwise it is perfect for everyone

this is the best watch if you consider following things: 
1. Looks: the color of dial and the feeling of dial on hands is really beautiful. 
2. Size and thickness: If you search for slim watches, skagen will be your first and final choice. 
3. Mesh Band: This type of band is the speciality of skagen. its un-comparable. 
4. Price: Considering the price for overall quality this watch is really affordable.

Bottom Line: Everyone will notice and appreciate about it.

I was searching for a watch for weeks, saw a picture of this watch and paused. Intrigued  I began to read the specs: alarm, chronograph, thermometer, light, stopwatch, world-time zones and more, what's the catch? $55USD C'mon seriously with all those features is that all? I was still skeptical but when I got the watch & put it on my wrist I was sold. Solid, well crafted, unique sporty/elegant combination. My only gripe is that slight increase in body temperature can give an innacurate room temperature. We can't have the world but CASIO has come close with this price I can honestly say go for it

this watch has it all at a nice price, the display is kind of dark and the band sacrifices some of your hand-hair if u have and i doubt that u don't have, else is a masterpiece, all stainless steel, even base, thermomener and a smart cronograph, plus 3 yrs battery, this is my favourite, no other watch has this price/quality proportion. try it and u will be satisfied, sporty but looks elegant too

I love the look but was a little unhappy with the quality of the small melee diamonds used around the dial of the watch.  They are very milky and personally, I think the watch would look better without them at all if that's the only quality they had.  
Great looking and I'm glad I finally bought it for myself.

I had been looking at this particular watch for over a year and simply did not want to spend the money on it.  I found it at Amazon.com for half the price I had seen in department stores so I decided to buy it.  It is a fabulous watch.  I look forward to wearing it each day.  It looks great with really dressy suits or jeans and a top.  It is a great piece.

I purchased this Bulova watch as a Christmans gift for myself, this past christmas '06. I have a small watch collection & I hadn't really bought such an elegant watch before, so I decided why not? Specially when I researched the price on how much I would save by buying it on Amazon.  By looking at the pics on Amazon it looked so nice, but when I received it  was the most BEAUTIFUL watch I had seen or owned. The diamond bezel is just right it isn't to much glitz nor is it too little, the diamonds are just right & amazing they sparkle so beautifully against the chronograph face & the stainless steel band. The watch itself is a little heavy compared to other watches I own so it is definitely sturdy & above all just a well made timepiece that I am sure will be, not just in my collection but on my wrist for years to come.

I rec'd this today.  I had been looking for a while for a white faced stainless watch and kept coming back to this one from Bulova. (I looked for nearly two years!)  I did some looking around online and in stores and Amazon by far had the best price (they beat everyone by at least $100), so I did what any girl would do, I bought it.  

It is a substantial watch. It's not a watch for someone looking for something dainty or unassuming. I don't think it's heavy, it just feels like you've got a watch on.  I personally like the size and weight.  I plan on this being my spring/summer watch until it dies or something happens to it.  I have a Seiko Coutura with a black MOP face w/diamonds that I love, but I wanted something different but sort of the same and this one was it.

These earrings are very pretty; I'm very pleased! Nice faceting and sparkle. The stones are a medium/bright green with a little yellow and brown mixed in, which only seem to make the stones more intriguing and beautiful. The peridot stones in these earrings are the prettiest I've owned so far. Highly recommend

They sparkle well and look as good as anything else I have seen at the mall stores.  I like the non-cup style studs, as I think they allow more light to flow through the stone.  Save your cash and get these.  She will be very happy and you can spend the extra money on fishing lures or something.  ;-)

DO NOT go to Jared's jewelers if they are near you...they are evil people.

As soon as I saw this watch I had to get it.  I loved it because it had really nice details and the butterflies are beautiful.  It's a really nice looking and good quality watch.  The only problem I do have with it is that the face is quite big.  If you have a small wrist it is very large.  I still love it and would never return it but feel like it could be a lot smaller.

I just got this watch as a Christmas present.  It is gorgeous.  The only thing is it's a little bigger than I would like it to be.  The face is so femanine, but the size makes it a little masculine.  The face is about an inch and a half in diameter, and the band is a little over a half inch wide.

Because it is SO pretty I am keeping it, however if you prefer a small dainty watch, maybe this one isn't for you.  My friends are telling me bigger watches are "in" now so maybe they're right??

This is my second Skagen watch. My first one, which was almost identical to my new one, lasted ten years of daily use. I love the two-tone combination of gold and stainless steel. My only disappointment is that, at a glance, it is difficult to tell the minute hand from the second hand. I think the hour and minute hands should be slightly more heavier than the second hand. Otherwise, I love the profile design of this watch including where the comfortable mesh band meets the watch face

- Not too good for a small hand. Though it is possible to adjust the bracelet to different sizes, on a small hand there will be a long part of the band left (under the "top layer"). It is difficult to make this part invisible, as it tends to come from one of the sides.
- The clasp is tight. Hope it will be easier to open and close after some usage.
- The combination of the brushed metal dial and the golden hands makes it difficult to read, especially in dim light.
- The golden "piece" is actually just a thin film layer on the inner side of the glass.

I'm delighted with my Skagen watch as I was with the previous one I lost.  I find the clean, modern design makes me feel elegantly turned out.  The analog dial is easy to read.  The mesh band is easy to adjust to my wrist size.  The silver color coordinates with my silver jewelry

This bracelet is very simple and elegant. The pav cz has a great sparkle, but isn't overboard. I also like the fact that it's a rolo bracelet--the links are delicate and small, but very sturdy and have a nice gleam to them. Furthermore, the charm "O" is a nice style and doesn't look gaudy. There are some tiny little dots on the back of the charm (not so sure what those are all about).

This bracelet looks great stacked on top of my silver bracelet watch. Wearing any bracelet can make it hard to type, but this one is cool because you can actually peg it nice and tight to your wrist by wrapping the "stick" part of the clasp beneath the rolo chain if you want it out of the way. 

I get compliments every time I wear this bracelet; so, it's nice that it supports a good cause since it does get noticed. Obviously, if you're looking for fine jewelry, this might not be your choice, but as they say, "Diamonds are forever, but CZ is for right now." ;-)

I would recommend this for those in their teens, but even for women in their twenties and thirties who like the whole sterling-silver bling-thing. Also, definitely recommended for those interested in supporting good causes such as ovarian cancer awareness.

I selected this stopwatch from the many others simply because it has the indiglo feature, and I need to operate in subdued lighting.
Other advertised features are similar to many other stopwatches. 
In use, I have found it to be quite satisfactory. The readout is clear and large enough to be read at a glance. I have not had the need to explore all of the features, but it does all that I would like it to do quite well. There is a short learning curve, but not insurmountable.
If night vision is an issue, this is the only one.... if night vision may be a requirement in the future, it is still the only one. Otherwise, it performs at least equally as well as any others available.

I bought this as a memento of a brilliant but modest necklace I had seen at the Smithsonian Institute.  I love the grand central stone as well as the modern multi-strands of this design - this combination truly illuminates my evening wear.  By far, the intricate detail present reminds me of the jewelery owned by ladies of the royal court.  With so much class it is still affordable.  This necklace is an exceptional gem.

I am pleased with the watch.  It syncs with the big clock in Colorado every morning at midnight.  We also have a wall clock at home which does the same thing and the difference between the 2 is no more the 1 second at worst.  For $40 you can't go wrong.  Only complaint is my wrist is in between removing 1 or 2 links from the watch band so I chose 1.  It rides a tad lose on my wrist but 2 links would make it too tight.  Guess I need to lose a couple more pounds so I can take another link out!

I came across this watch on a Friday sale at well over half off, a great price. The features were more than adequate for telling time; dead on accuracy, plus date and day. I figured setting the watch couldn't be too difficult, there are only two buttons, so I purchased it with a gift card, totally painless.

The watch arrived a few days later and I had it programmed easily within 5 or 10 minutes. The watch band is pretty long so I had to remove a link from each side to fit, no special tools are needed. While traveling, setting the time zones is easy as city codes around the world are listed on the back. The wave ceptor function works fine in Boston and in Europe.

I usually wear more expensive watches than this, but this one looks great,  much better than in the picture. The specs say it has a metal case, but it doesn't. It has resin buttons, case, and back, but with some metal cladding. The band is all metal

This is probably one of Casio's least expensive Wave Ceptors. It synchs every day indoors in a watch case that's not by a window. The digital display shows the day, date, and other info such as which time zone, what time it synched. I'm just concerned that the analog, digital display, and receiving every day will make it a battery eater. It's available in different dials, but the blue seems to be the most common. I give it 4 stars because the luminous paint is not very bright. And the crystal is acrylic-scratches easily. But that's not really an issue because I have about 15 watches, and this one gets very little wrist time

Overall, this watch is good: 
  large numbers
  fairly standard set of basic features (date, alarm, stop watch)
  crown seems fairly resistant to scratching
  Indiglo lighting is great

Contrary to the description, however, the chronograph does NOT have a lap capability; it only has a split function (2 way).

As a reminder, it does not have a countdown timer, which seems to be a common theme for many Timex watches

I ordered one of these for the time I spend in the gym and on the track running, also it is a good choice if you go swimming every once in a while.

Of course, for that price you are not getting a professional sports watch like the Omega's Seasmaster, but for occasional use it's just great. It has all you need - stop watch, alarm, the nice light that Timex calls Indiglo, etc. It also comes with a black plastic strap that feels good and unlike leather is really "water-friendly". Anyway, who needs a 50m water-resistant watch if the strap can "survive" nothing more than a splash of water.

As far as accuracy - so far it's OK. I had it for 4 months now and I had to adjust it only once -- it was 2 seconds behind.

It doesn't have the fancy functions that you would find in the Casio's G-Shock series, like address book that stores 50 names and numbers or a sophisticated stop-wtach that can split times or measure per lap time, nor it has an altimeter, but then again you can get it for less then $20.

Overall, I give this nice Timex 5 stars - it's a great value watch for occasional use

Swarovski has been making crystal jewelry since 1892, and their consistent quality has kept the company going through wars and the rise and fall of empires. These excellent earrings are made of sterling silver and Swarovski crystals, and are quite attractive. If you are looking for some nice, crystal and silver earrings, then these are the ones to get. 

By the way, they look great when combined with the Heart, Star and Starburst crystal tattoos - which I also highly recommend!

Let's face it, it's hard to find a watch that has it all: a nice band, a decent color scheme, an elegant but not overbearing look.  This has it.  I'm sure some will say that the animation is too much, but it's very subtle, and it can be stopped at the tough of a button.   The crystal is not too large, and  not too small, and the band is tough

Bought this to use at work since I had to send in the one I usually wear for repairs. Lumi is extremely bright when charged. The Monster has gained 1 minute in 2 days which is not bad for an inexpensive Seiko. Swapped the band with a NATO, fits a little bit better on my wrist. Overall a good purchase

This is a rugged no frills watch that uses old school technology to do the job so they won't be around for long.

These earrings are the beautiful deep blue of genuine sapphires and the 1.0 carat size is just the right size (anything larger might tend to look "fake".

I've purchased from this merchant many, MANY times and always find myself typing in *Sabrina Silver* whenever I need or want a new and inexpensive piece of jewelry...they're the best and I've never been disappointed.

Got this at Amazon for a great price. The design is by Edwatd Mirell whose collection of mens's jewelry is unrivaled (sp?). This bracelet sells at Michaels Jewelers at the Mall for $100.00 I'm getting some of his other designs here at Amazon. You won't regret it. It's an elegant but masculine bracelet. Happy Holiday's.

You know how usual it is to see people wearing the tiffany love charmbracelet? This looks exactly like one of those, with a twist. It look more like tiffany bracelet with follie follie charms and its a watch. At a price like that, it's a steal! However, the bracelet is a little too long for my wrist. What's more interesting is that the box of the watch works as a clock itself. How practical can that be. If you are looking for a chrambracelet, this it is

These earrings are very pretty. They are a nice size and they aren't heavy at all, very lightweight. I have had them for a week or so now and have gotten nothing but compliments on them. They are great and so is the price! The vendor sent them very promptly and there were no problems.
