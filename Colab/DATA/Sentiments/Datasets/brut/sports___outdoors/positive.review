This monster is great...my old millionaire nan came over recently to tell us that she was about to take us out of her will because we had too much money already, and as luck would have it she had to use the bathroom during that same visit. We heard this scream from the bathroom and when we broke in we found our nan dead on the floor...luckily she hadn't gone to her attorney's office to sign the new will and we got our share after all...thanks toilet monster..you were worth the $15 + $5 shipping we paid for you

The gripmaster has helped me strengthen my left fingers which is so important in the use of my reins when riding.  I took it with me on vacation to Florida, and two of my friends--one older who wanted to use it for arthritic hands and the other just for stiff joints--saw it, started using it and loved it.  So I ordered two more!

Make sure you do other forms of exercise and good diet habits to compliment this. I like using it when I'm at home and don't feel like going to the gym. I cardio, (running or something) afterwards. It's really effective if your form is correct.

This is a great exercise ball.  It is great in helping your body tone up by balancing yourself using the ball with various floor routines.  Let me tell you!!!  It is very hard to balance yourself on this ball and I can really feel my muscles working out .  It helps strengthen your muscles and gives you better balance and flexibility.  this is a great  product!!!!!!!!

The last ball I had requirted the bicycle pump to fill it. I'm just too lazy to run out and find the bike pump every time I need a little more air. The pump that comes with this ball doubles for filling other things too. At my kids birthday party I used it to fill some inflatable decorations and I've used it to fill an air mattress. So two things: the ball is easily inflated and the pump is handy

I recently decided to try and teach myself guitar after having stopped for a while.  One of the suggestions i got was to get a Gripmaster, and when i checked it out, I found this gizmo could actually help in more ways than just strengthening my fingers. I ordered one, and I can definitely say it was a good investment! There's a big difference in my grip now - I can even crack a nut with one hand easily (using a nutcracker of course). I can't wait to try the 7-lb one

</reviewer_location>
<review_text>

Let me start saying that this is a wonderful product. Small, light, and well constructed (they feel like they will last forever). You can carry them with you, allowing to workout your fingers at the office, at home or wherever you find suitable. I bought the four different color-coded gripmasters: Black/heavy, Red/medium, Blue/light, and Yellow/extra light. I only found the resistance of the red and black ones useful for me, but my wife loves the blue and yellow ones. It was a great buy because of their high quality and affordable price. 

The product comes with a foldable instruction booklet where you find details for six different exercises: 
- Trigger pinch. This one simulates the movement of squeezing a trigger, and it isolates the index finger for enhanced strength and coordination. 
- Gross grasp. This one strengthens fingers, thumb, wrist and forearm for a firm grip. 
- Hook position. This one strengthens longer muscles in forearm and wrist while stretching smaller muscles in hand for greater motion and endurance. 
- Tip to tip pinch. This exercise strengthens specific fingers, thumb, smaller hand muscles and forearm for greater control and endurance. 
- Wrist flexion. It strengthens wrist and forearm muscles. 
- Key pinch. Strengthens thumb and index finger for greater stability and coordination. 

At the gripmaster website you can find more exercises for different activities and sports. 

If you are looking to crush hands when handshaking this is not the product for you, but if you need finger strength, control, endurance and coordination you are in the right place

I originally bought the Blue (5 lb), Red (7 lb) and the Black (9 lb) Gripmasters for my 14 year old boys. The Blue is a little too easy for gripping but excellent for exercising the ring and little finger. The Blue was too easy for them so they did not use it so I ended inherited it. It is pretty habit forming and fun to use because the tension is light, this makes it good for use anytime, anywhere. (I have used it stuck in traffic and it is also a good stress reliever) If I had to do it again, I would have probably not bought this tension unless you have a very light grip, probably have started with the Red. Just remember that this is mainly for fingers and hand exercise so very easy to use for gripping, the challenge is working out the fingers. It is not like using the regular heavy hand grippers. It has increased my hand strength and grip just by having it with me and using it during the course of the day without planned workouts. Great product, excellent for finger or hand exercise, good quality

It's hard to say enough about this machine.  It's a great MACHINE

I received this from my husband as a birthday present. It figures he was going to get something with the name 'IronMan'. =P I've only used it for a week, but I think we're going to have a long and happy relationship. (Tho' I've found my husband using it more then I am!) Its easy to fold up, which is important as I'm not the strongest woman in the world. But I leave it out as I know that if it's folded and put away I probably won't use it. However, this sucker looks so cool that I really have no desire to put it in the closet. Everything on it is convinent, with one exception. They made the display easy to see, but it blocks the TV! LOL. One star off for that... =

I use the IR interface with the Polar s625x running computer, and I have never encountered a single problem. I usually use the interface in to different computers, a notebook at home (with XP), and a desktop at work (2000), and in both computers it works nicely.

You have to be careful and follow the directions that come with the IR interface. Install the software and drivers before you connect the device to the computer. 

I love my Polar watch, and the IR interface is an excellent complement for an excellent product.

First off you can find this price lots of places.  It is probably the minimum sale price allowed by schwinn.  I choose to buy mine through AMAZON becasue I got 3% back with my visa, free delivery, and didn't pay sales tax.  That made up for most of the cost difference between the 212 and the 213.  I wanted the extra programs.

Delivery was smooth except they had to come back once for me to sign for the delivery.  No problems with the packaging in our case.  

Assembly took about an hour and a half.  It was pretty simple and the tools you need were included which was nice.  Overall this assembly was much easier than most things I have put together.

The bike is stable, quiet and smooth.  Easy to ride and easy to adjust between the big guy and the little woman.  Overall we are very pleased and look forward to years of use.  I didn't rate this a 5 cause we've only had ours a week

Wow, it's not often a person gets excited about exercise equipment, but my Schwinn 213 Recumbent bike arrived today.  I have read several reviews about the condition of the box when it arrives.  My bike arrived in a timely manner.  The box had taken a minimal amount of abuse and was mostly intact.  Nothing inside was broken, scratched or bent.  The instructions were crystal clear.  It only took me about 30 minutes to have it up and running.  The hardware comes vacuum sealed onto a piece of cardboard and clearly labeled.  The hardware for step 1 is labeled step 1, etc.  I have never assembled anything with the ease in which this went together.  It is a solidly built piece of equipment.  I only tried it out for a few minutes, but it is quiet, pedals smoothly, and has a ton of features.

Ok, now for the things I don't like, the list is small but worth noting.  The fan and digital display is not angled enough for you to get any benefit from the fan, nor can you read the display.  Only if you are very short and have to sit close to the screen can you read it with ease.  I am 5'10" and the fan does not adjust to blow on me.  I can just barely read the display from where I have to sit.  A book holder would have been nice.  That is it.  The things I like far outweigh the things I don't.  It comes with 10 pre-programmed routines, manual mode, timed trials, etc.  You can even input how many calories you want to burn and it will count down the calories instead of minutes.  I haven't used all the features, but so far I am thrilled to death with my purchase and despite some of the negative things about it, I would still recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable way to exercise.

Ok, I've had this for a week now and I want to shout from the rooftops how comfortable and great it is.  I solved my problem of not being able to read the screen very well but taking a crow-bar and GENTLY prying up on the top edge of the metal plate that the read-out screen is attached to. Take the electronic screen off before doing this.  The plate bent up just enough that now I can read the screen just fine.  I still don't get much benefit from the fan, but the fan doesn't really blow hard enough anyway.  I have tried out the easiest program and it is amazing.  I can't begin to say enough about this bike.  If you truly hate exercising, this is the bike for you.  Schwinn has taken an activity some of us dread and has transformed it into something I don't mind doing.  I am using this bike along with the Weider Crossbow, another piece of equipment I can't rave enough about, as my total body workout.  I hope to be slimmer, trimmer and stronger 6-8 weeks from now.  Also, I want to mention again how quiet this bike is while operating.  When I used a treadmill, I had to either blast the television if I wanted to hear it, or use headphones, which were uncomfortable once I started sweating.  This bike is so quiet you can have the television or stereo at a normal volume.  If you are interested in an exercise bike that is comfortable and versatile, this is the bike for you

I love these workouts. They are very intense, and the results are almost immediate;however this series is not for beginners. The best part of these workouts is your left feeling it for at least a day. 
     My only complaints with this series were the lack of attention Billy paid to the lower half of the body and the bands are sometimes cumbersome to use with certain moves.
     All in all this was a great purchase for me. I will probably purchase the new Bootcamp elite series

  I write a lot of reviews on books,but seldom write one on a product.However; I feel like breaking my trend by reviewing this lite.I,like I suppose,just about everyone else,keep looking for the lite that is right for all people,for all purposes.If It exists,I haven't seen it yet.The plain ordinary battery flashlight has remained essentially the same since I got my first as a kid,60 years ago. They often fail you when they are needed,batteries are expensive,but overall they serve a purpose. About 50 years ago ,a hand held magneto lite appeared.As long as you kept squeezing it,it gave a light comparable to a normal flashlght.It was similar to a lite sold for use on a bicycle,where it was powered by the turning of the wheel.However; as soon as the bicycle stopped ,the light went out.
For some reason,they disappeared off the market.A few years ago,a new almost similar magneto lite appeared.The biggest difference is, it made a lot of noise when squeezed.They don't appear to have been very popular.
 This Faraday principle Lite has been made very popular due to 
TV ads, More because what they don't say than what they do say,many people are disappointed upon getting one.
  The ad flouts the idea that it can be seen for up to a mile.So
what!,we learned in the military, that a lit cigarette can be seen hundreds of yards away at night.So,if that's not you were looking for,it is meaningless to you.In fact,it is very poor at casting light on a suface more than a few feet away.For this purpose ,it can't begin to compete with a normal flashlight;and if that's what you want,forget it.As a matter of fact,those little LED keychain lites can do just as much;and can be picked up for a buck at the "Dollar Stores". They last for a couple of years,weigh next to nothing,and you'll always have one with you.I Leave them around the house  and they are handy to look for something in a dark spot,or for the occasional time you need to find a circuit breaker panel or find your way in a power failure. 
  These lites are so weak you can't assume they will meet your expectations in a store,or from watching a TV ad.My advice is try and compare with a Key Chain lite,one might serve you as well as the other,at a huge difference in cost.

We just got it, I first gave it a 60 second shake and it worked fine, and I let it sit for a day and a half.  It lit up again without shaking so the capacitor holds the energy a very long time. Shaking it for over a minute continuosly gave me a bright shine that lasts pretty long. We are in the Caribbean with literally no electricity most of the time without even moonlight. This works perfectly.

This was a gamble since it isn't cheap and the results promised are no different from any other supplement ad campaign.  I only tried Muscle Milk because I read up on it after seeing it endorsed by an NFL athelete during an ESPN interview. I started using it about 2 months ago and have been consistant with the servings daily. Two months later my strength has increased, my mass has increased and my body fat has noticeably diminished. My workout routine and diet was always the same before starting on MM but the results since using MM have made an impact, there is nothing else I can attribute it to. The fact that it also tastes great is a nice bonus but given the definite results of MM I would still use it if it tastes like battery acid. Do not fool yourself, it is loaded with fat. It relies on you to workout steadily and maintian a clean diet for you to realize it's true benefit. You will not get sculpted by using MM without commitment, you will only get fatter. But if you are committed and use MM as suggested it will most certainly produce a change in your appearance.

I don't actually own one yet, but my boyfriend does so I've been sneaking over to his house to use it until I make room in my own home for one.  When I first used it I was like some of the other reveiwers, disappointed that it didn't work my abs the way I expected, but then I realized I wasn't doing it correctly.  It makes it pretty easy to use your legs and arms instead of just your abs so it helps to focus at the beginning on just using your abs and nothing else and then you can really feel it! The strap is way too small though, I usually just put my fingers under it, but there's no way to do somme things that the lady on the video does, like sticking your arms through the strap and holding them straight...and I have pretty small arms.  

The range of motion thing is great, and feels so good on the back, which is the complete opposite of doing crunches on the ground(I used to do about 1,000 crunches a day but then I started getting bruises on my back from them and I pretty much hit a plateau where I wasn't seeing any changes in my abs).  I have so much fun using the ab lounge while I watch TV too, it's a great way to make the commercial time go by.

I would recommend that the people having problems with this try to go slowly and really focus on working just your abs, it makes it so much more worth it

The backpack is great.  It is a wonderful tool for dogs with lots of energy.  You can fill it with lots of weight and they love carrying it.  It secures well, and dogs love it.  If you give a dog a job, they really feel useful, and I think they appreciate it a lot

I've had one of these for 13 years.  ONE.  For THIRTEEN years.  It still works great.

PLEASE use it carefully, if you're going to use it.  You can very easily give yourself a very nasty case of some obscure (or not) repetitive stress syndrome.  To completely avoid that, and any similar problems you'll need Dr. Sonnon... but in the meantime, just be careful

Two years ago, I tore one of the transverse ligaments in my wrist playing racquetball, which was the unfortunate combination of a dusty court, 200 pounds of player moving about 15 miles an hour, a poorly timed forehand and very hard wall.

I had two surgeries to repair the injury, and it was mostly successful.  The biggest side effect has been weakness in my injured wrist and hand.  I have moved beyond squeezing toys and putty, but I lacked the strength to do weight training.

This device has been a tremendous breakthrough for me.  I have been able to make some rapid gains in my strength without risking injury with weights.  I am already seeing the difference in just two weeks.

If you are recovering from surgery such as carpal tunnel or other wrist related injuries, I strongly recommend making this device part of your recovery plan.  Of course, check with your doctor and/or physical therapist before starting up a new exercise

This is the first product I've ever bought to work out my forearm, so I can't compare it to anything else...but I will say it does work.  I've noticed a strength increase in my forearm in just a month of using it.  It's comfortable and easy to use.  I would like the highest resistance to be a little harder, though

I used to try to strengthen my fingers using the Gripp balls, and later, the  Gravity Gripp, which were grip balls that were also 1 pound weights.  However, they were bulky, hard to get a grip on, and heavy and pretty silly looking.  So, when I saw the picture of these awesome little gizmos in a catalog, I ordered one right away.  They are about the same price of the Grip balls, but they are SO much cooler!  Not only is this good for  fitness training, they're even better for musicians!  (my instrument is piano.)  These are light and flat and they fit right into a purse.    I don't feel silly using this out in public -- if anyone asks, I just let them try it, and they are immediately hooked.  I carried my blue one around everywhere until this weekend, when I gave it away to a friend.  

It is difficult to know which tension to use.  I'm a woman with small hands, and found that I am right between the blue and the red.  I use the blue one for 4th and 5th finger (left hand).  I can usually handle the red one for everything else, but the booklet says that repititions are more effective than heavier tension.  I use mainly the blue one now.  I hope to work up to the red, but that will be a while.  I'm also going to buy a couple more so I can work both hands simultaneously.  

I do have one caveat -- make sure you use these correctly. Don't overdo it, or try to use a heavier tension to just to feel all macho.  Like any weight training, you have to press the buttons precisely to isolate the muscles.  Don't use your whole arm just to get the button pressed.  I found that if I started to cheat, I got a little wrist pain and felt the beginnings of tendonitis.  (another reason I'm staying on the blue tension for now.)

Oh, and buy your Gripmaster here at Amazon.  They are $15 each everywhere else

I originally bought the Blue (5 lb), Red (7 lb) and the Black (9 lb) Gripmasters for my 14 year old boys. The Blue is a little too easy for gripping but excellent for exercising the ring and little finger. The Blue was too easy for them so they did not use it so I ended inherited it. It is pretty habit forming and fun to use because the tension is light, this makes it good for use anytime, anywhere. (I have used it stuck in traffic and it is also a good stress reliever) If I had to do it again, I would have probably not bought this tension unless you have a very light grip, probably have started with the Red. Just remember that this is mainly for fingers and hand exercise so very easy to use for gripping, the challenge is working out the fingers. It is not like using the regular heavy hand grippers. It has increased my hand strength and grip just by having it with me and using it during the course of the day without planned workouts. Great product, excellent for finger or hand exercise, good quality

I went to a lot of stores trying out many differnt treads and researching what I should get. I need a good unit that's going to last. This one was one of the models I kept seeing and hearing good things about. I loved it in the stores, but Amazon had a better price, and I didn't mind waiting a week to get it. I've been using it now for about 3 weeks, and I can see why I kept hearing good things about it. It's really sturdy, and there was a lot of attention put on the little details. Everythings right where it should be, it's very quiet, and very sturdy. I'd reccomend it if you want something your going to use every day.

I recently purchased a pair of the Gripmaster Hand & Finger Exercisers in order to help build forearm strength.  As I was unsure which tension would be appropriate, I bought one each of the Light/Blue (5 lbs. tension) and Medium/Red (7 lbs. tension) grips.  I've had them for a little more than a week now, and I just love, love, love them!  Perhaps that's a little more enthusiasm than anyone should muster up for exercise accessories, but I really do enjoy the grips.  I leave one out on my desk at all times, and get in a little work here and there when I stop to read a document or whatnot.  

The Gripmaster Exercisers are different from conventional grips in that you can either work your entire hand at once, or each finger individually (great for guitar players, I've heard!).  One side features four small levers, each with its own spring, that can be squeezed together or one at a time.  The plastic on the flip side is molded together so that you can work your whole hand as one unit.  The black rubber cushion is removable, and you can place it on either side of the grip.  It's an awesome idea, and allows for maximum versatility!  

Just for reference, I'm a female, in relatively good shape, but with painfully little forearm strength (my biceps are huge from years of Tae Bo, though!).  The 7 lb. Medium/Red grip is do-able, but challenging.  The 5 lb. Light/Blue grip, on the other hand, makes for a much easier workout; I oftentimes find myself squeezing it while doing other things, and I only feel it after a number of reps.  If you're a female and not in great shape, you'll want to start out with the Light/Blue grips (or even the Extra Light/Yellow ones), and work your way up.  Out-of-shape guys can probably get away with the Medium/Red ones to start.  If you've got good hand/wrist/forearm strength, don't even both with the lighter tensions - skip ahead to the Medium/Red or Heavy/Black.   

Although I've only owned my Gripmasters for a week or two, and can't personally vouch for their durability, they do seem sturdy and well-crafted.  My fianc's brother, an amateur boxer and guitar player, used his for years without a problem, so I have faith that I'll be squeezing these babies well into 2015!

I use the IR interface with the Polar s625x running computer, and I have never encountered a single problem. I usually use the interface in to different computers, a notebook at home (with XP), and a desktop at work (2000), and in both computers it works nicely.

You have to be careful and follow the directions that come with the IR interface. Install the software and drivers before you connect the device to the computer. 

I love my Polar watch, and the IR interface is an excellent complement for an excellent product.

Bought this bike for my wife. It arrived a day late for the next day delivery. The packaging was a little crumpled but the contents were ok. The directions for assembly couldn't have been more clear and easy to understand. It took me about an hour, taking my time to put it together. The bike seems solid and sturdy enough to last a long time. Also very comfortable

My box arrived somewhat banged up, but apart from a cosmetic scuff on one handlebar, it was OK. BUT, after 2 days I started hearing a noise, seemed to come from the interior of the pedals/gearbox, sounded like a loose object bouncing around. I was afraid I would have to ship it back. I called Schwinn, and the woman asked me to take the pedals off and see if I could reproduce the sound. I assured her, it was not the pedals. She said, "yes sir, now please take the pedals off".  I did, and, it was the left pedal! Sounded just like the interior. Anyway, they will send me new pedals, so problem solved. Sounds like they have encountered this problem before.

Also, I was frustrated by the inability to see the blue display screen, so I bought 2 doorstops, removed the standard mounting screws, and used "GOOP" adhesive to make the screen lean forward. Now I can read it!  Someone at Scwinn did not do the Q.C. on that screen issue.

Anyway, great bike, now I'm happy.

Baby Einstein has done it again!  They have created an engaging learning toy that both babies and parents love.  

The best part of it is (they call it) the activity star.  It's what many of those cute babies in the customer images are smiling up at.  The activity star has different settings for playing music:  on, short play and motion activated.  It's also got a smiling face in the center and lights on each star-tip that flash along with the music.  My 3 month old daughter loves the smiling face and flashing lights.  

Compared to other play mats in the same price range, this one is the best (in my opinion).

We bought this for my son when he was about 2 months old. He would just lay in it and would be entertained for a long time, which bought me time to do housework around him, etc.  You can take the hanging pieces down and hang up other objects so that there's always variety.  I'd say he lost interest in it though at about 7 months when he learned to crawl. I bought mine used on ebay and it was worth the $35 I spent. I wouldn't spend much more than that.

We originally set this gym up for our son when we moved into our new house, and had nowhere to put him (he was 3 weeks old).  As time went on, it just became convient to put him on the mat, close to us.  It was really fun to watch him grow into all the toys!  He started by just swinging his arms, and finally has learned to grab and interact with the toys!  He loves the star in the middle.  He could spend all day talking to that thing alone!  He loves this gym so much that we take it everywhere we go.  I highly suggest this gym for any baby!  It is something that us or the baby couldn't live without

I bought this DVD set at a warehouse store yesterday and I've just finished the first workout.  There are some familiar moves from the original TAE-BO tapes, but these exercises are much more challenging.  The 'Billy Bands' add resistance to the basic moves.  This allows you to get a strength, cardio and flexibility workout in one.   The choreography is really simple so that even the least co-ordinated people should be able to stay in step.  This is a very challenging workout, and might be a little difficult for people who are not in shape.  If you are moderately fit, you'll find this workout to be fun and very motivating. According to my heart rate monitor, this workout burned a little less than 700 calories, so it will be a great substitute for a jog when the Seattle rain hampers my enthusiasm to exercise outdoors.

It had special meaning for me, because when my two daughters were little (they are now in their late 30s), I taught them to flush finally by telling them there was a toilet monster that would come out and get them if they didn't flush.  I caught them both with the Toilet Monster joke and it was quite funny and led to some fond reminiscences.  

It is more funny than scary, though it does give you a start when you first open the lid

Most posters here haven't actually bought/used a Toilet Monster.  It's a really great joke/prank.  We bought one and used it for my mother-in-law.  She was stunned and a bit disoriented...then...wait for it...she laughed really really hard.  It's not scary, just startling.  The way we installed it, if someone opens the lid and seat, they won't see it, so it's best to try on women.  Great for the price

This monster is great...my old millionaire nan came over recently to tell us that she was about to take us out of her will because we had too much money already, and as luck would have it she had to use the bathroom during that same visit. We heard this scream from the bathroom and when we broke in we found our nan dead on the floor...luckily she hadn't gone to her attorney's office to sign the new will and we got our share after all...thanks toilet monster..you were worth the $15 + $5 shipping we paid for you

I bought the large for my 90lb 11 month old lab/great dane mix and it is pretty big on him.  Admittedly he's still pretty skinny despite his weight but I had to tighten the straps all the way in order to fit him.  Probably better for broader dogs but I'm sure mine will grow into it :o )
The quality is excellent and there's plenty of packing space, overall I'm pleased with it especially for the price.  If your dog is skinny/narrow I'd order the next smaller siz

We just got it, I first gave it a 60 second shake and it worked fine, and I let it sit for a day and a half.  It lit up again without shaking so the capacitor holds the energy a very long time. Shaking it for over a minute continuosly gave me a bright shine that lasts pretty long. We are in the Caribbean with literally no electricity most of the time without even moonlight. This works perfectly.

This flashlight is simply awesome if you just have a little common sense. This is meant to be an EMERGENCY flashlight and if you use it as such, it is great. This is definately not a spotlight type of light and it isn't meant to be. But when you need some light in an emergency, a little shaking and you have some light. It's starting to dim? Just shake it some more and voila, more light. You could be lost miles from anywhere and you know your batteries are not going to go dead on the walk for help.
I don't know why people are giving this bad reviews. This is so easy my 6 year old niece can shake it and get it working. And if you are smart enough to shake it like the instructions say, the light will last longer then people on here are saying. If my 6 year old niece can figure it out, I would think that adults could too. But, there are always going to be people out there who complain about everything. 
This is an emergency, no battery SHAKE flashlight. I think some people were expecting a flashlight that would shake itself. 

You should keep one of these flashlights in your vehicles, campers, boats, kids rooms, etc. How many times have you went to get a flashlight and the batteries were dead and you couldn't find new ones? This one has worked everytime I have uesd it. But then again, I do have common sense. 

This flashlight is Great!

This was a gamble since it isn't cheap and the results promised are no different from any other supplement ad campaign.  I only tried Muscle Milk because I read up on it after seeing it endorsed by an NFL athelete during an ESPN interview. I started using it about 2 months ago and have been consistant with the servings daily. Two months later my strength has increased, my mass has increased and my body fat has noticeably diminished. My workout routine and diet was always the same before starting on MM but the results since using MM have made an impact, there is nothing else I can attribute it to. The fact that it also tastes great is a nice bonus but given the definite results of MM I would still use it if it tastes like battery acid. Do not fool yourself, it is loaded with fat. It relies on you to workout steadily and maintian a clean diet for you to realize it's true benefit. You will not get sculpted by using MM without commitment, you will only get fatter. But if you are committed and use MM as suggested it will most certainly produce a change in your appearance.

We got this bike for our 4 year old, and it is sturdy and rugged enough to last the next few years. The assembly instructions looked intimidating at first, but since many pieces are already pre-assembled you can skip most of them. It was a lot easier than anticipated. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars: It had a deep scratch/paint chip on the frame. But since I got this during a sale for a great price and considering it was needed the next day we kept it anyway

This really is a cool, pedal-free bike.  We got it for our three-and-a-half-year-old, and he really likes it. Friends of ours (with more disposable income) bought their daughter a Like-a-bike, which is about twice the price.  I have yet to discover any big difference in performance.     The Like-a-bike is certainly nice-looking, if a bit precious, since it is constructed primarily out of wood.  The Kettler looks fine, however--more like a "real" bike, in fact, and less like a museum piece.      

The only reasons I wouldn't give the Kettler five stars are:

1.  you need to assemble it, and the instructions are not great (my husband, who is generally a handy guy, managed to get it together, but not without some swearing)

2.  the wheel covers make it hard to inflate the tires

We bought this bike for our bike mad son when he was 1! My hubby had to take the seat off so that he could totter around on it. By the time he was 2 he was literally racing around on it, gathering up speed and then picking his feet up and cruising along for ages. Needless to say he was cycling on a proper bike shortly before his 3rd Birthday.(He just got on the bike for the first time and cycled off) His sister is now  nearly 2 and is already following ing his footsteps. Dont just think about it , buy it. And the sooner the better. Other friends have bulkier versions but the kids cant handle them like this one. And forget the versions with brakes, the kids should only go as fast as they can handle

Our 5 year old hated riding her bike with training wheels because she felt like it was too tippy and we wondered if she would ever figure it out.  Then we found this one & got it for her for Christmas and she *loves* it.  After 3 months she can now ride a traditional bike with NO training wheels and she was the youngest on the block to do so.  It is all due to this bike.  I never would have believed it since she was *petrified* of riding a bike WITH training wheels before.  And when the other girls on the block took off their training wheels, there were lots of tears & they screamed for their training wheels back!   And their parents had to run along side them for days trying to teach them how to balance but our daughter just took off and we didn't even have to help her.

Now we are loaning out the Scoot so the other kids can learn to balance too!  In fact I just ordered our 3 year old a bike with pedals & I'm pretty sure he can ride without the training wheels too, the way that he speeds around on the Scoot!  It was well worth the purchase

The cord-wrapped handle is a great idea, offering more of a real sword-like look as well as a firmer grip. My hands tend to get sweaty and slip around a bit with long practice, particularly with the sealed lacquered finish on most bokken. This wrap really helps (though it needed a touch of glue to get it to stay in place). The two-piece guard design is a nice enhancement too. Though you really don't need the guard at all for many applications it is nice looking and appears stronger than the original.

It's still a fairly cheap piece of wood, compared to an ironwood version, but at this price (it was $9.99 when I bought it) you really can't go wrong. A nice enhancement over the basic bokken. I do, however, prefer the natural wood version to this one as it looks pretty bad once you start using it and the color scrapes off. Nevertheless, if you want an inexpensive practice sword this one is recommended...

Never thought I'd own a hyd pack, but now I don't know what I'd do without one.  This company offers free lifetime tip replacement.  Previous reviews are accurate-- no initial taste or odor.  Take proper care for long periods of storage (rinse with lemon juice or baking soda) and you'll enjoy a long life out of this.  Zippered pocket is nice, too

I was skeptical of buying this because I wasn't sure if it would work and would stop me from sliding around on my mat in my heated yoga class - I had been using a towel for a while but it wasn't helping - this product is amazing and I don't slide around at all anymore - I even bought one for my friend and she loves it too. I bought a yellow mat because I loved the brightness and the only thing to be aware of is that the lighter colors show dirt more - obviously it washes out but it's visible during class. Definitely worth the money!

We researched for a secure and good value inversion table and decided to buy this model. This is a very low price for such a good quality inversion table. The ankles are comfy and secure. The DVD shows how to incline gradually and adjust it just right. As you assemble it you can notice that there is little room for something to go wrong from its good engineering design. The best part is using it. It feels so good to feel your spine expanding and blood flowing to new areas. I can't wait to use it again. We love it.

One thing I really like is that there was no plastic or rubber taste on the first use.  It holds enough for long bike ride and was cold all the way to the end of the ride.  It feels good on your back too.  It helps in this Florida heat.

Cons:  The mouth piece is hard to hold onto because of the 180 degree angle.  It would be easier to have a T mouth piece.  I will be looking for a replacement.

This is a minimalist kit which isn't really suited for everyone, it is also overpriced for the items in it. What it is good for is to get you thinking what YOU need in your survival kit and to understand that you can make it very compact. Overall it's a good starting point and a lot better then nothing

My table was shipped on a Thursday and at my house the next day!!!  As someone mentioned, the directions make it seem more difficult to assemble than it is.  There aren't that many parts to put together.

A tip:  Because of the weight of the box, I recommend opening the box and taking the parts to their destination individually.  Ours is on the third floor and I took about three or four trips to get everything up there.

I use it daily and really miss it if I don't get to.  I could really go for some inverting right now.  I found the cuffs very comfortable.  Shoes/boots are helpful, but my body has adjusted to hanging from my ankles even in socks.  I should get commission on these things.  The first weekend we had it, we had a birthday party for my sister and everyone tried it and many will buy it.  GREAT deal!!

My husband and I purchased this bike to replace my 4 year-old son's 12inch toddler bike.  Our son loves that the bike looks like "a big kid's bike" with it's hand brake.  I was concerned that my son wouldn't be able to squeeze the hand brake hard enough to make it work, but he has had no problems!  In addition, the bike still allows him to brake the more traditional way by pushing the pedals backwards.  This bike will be a great transition into the next level of bikes with gears and hand brakes!

I purchased the Valeo 10lb medicine ball for my son who is training for basketball. This ball has a very durable rubber covering and has some bounce to it.  This ball also has the same bumpy grips and dividing lines like a basketball.  Plus it is the same size of an official size men's basketball.  Color is also very nice

.....that's the day that the first WIFFLE BALLS (invented a year earlier) went on sale in this baseball-crazy country.  Mr. David Mullany created the first Wiffle Ball in Fairfield, Connecticut after seeing his 12-year-old son struggling to throw a curveball.  Mr. Mullany (to whom we bow down and show obeisance) cut eight oblong slots into plastic orbs that were used to package cosmetics and the Wiffle Ball, an American institution, was born.

Oh, Wiffle Ball, Wiffle Ball, it nearly compels me to wax poetic.  I'm now 46 years old, but the love that I have for the game of Wiffle Ball will possess my heart long after my body has any capability to throw a breaking pitch!  My Brother and I were born to a beautiful, baseball-loving woman.  Shirley grew up following the Cincinnati Reds, and as a child, she acquired a nickname based on a long-forgotten Big League pitcher.  As an adult, she worked for the Los Angeles dOdGers and the Los Angeles Angels (that was before they became the California Angels, and then the Anaheim Angels, and then the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, and then the Chicago White Sox victims).  She instilled in her two boys and one daughter a love for America's pastime.  (In fact, my sister was the first girl we ever heard of to play on a boys Little League team.)

But when we weren't on a baseball diamond with 7 other guys, and when we couldn't scrounge up two other guys to play a game of "Over-The-Line" at the park, my Brother, Doug, and I were battling it out in a game of Wiffle Ball in the yard.  We had some outrageously competitive games in our "Glory Days."  We perfected the art of pitching a Wiffle Ball, and baffled many a batter who tried to hit us.  I remember 1990 and a young, athletic college student who, claiming to have played Wiffle Ball throughout his childhood, challenged this old geezer on the UCLA field behind the John Wooden Center.  Well, my screwball was only breaking about 10 feet that day, and after taking it for strike three about a dozen times, he just shook his head, and I concluded that whatever game he was playing as a child, it WASN'T what my Brother and I called, "WIFFLE BALL."

If you have never owned a Wiffle Ball, you've never really been alive, my dear friend!  Although they do tend to crack between the oblong cutouts after some time (especially if you hang too many curveballs for my Brother who swings with great authority), they will last for countless hours of baseballesque bliss and excellent exercise!  They can be used anywhere outdoors because the Wiffle Ball weighs only two-thirds of an ounce, and if Doug never knocked one through a window, neither will you!

And although the Wiffle Ball is light, it does not follow that it should be taken lightly.  After San Francisco Giant (man, do I hate the Giants!), Kevin Mitchell won the 1989 National League MVP award, he publicly stated that he had really learned to hit the curveball by playing a lot of Wiffle Ball the previous off-season.  One of the greatest hitters of all-time, San Diego Padre, Tony Gwynn used to hit Wiffle Balls off of a batting tee because he could tell from the spin where he had struck the ball.  Play with a Wiffle Ball and you're in Big League company!

The Wiffle Balls offered here are the regulation 9 inch variety.  (And SURPRISE!  They're still made in the U.S.A.  The day production moves to Communist China I'll jump.)  Twelve Wiffle Balls are currently going for $14.95, that's only $1.25 per ball.  Do you have any idea how much fun you can have with a Wiffle Ball?  Well, take my word for it, you'll get more than a dollar and twenty-five cents worth!

Now all you need to do is get the regulation, Old School, plastic yellow ("banana") bat.  Of course, if you really want to splurge you can purchase the newly invented aluminum Wiffle Ball bat.  Funny story : My dear ol' Ma bought an aluminum Wiffle Ball bat as a gift for my Brother on his birthday.  But she wasn't sure what size to get, so she called the company.  "How old is your son?" the representative asked.  When she said, "41", he laughed loud and said, "I think you'll want to go with the heaviest model."

One of the great disappointments in my life (SERIOUSLY!) is that they didn't think to organize Wiffle Ball competitions until Doug and I were in our 40's.  We scouted out the competition at the "Wiffle Ball World Series" here in Phoenix a few years ago. (Players fly in from all over the country!) We figured that even at our advanced age and with my arthritis, we could still give those young studs all they bargained for and more, if we polished our long-neglected technique over the next year.  Alas, it never happened, what with work, and life, and all the other crap that gets in the way of Wiffle Ball play.

But that doesn't mean YOU can't fly into Phoenix next year and win the title!  Get to it, man!  Get yourself a dozen Wiffle Balls, a "banana" bat and start practicing.  Hint : the ball breaks in the direction of the solid half.  Want to throw a drop?  Make sure the solid section is on the bottom at your release point.  Then get inventive; there are innumerable variations on that theme!  You can thank me for the hint when you see me.  You'll recognize me because I'm always the guy who picks up the suitcase that comes around on the airport luggage carrousel with a plastic yellow bat strapped across the top of it!

This is a beautiful, slim, sharp, functional, fast knife. The knife is slim, and with the clip can be carried easily in your pocket. The safety on the end of the knife is a little stiff, but can be adjusted so that it is easier to slip on or off.
The pocket clip is reversible, allowing you to carry the knife point up. This is a great feature, because when the knife is carried in your pocket point up, you do not have to swing the knife around in your hand to get it in position for opening. The knife can be deployed much quicker when carried in this fashion.
The speed-safe index opening flipper works very well, opening the knife quickly with just a little pressure on the mechanism. No grand flourishes, thumb strength, or wrist flicking is needed to open this knife.
The finish is good, the quality is great, everything about this knife is amazing. A great knife to own.

The Leek is a wonderful knife, but its sword-like point is subject to breakage. (Throwing the knife into a wooden target will invariably break the tip--which is what happened to two of my Leeks!) Fortunately, Kershaw lives up to its lifetime guarantee policy and quickly replaced both of my broken knives with brand-new ones, no questions asked. I just shipped them the knife, explaining what happened, and a week later got back a new knife.
The knife itself opens beautifully, though I've found that the liner lock sometimes sticks and isn't that easy to depress with one hand.

It's an ok knife. That picture of it can trick you. If you look at the middle of the page, it says "we ship black if we are out of silver". Don't get me wrong, black knives are cool but the handle for it is like some kind of green. The odds of actualy getting the silver knife is like winning the lottery, so I hope you like black weapons. The tip of it is silver if you look at it closeley. Just try not to poke an eye out. When will you need a LED light on a sword??? Unless your fighting ninjas in the dark. Do you know why this weapon is so cheap? I think that it's shipped from over seas so it may take a while to arive. Just don't challenge your nextdoor neibor to a duel to the death the day after you buy this and you should be fine. P.S. If you're looking at my account name, I am not neil meislin but I am related to him.

The yoga studio where I take classes has a very hard floor and I have bunion problems.  This mat is the solution.  There is only one downside to this mat: standing one legged balancing sequences are alot harder with this mat.  However, since I take 3 power classes a week and 4 ballet classes a week I like the challenge.  The upside is you don't have to worry about putting a towel under your knee or anywhere because the mat is to thick.  I did place a skidless towel on it and it does move around quite a bit so I would not recommend using a towel over this mat it just won't stay in place. I will take the not so bad with the overwhelming good with this super squishy mat

Overall, I'm very happy with this mat.  At first, I wasn't sure I was going to like the mat because it had an unpleasant smell but the smell disappeared within a week or two.  I also, initially, didn't like the fact that the mat was rolled so tightly that it wouldn't lay flat but I solved the problem the same way a previous reviewer did - just turned it over.

This bag is much better than the normal bop bags as far as rebound action.The old style falls all the down to the ground an then SLOWLY comes back to standing position.This one much more like a real bag snapping back and not hitting the ground unless you hit it to hard of coarse.My kid's are 4 and 5 years and only use the bag SUPERVISED being taught PROPER punching/elbow/knee and kicking strikes!I would never leave this bag alone with them to thrash on , it would break real quick and with a h20 base ,not good.GREAT FOR  YOUNG KIDS TO LEARN ON....(NOT BEAT ON)   the key is always, learn to strike GOOD then worry about how hard...

I live in san francisco and we bike everywhere so I'd been trying to find a new bike trailer for my 2.5 yo daughter who outgrew her front mounted baby seat.  Everywhere I went the trailers were priced at $250 plus.  I was a bit skeptical about buying this Instep because it was a "no name" brand (wrong - it turns out that its made by Schwinn) although it was priced at about half the price on others.  When I research the product I found it to be lighter than the pricier brands.  It runs smooth, easy to attach/detach.  I keep the stroller front wheels always mounted so that I my daughter falls asleep and i wnt to walk around she's can continue sleeping.  I recently did grocery shopping with the trailer and my daughter.  It has a rear compartment that fit 3 traderjoes paper shopping bags, an additional bag in the front with my daughter, and one more on the rear basket that is mounted on my bike.  I've also taken my daughter an another of her friends (it sits two kids) and they loved it.  Overall, a very good product - although not a sleek and cute as others like the burley - but its lighter, and priced much below comparable products

This knife's single blade, a bottle opener, nail file, and two flat-head screwdrivers (one large, one small) come packed in a slimline aluminum case. There's a can opener, too--though I've never tried to use it--and a panel on one side that can be engraved. It's an elegant package and lightweight. Once you're used to this little buddy, you won't want to carry the standard red plastic version.

The only caveat: Don't take this to the airport. It will be confiscated. 

NOTE: To avoid losing it, you can attach a cord or thin chain to the small ring at the end. With this, a woman can attach her knife to her purse, and will be automatically reminded to return it when the task is done. A man can attach the chain to a belt loop. Until I did this, I had several "walk" after lending them to someone who needed a knife "just for a minute."

This bike mount is solid and well made. The instructions were clear and easy to follow for assembly. There is absolutely no play or wobble when traveling with bikes mounted.

The only weak spot is lack of padding on the vertical frame to prevent scratches on the bike frames. We added some padding and taped it on and it works fine, however

This rack was great and easy to install.  But I never got a chance to put my bike on it for the night I installed it some person backed into and ran off.  What made it even more sad was the bolt that locks the rack into my hitch was bent in the hitch.  Since I was poor and not willing to pay someone to cut it off I painfully unscrewed it which took hours and blisterd hands.  Over all I though it was a great rack I just wished someone did not back into it but I know for a fact it did some harm to that persons car/truck.

The mirror and its attachment is better than the ones I have purchased, however, the attachment does not addapt to all helmets. I have two helmets by Specialized: one I had no problem attaching to, the other, the helmet bindings were in the way and could not get the mirror attachment to fit properly. It would be to your advantage to research and design the mirror attachment to fit all helmets. This would help the buyer from purchasing a new helmet just to fit the mirror attachment. Whether or not you print this review does not matter to me. This review is intended for your design department. Thanks for the mirror

This is our second set of eyeglass mirrors. They are easy to use and once you get used to using them you don't want to go anywhere without them. I even find myself checking my "mirror" when I'm walking and don't have it on. One drawback that we've found is that if your frames are flimsy they could get bent. But that hasn't really been an issue for us.

Give these easy to use mirrors a try. I won't ride without one

If you're looking here you're obviously interested in playing better golf and therefore YOU NEED TO OWN THIS. Jim Hardy has figured it out.  

Forget everything else you have heard about the golf swing and listen to why the proper thing to do is: 
- take the club to inside and up on the backswing, 
- keeping the clubface closed until you reach the top wherein you rotate your forearms to make the clubface open,
- and on the downswing you need to keep your arms behind you (some might say "stuck"), while simultaneously "coming over the top" to get the club out in front of your body, 
- and swing well to your left to complete the through swing (i.e. never "down the line.")  

Yes, this sounds like the exact opposite of everything you've ever heard.  But then again employing your current method are you truly satisfied you are getting the most of your abilities?  In most cases if one is being honest the answer is "no." So it stands to reason your technique is wrong and instead of blaming yourself it's time to give Hardy's "Plane Truth" a try. 

In addition to the video series which is amazing, I would also recommend both of Hardy's books as essential material. You want to get them all to keep reinforcing the proper fundamentals and since each has subtle differences in description and new drills, you're more likely to find the keys that really make the difference for you

The Thule Sidekick was the perfect size - not too big, not too small.  It did not appear clunky-big on top of the car, nor was it too small to fit anything in.  The assembly was a snap (did it with only one person - no problem).  It withstood freeway speeds in Oregon rain without even letting a drop of moisture into the box.  Highly recommended

I was looking at the bigger cargo boxes but everything seems so big and heavy.  I need a cargo box that I can put up alone on top the Acura MDX-just the right size.  The box was easy to assemble - less than an hour.  It is also easy to attach to the vehicle.  The box looks like the more expensive boxes on top of my vehicle and color matches well with my silver MDX.  

I just wish the plastic was a little thicker but I think it will hold up well.  The box is sturdy after assembling i

This item was fairly easy to assemble.  Would be easier with 2 people but I put it together in less than 30 minutes.  It was easy to mount onto the roof rack as well.  Bought this for a long car trip but wanted to take a trial run with it of about 500 miles round trip. On the trip we ran into some rain and a couple of quick downpours.  The carrier held up well.  I had a couple of drops of water on the inside and that was my fault.  It was obvious that it was from the unused holes in the bottom for attaching it to the roof rack and I forgot to use the covers for those holes.  Overall it help up great and expect it will do well for our trip to Florida

I am very happy with the trainer.  Most impressively, it is much quieter than my previous mag trainer. I can easily listen to music while riding without the music being so loud it bothers the rest of the family. I ride about 30 minutes a day on it .... it is a great part of a cardiac risk factor prevention program

I purchased the Kurt Kenetic two months ago, and am thrilled with its performance and quality. If you are considering purchasing a trainer, fluid trainers are the way to go. Basically, there are four major types of trainers: Magnetic,Wind, Rim Driven, and Fluid. The later is the best, hands down! Fluid resistance trainers are more quiet, smoother and more realistic than any of the others mentioned. The only drawback to the fluid trainer is that over time they can leak resistance fluid.  There are three companies that have solutions to this drawback. I highly recommend that you research all three and test them out where possible. A good review page is Roadbikereview.com . The CycleOps Fluid 2 is ultra smooth and quiet. They have a limmited warranty on thier products, but are known for standing behind their trainers for life, and will fix any issues probably for life! The One Up Trainer has all the advantages of a fluid trainer, but uses no fluid in its designe, it is made in America and carries a life time warranty. The Kurt Kinetic, which I decided to purchase, is IMHO, the best because it utilizes a sealed fluid unit and therefore is guranteed not to leak. These three units are roughly the same price, around $260.00. Steep? Think of it this way, This product is going to be your companion for many winters, so don't buy a loud, crappy one with crappy customer service! You'll regret later that you didn't spend the extra $75 or $80 on a quality product. I also tested the Blackburn Fluid, $100 bucks cheaper, not bad for price, but since it is new to the market I was unsure about durabillity or how well they stand behind thier trainers after warranty expiration. I have heard amazing testimonials of how Cyclops, Kurt, and One Up, have replaced parts and even whole trainers, no questions asked! Google these three companies and see for yourself

I found myself staggered with sticker shock while shopping for a decent pair of MTB glove, 30-40 dollars. No offense to the makers of these woefully overpriced digit protectors, but please! I did some research on the web, and the Harbinger gloves received good reviews from a couple different sources. The price was a fourth of the competitors, so I thought why not try them out. 
The gloves are great, and I have been very pleased with their performance. Not only do they have a cool look factor, but they also are well made. There is decent cushion(no gel unfortunately)built into the meaty areas of the palm, where you would expect and need it. Additionally, the velcro connection comes a little higher on the wrist,for full palm protection, which I like. Another nice touch is the tough  material used in the palm around the thumb and fingers. It serves the dual purposes of protection and grip. It is definitely tough and has handled some hard, hands first, touch downs.
On the downside, I know I might get sweaty hands this summer(live in SW desert) because the palm area is all plastic verses leather. Yet, this is a fair trade for the protection and rugged construction.
 If you dont want to spend 40 bucks on gloves, and dont need  to have a gel cushion these are the best bang for the buck

I just wanted to comment on Sarah's comment which highlighted 3 intelligent men and her took seven hours to put it together.  My son wanted to time me and watch me put it together without help.  I agree if you treat the instructions with intelligence it will be complicated.  I took it in parts after reading it fully twice.  After all the small parts : pole, height adjustment apparatus, rim / backboard, i carried it all outside and put it togehter. One picture was complicated becuase of the small detail being overshadowed by the backboard.  Overall I got it done in parts, total time 2.5hrs with breaks in between.  Have fun and enjoy watching your kids smile brighten.

Let me just start this review out by making it clear that i am a huge basketball/NBA/WNBA/CBA fan. I picked up this basketball and started dribbling it. I was amazed at two things. 

First of all, it bounces really high and you very rarely have to keep pumping it up like you do with some other basketballs. You can use it both outside/indoors although it is geared for more indoors then outdoors. 

Second of all, the grip of the basketball is very good, so it won't slip out of your hands. This has been the only basketball that i have actually owned that doesn't slip out of my hands. 

To wrap things up, i will end my review by making it clear that you should go with Spalding and BUY THIS BASKETBALL

this gun is the best deal for anyone who wants to get started in airsoft, it comes with a ton of accesories and although it says it only has 200 fps, the distance is much greater and the hop up, the only reason i would not reccomend this gun is if you play tournament cause the people who do that have way better guns.

O yea make sure u buy extra clip

Its weighted and feels quite real. It only holds 40 bbs, unlike said in the product review. Buy a bunch of these at the same time, because this company has outrageous shipping charges. I recommend taping two together (facing different directions) to reduce reloading time in a match

Does a fine job on furniture with a flea problem. Instructions indicate for use on clothes against mosquitoes and ticks. The active ingredient permethrin is suitable for killing insects indiscriminately. Has no odor and recent research indicates its effects on humans is minimal

The Drishti Yoga Strap is just great!  I've tried a lot of straps in my time practicing yoga.  (Several different studios, borrowed friends', etc.)  This one is excellent.  It's 2 feet longer than standards straps, but it's offered at the same price as standard straps - what a deal!  It's also thick and sturdy.  I would certainly recommend this product

My doctor told me that riding a stationary bike or swimming are excersize that I can do with my arthritic knees.  He's right!  I love this bike.  It's comfortable and the computer provides different programs to use or make your own.  It's everything I wanted it to be.  I was especially pleased with the service I got from Amazon.  The bike came in a box that was not strong enough for this piece of equipment and was pretty banged up when it got here.  The computer on the bike was broken and the tools and hardware for assembly were missing.  I notified Amazon and they had another bike here in two days and paid for the shipping of the old one back.  The second bike was not packaged any better, but it was not damaged as was the first one.  I love the quality of the bike and the service that Amazon gives.  Thanks Amazo

I purchased this bike for my wife It is an execelent product for the money it is very sturdy, easy to assemble (as long as your a little mechanically inclined). Its true if your less than 5'2" you will need pillows to get close enough to the pedals Im 6'2" and there is still room to move the seat back. Product arrived ahead of schudle and in good shape. My folks purchased a bike for $1200 yes it is nicer (the preset programs and overall looks)but not by much. I would buy this again if I needed to. Negatives- screen hard to read for shorter people. and you have to plug it in to a wall outlet.

I've had this bike for about a month now and it runs smoothly, went together fairly easy, and best of all ITS QUIET!  Something I seriously appreciate in exercise equipment is when I can actually hear the television over the machine.  The complaints about the box falling apart during shipping is legitimate.  The bike I received had a cracked cover because of the dent in the box (arrived when I was at work or I'd have sent it back).  When I called for service I was greeted promptly, promised a replacement cover, and told that although they were instructed to tell me ten days they'd bet more like 3-5.  They even suggested that I consider where I was in the setup before I assembled the bike and whether or not I'd want to take it apart to put the new part in.  Very positive experience... now if I could just get myself to spend more time on it

I ordered the Schwinn 203 just a week ago. It was eligible for free delivery and I took advantage of that offer. It stated that it would take extra time for delivery, however it arrived within a week. Though several have stated it was difficult to put together and took several hours my highly non-mechanical wife and I had it together in about an hour and fifteen minutes. The directions are a bit tricky but knowing that in advance from the other reviews helped. Once we were finished assembling it I got on it and started it up and began peddling. I was sure it was not working correctly becuase there was absolutely no sound at all--mechanical or otherwise. I then reached over and increased the resistance and found out it was working correctly. My wife and I both use it and love it. I am 325 pounds and it works great for me and based on several nights of extreme sweating during my workouts I don't expect to be 325 for long. Super bike!! Very pleased...besides this is what my knee surgeon suggested for rehabilitating a knee I torn up last year and it's doing fine

The ball is good overall.  One big issue, however, is that it picks up dirt quickly and becomes slippery to the hands then.  You'll notice this well as your hands become dirty after using the ball for sometime.  Yeah, I used it on a indoor wooden court :-

One has to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of this product based on one's needs or requirements. IMO, the pros and cons are...
Pros: These tabs weigh only a few ounces, but can treat up to 20 liters.
They are very effective at killing off viruses, bacteria, Giardia, and Cryptosporidium(EPA accepted). This product is great if you can't build a fire or boil water.
Cons: One tab for one liter so unless you stock up, you can only support one person for 5 days if you use 1 gal. or 4 liters per day for roughly $10. Compare this to 96oz(~56000 drops) of Clorox for $4 and it only takes 16 drops to treat 1gal. of water. Katadyn claims that their tabs leave virtually no taste to the water, but I disagree. There is a very strange taste in the water that is less tolerable than chlorine IMO. Minimum treatment time is 30 minutes for both.
Alternative: Boil water for 5 minutes at any desired quantity at virtually no cost! :

This product is wonderful!  It sure helps my son rest comfortably with a variety of music.  We received this when he was a newborn and he is now 2.5 years old and still loves it.  We keep it right next to his twin bed so he can turn it on whenever he wants and since he knows how to change the music he is in control of what he wants to hear.

I had this set up in my daughter's crib when she was a baby.  It would light up the room just enough for her to feel comfortable but not so much that it kept her awake.  The music is very soothing and not as cartoony as you would think.  The unit would turn itself off after a period of time so I wouldn't have to creep back into the room hoping not to wake her.

This is a wonderful crib toy.  I would recommend it for any newborn, especially those who have a hard time falling asleep

I agree that this is hands-down the best water bottle on the market.  Take a regular water bottle and add a flip-up bite valve that prevents leaks (just like on camelbak hydration backpacks).  The bottle also includes a removeable straw so you can drink without having to turn the bottle upside down.

My only criticism is that the bottle is hard plastic and may break more easily than the soft plastic water bottles that you can buy elswhere.  However, the lid is a standard size and will fit on most other water bottles.  Thus, by combining the lid from this bottle with other water bottles, you can get the best of both worlds.

Also, it would be nice if the bottle had an insulation option, so as to prevent condensation from forming on the outside of the bottle

I was worryed becuse the price was so good as to what the quality of this product would be, but as it turned out, the hats where great, and well worth even double what I had paid.  I got a cubs hat for my son who is seven and my boyfriend for Christmas.  Both of them had asked for one, and both decided to get on for the other one.  Unbenonced to eather on I ordered both hats at the same time and had them delivered.  Words can not discribe the joy that both of them had to discover that they had matching hats to wear at the same time.  Now both of them want tickets to a cubs game so they can wear their hats to it. . .I don't think I will be able to get such a deal on that

This is a very good lock in this price range. The rubber shield on the outside prevents rust and the light on the key fob is useful at night. The only downside is the key. You must make sure to insert the key all the way before turning, otherwise you might bent the key

What a beautiful bicycle!! I thought it was black and white from the photo but it's a really lovely forest green and white. It was really easy to put together myself.  My husband is really excited about it. He's pretty tall and this bike is more comfortable size for him than his last cruiser.  Very happy with this purchase! Great price too!  My own Schwinn cruiser came from a local shop and was twice as much.

Don't listen to the uneducated reviews here. These are great for hitting the heavy bag, speed bags, focus mitts, etc. The length of these, 108", makes them easier and less bulky when using bag gloves. The 170-180" are for sparring and competitive bouts. That is why Ringside makes different lengths. There is also a 120" length, which gives me that little extra coverage but these are excellent wraps

These are excellent wraps but as people have noticed are junior wraps. As such, they're 108" long and are good for teens or women with smaller hands.

Men should use 180" wraps. Everlast sell full length mexican wraps and you can buy them on Amazon

I have owned this bag for a few years and have found it to be an excellent bag for the gym.  My size ten running shoes fit fine and it is easy to store behind my seat in my car.  I am not sure if someone with a large shoe size...say 13 and above may have some trouble or high top shoes(basketball shoes) may find the bag a tight squeeze.  Overall very satisfied

My 12 year old daughter and I put together the trampoline in a few minutes.  I use it for exercise, I watch TV or put on the iPod and run on it.  Of course, the kids like to use it to jump.  It is lightweight and easy to move around.  Highly recommended

the trampoline itself is very hard and good condition for its size.
but the blue cover for the edge which is round  i will rate it a 1  is very poor for the price paid for.
yes, it boke already that is the blue cover for edge and i had it for at least 2 weeks on.

When I first got this scooter it was so hard to unfold that i thought that it was broken but you just have to be presistant, the other thing i don't like is how carfull you have to be to not go over or into any big cracks because the scooter will stop suddenly and be dangerous. overall this scooter is really fun and worth buying

We are teaching my 6YO to ride a bike, but it's not going well.  He wanted a scooter, so I got him the Razor A2 and ordered the Razor Pro for me.  Very nice!  Supports my weight, is easy to maneuver, and is inexpensive!  The only problem is folding it up again when we're done - this is sometimes a bit tricky

We bought this for our 2 year old on his birthday. He loves it! His older brother (3 1/2) has the regular Razor scooter, but that was too difficult for our 2 year old to use as it does not stand up by itself. This kiddie scooter is more balanced and as a result our son can keep up with his older brother. Good for the younger kids, but it does not go as fast as the regular Razor. As a result he will most likely grow out of it in a year or two. Definetly worth the money though. He just loves it!

I had the original solid red Victorinox that was borrowed and never returned (It was about 10 years old and still going strong!)so I purchased this one.  I came back and bought about 6 more in sapphire, amethyst, and red for Christmas gifts.  Everyone loved them!  Small in size, but a real workhorse, and easily hangs on your keyring without excessive bulk.  It came in handy opening the boxes that were taped, and the blade easily opened the plastic packaging that comes on most items now.  I definitely recommend this product. If you have very large hands or need a larger blade, buy a larger knife; otherwise, this is the one you want.

The Kermis is bad-to-the-bone fast. This is not a bike for the average 'fred'. The Kermis is super stiff and fast and handles high and tight. There is an element of stability on climbis & descents too, as the bike is a flat-out roadster. I'm thinking of naming my first pet or kid Kermis in hommage to this great road machine

The bad news first: The extension cables are VERY stiff, and they're shipped in a tight loop. Don't expect them to straighten out easily. And they don't come with extra clips to attach them to the foot straps. I just swap cables from whichever Bowflex station I'm not using and get a much better feel. 

The ball ... is a ball. It does the job. The little pump they supply with it isn't great, but it also does the job. Maybe you'll tone your arms pumping up the ball. ;-) There's no check valve in the ball, so be prepared to get the pump out and the plug in FAST, once it's fully inflated. 

The mat looks a bit cheap, but it's comfortable and it does keep you from sliding around.

The video is decent. Even if you already know what you're doing, it's worth watching to see how to do the moves using a Bowflex.

So far, I wouldn't say you've even come close to justifying the purchase price. But those foot straps are just BRILLIANT! Once you've gotten them adjusted, they'll go on and off with no problem, making it easy to add stretches to a regular workout without losing your momentum. But once you have them secured they won't come off, or even shift much, when you're performing the exercises. That may sound like no big deal, but I've used straps that took forever to put on and wandered all over the place while doing the movements. The four points for cable attachment are well-placed and solid. I've been doing resistance stretches for a LONG time, and these are the best straps I've ever used. They're worth the price of admission

This mat is great.  My advice for all you yogis that can't keep your hands from reenacting Starsky and Hutch during downdog is to be a little patient or just creative.  You have two options other than getting upset and throwing your new (expensive) mat in the back corner of your closet.  First, I recommend that you buy an organic degreaser.  Give your mat a couple of sprays (not too much), give it a scrub with a brush, hose it off, and hang it out to dry.  This should help.  Option two is to put your mat in the washer on delicate cycle with cold water and baking soda.  Don't use soap unless you really want to be embarrassed the next time you start sweating in your sun salutes.  I put my mat in the washer and haven't had any problems, but I'm not sure if Manduka would actually endorse that.  With that, and a little bit of wear and tear, you should end up with a solid mat.

The directions for this product were userfriendly which made the calibrations easy to set up. However, at times the product is very sensitive and reacts to any kind of movement (i.e. driving to work...??) Therefore, for the most part,  its very efficient and the benefits of knowing how many steps I take each day has been invaluable.

i've had this gun a little over a mounth now and it still works great. don't bother useing the scope though it's a peace of junk the guns not acurit enough for it anyway. this gun is great for mid range rapid fire don't get this gun if u want a sharpshooter. the folding stock was broken when i got it but a little bit of vel crow fixed that easy. the strap also broke but a zip tie fixed it. don't get me wrong this it a tugh gun it's been drop, banged up and runs like new. so yea get it!!!!

Allright, thuis gun is so much more than i was hoping for. its accurate, and its an incredible price. its pretty hard hitting. i was putting holes in a cardboad box from 50 feet away.
im not new to airsoft, and i really wish that my first gun was as nice as this one
if you take it out to have a little fight with your friends, i reccommend extra clips.
the mag capacity is about 45, and the load time is annoyingly long
a very good gun for all abilitie

I purchased the light and medium resistance bands over a month ago and they are still going strong! I use them a couple times a week during my pilates workout and they work perfect.

We bought this for our 8 year old son for Christmas. He absolutely LOVES It! It goes just fast enough and is well designed for a comfortable ride. Brakes work very well. Riders need to start off slow and get a feel for the turn radius. Given the chopper style, long nose...quick tight corners usually mean you are in for a fall. 
I suggest getting a motorcycle style riding helmet for safety.
Easy to put together... a no brainer.
Well worth the cost. 
He told us he loves feeling the wind in his face, shirt sleeves flapping...I think we have started something I may not want to deal with as he gets older. Future Harley riders look out!

I am a 71 yrs young female. I purchased these "Men's" skates for myself. I bought a size larger and they are very comfortable. As an older "re" learner these skates worked out just great. The wheel's don't have speed, which is what I was looking for. They are indoor // outdoor skates. They work better for inside skating. A great price and a great quality skate. Especially for a beginner (the Wheels). No matter what age you are, these skates are the best. I love these skates

I bought this watch for the altimeter for climbing in Colorado - I recently went in January and it worked nearly perfect! Every location I could find an elevation marker, the watch was within 10 feet. The thermometer works well also, it just cannot be on your wrist to read the temp correctly.

The watch looks great, I wear it to work nearly every day. I would highly recommend it

I bought the X-Lander because I am a pilot and wanted a bit more information when I needed it. The watch is well designed and of good quality. A few things did disappoint me, but I think they are outweighed by the features, however.

- It appears that it does not have a second time zone. Why they would not include this is beyond me. As a pilot I want local time in 12hour format and zulu time in 24hr format. A traveler would want time here and at home. It is not there, but is on other models they offer.

- The dial is not the easiest to read and I had to use a magnifier to see the units information on setup such as feet vs. meters and celsius vs. farenheit. The display needs to be more vivid. The company does offer a white face with black numerals, which might be better.

It is a nice watch, but not the greatest execution of the concept, especially for $300

this gun is awsome it is the best gun you will ever get for such a good price and guns that are 10 20 or even 30 dollars more the gun is very very light and looks great you can take of the front  and the arm rest to make it look like as machine gun or something scope is great and is a super accurate gun i have shot a can down from farther than 40 feet (one shot) the laser is not super good and hard to use but it comes seperate so you can put it on or take it of whenever a bb might ratle around in their once in a while but it will fall out over all greatest gun ever!!

I am the leader of a team called POINT 0 I got this gun about a week ago it rocks my socks. It shoots about 300fps or maybe a little more. The scope is ok and the laser pointing thing isnt to hot but it gives you an estamite at night. It holds 21 pellets and doesnt go out very fast the cocking thing is at the top. But do not use this in a war with automatics you wont compare unless your sniping. I am the leader of point 0 and this gun rocks

I've been shot by many other airsoft guns, but this one really packs a punch...my back looked like it had measles after fully automatic. The automatic really drains the battery quick though and when its dead, it will scare you that you broke it, but no, it's just the dead battery. The metal gear box is extremely reliable and helps it shoot fast. This gun is a little overwhelming when looking at it to assemble, but be patient, it's actually easier than it looks. I highly recommend this gun

This lunch box is top quality, with lots of room for snacks and even lunch for two.  The quality is superior and I highly recommend it.  There is an area for your flatwear, salt and pepper shaker and other compartments for snacks.  There is even a compartment for your soda.   I have been shopping around for a quality lunch bag and this one is it.   Great for travel, work and picnics for two

I feel this product provides excellent Value for the occasional biker or hiker. While cycling I had filled the hydration bladder with water and ice. I also carried a 32oz bottle of gatorade in the the storage area. There was still plenty of room for snacks, keys, clothes etc. I purchased a Sony portable CD player/radio. It fits nicely in a special compartment with the headphone wires coming out of a slot in the top of the pack. My radio also has a remote which is great when you don't want to stop. 

The chest and waist straps hold the pack comfortably yet snugly to your body so it is not bouncing around.

The one negative that would report is the bladder hook. Rhis is what the bladder suspends from inside the pack. I think it should have a latch or something to hold it more securely. What I found is that when you take it off, it may slip off and then it pinches the hose which prevents drinking. I try to keep the velcro that closes that part of the pack close to the hook. This seems to help.

Overall though I am very pleased with my purchase.

These cars can be summed up in two words FUN and LOUD.  I have two and my four year old loves it and so do all his friends.  They work great throughout the house and hold their charge really well.  I am even thinking of getting a third.  They do leave little marks on the wood floors but it cleans easily.  Well worth it.

When the buggie arrived, it didn't work. I had to call Razor's Customer Service Dept. Their service is awful. The Senior Agent was very rude. I managed to figure out the problem on my own. The electrical unit was not connected. Once it was connected, it worked fine. We have two of them. The kids love them. They are lightweight and ride well on carpet. Overall, the product is good.

Hot water in my flask doesn't stay hot enough for a whole day out, and this is a good way to bring my tea or coffee up to temperature. I haven't tried heating water from cold - it is always at least warm when I start. It takes several minutes and the wait can be a bit tedious, but it does a good job. The clip which is supposed to hold the heater onto the side of the mug doesn't (it flops about), so I have to hold it to keep it properly immersed. It cools off quickly and is reasonably easy to clean with a small brush

This is the first Cathe strength workout I've tried, and I found it to be intense and challenging without being gruelling.  However, keep in mind that this is an advanced workout, so intermediates like myself will probably need to lift less weight than Cathe (I generally used 1/2 to 2/3 of what Cathe was using) in order to complete the workout.  Cathe uses a variety of equipment in this workout, including a barbell, several sets of dumbbells, a full club step, and a toning band, but I was able to get by without the barbell, step, or band (although my modifications may have further lowered the intensity of the workout).

The main workout on Muscle Max is 68 minutes long, but the DVD also offers several premixes:  Upper Body Only (42 minutes), Upper Body Push-Pull (33 minutes), Lower Body Only (23 minutes), and Timesaver (56 minutes).   The full workout breaks down as follows:  Warm-Up, Lower Body, Chest, Back, Lower Body, Shoulders, Bicep, Tricpes, Core and Stretch (the DVD includes subchapters under each of the above categories; see Cathe's web site for a full list of exercises plus video clip).  During the warm-up, you are constantly moving rather than performing static stretches, but I liked that Cathe still managed to thoroughly stretch each muscle group that was going to be worked.  Also, Cathe constantly varies the count, which adds interest as well as varying intensity to each movement.  Another thing I liked about this workout was that Cathe allows plenty of time between exercises, thereby providing you with an opportunity to rest AND to change your weights as needed.  I also enjoyed the upbeat music, some of it vocal.

Overall, this routine left me feeling completely worked out, yet not exhausted, which means that it was enjoyable and has little dread factor.  I think that both advanced exercisers and intermediates who are will to modify can get a great workout from this video--highly recommended

A great multifunctional stove with lots of room.  Extremely functional with three burners and the side flaps helped keep the wind, dust, and other campground debris out of your food.  Propane is the only way to go when you're cooking in the wild Woods were doing some backwoods camping.  While the stove has lots of room for cooking it folds down nicely making it a great compact pack along.  A must-have for any camping trip

This bike computer tells you all the things you really need to know without giving you a whole bunch of stuff that would only complicate its use.  It is simple to install.  Works great.  Is easy to navigate.  And, is actually kind of fun to use.  I love being able to get a small report of my bike ride like average speed, distance, etc.  And, when I'm whipping down the trail I really like to look down and see how fast I'm going or get other statistics without having to stop and push a bunch of buttons

This bench is a must have for outdoor sports. This is the second instabench we have bought as the other one wore out.  It is sturdy and can comfortably fit a coach along with many players on this bench.  The bench itself is a little heavy and bulky but portable enough to throw into the car and go.  The frame is made well.  There were only two issues that I had with the bench.  The first is that the plastic material on the bottom of the seat separated from the top seating material.  Second is the carrying case ripped after a few months of carrying it back and forth to the fields. The top sides ripped along with where the shoulder strap meets the material on the bag.     therefore the rate of 4 stars

I bought this helmet for my 3 year old.  He likes it, it seems to fit well, seems to adjust fairly easily, received good reviews from Consumer Reports.  The only thing I don't like about it is the chin straps seem to twist a little bit between the ears and chin.  My son hasn't complained about this being uncomfortable, but it looks like it might possibly be.  I can't see any way to straighten them out all the way from ears to chin, it's just the way they are attached to the helmet.  Generally though, I am very happy with it.
Oh, another thing, in the photo, the helmet looks almost red, white, and blue.  It's really dark gray and black.  I think the photo doesn't show this actual helmet but the design (style and stars) are the same

I have camped for several thousands of nights in all types of weather.  Over the years I have had a wide range of camp cots including the same style as the xl camp cot but not the same size.  This cot will provide everthing that I'm looking for.  My sleeping bag is wide and fits very nicely on the cot.  The cot is eazy to set up and take down and fits nicely in the handy carring bag.  The only down side to the cot is it's not a back pack cot but again neither is my sleeping bag.  In short it's all a good fit and I hope to enjoy it for years to come.   Thanks Da

My daughter is 2 1/2 years old, 32 lbs. and I wanted to get back into jogging.  After reviewing many strollers I decided on this one for it's price and features (swivel front tire, rubber tires, tray for myself and my daughter-snacks and juice keep her from getting antsy on my runs).  I wasn't sure if she would be too big for a jogging stroller but she fits very comfortably in this one and hasn't complained during any of my runs.  It handles great too!!  My only complaint is that I have not found it as easy as other reviews say it is to fold up.  I have a SUV so it has not been a problem, but I must say for me it does not fold flat at all and I am not sure it would fit into a trunk. But, most reviews have have said it folds easy. Not sure what I am missing, but..

I bought this coffee pot for home use in utter disgust with drip coffee makers.  Having had three different drip coffee makers stop working in one year, I decided to go with something tried and true.  And while you can't set it up to turn on by itself, I will never have to replace it again.  The color is beautiful.  It is a snap to clean up (just throw it in the dishwasher).  And, the coffee tastes so much better.  I now use less than half the amount of coffee grounds needed by a drip maker and am getting more flavorful, robust coffee and no bitterness.  I guess this is one thing that modern technology can't top.  I will never go back to and electric coffee maker

The basket is still cute...it just doesn't match my daughters bike as well as the other color would have.  I am sure she will love it just as much!  I just wanted to give everyone the heads up!

This is a real good ramp. I just got mine and me and my dad are going to build a roll-in ramp to put in front of it so you can come down it and get some major air! Overall a really good ramp besides the fact that it sometimes may move just a little but nothing major. It is good for even people who have been skateboarding for long time. They are fun and you will have hours of fun!!! :):):

I looked in Consumer Reports for the best treadmill for my dollar and deceided to buy this model. I absolutly love it! It was very well priced through Amazon.com and I thought the shipping was very fast.(About two weeks which is not much considering the weight). It is very heavy and well constructed. It does need to be put together, but I did it with my twelve year old daughter in about an hour with no difficulty. Everything is so well laid out for you, and the instructions were great! The treadmill is comparable to fitness center models! Very easy to operate. The folding is easy and it comes down very gently. I am very pleased with the Bowflex series 3 treadmill in every aspect and I thank Amazon for making it available for such a good price and free shipping to boot!

A quality product. Low to the ground so very hard for a little one to tip over. Easy to assemble. Can't wait for the snow to disappear so we can take it outside! Have been riding it inside, mostly using our legs (we're not yet 2 yrs old) to scoot around. However, our bigger cousin (just turned 5 yrs old) had a blast with it and could still peddle without grinding his knees into the handle bars. This trike will last a long time and thru many kids

Very impressive, though it's a bit big for my two-year-old. He can't reach the peddles yet, but manages to push himself around without too much trouble. I think the size is really more appropriate for a three year old, or a BIG two-year-old. Seems solidly built, very sturdy/stable and sporty looking

This little trike is wonderful!!!  My 2 1/2 year old loves it, as does our 5 year old neighbor.   The ride is smooth, and the low center of gravity allows for the racer instinct of most toddlers, without the high risk of tipping over.  I looked for a trike for many hours/days, and am so happy with this choice

This is a pretty good quality pack for the money. It looks good and feels well built. The height adjustment is a little tricky to adjust until you get used to it. It uses velcro panels to hold itself in place (plus a locking strap to secure it once it's adjusted) and you need to pull them both out to be able to adjust it up or down. It was very comfortable to wear over the course of my very first 2 day backpacking trip. My only real complaint with this pack is that one of the accessory loops on the bottom of the pack which was securing my tent to the outside of the pack ripped about 3 hours into the first day, which required me to figure out another way to carry my tent. Fortunately there are plenty of extra loops/pockets to hold things and clip thing on with and I was able to use those to secure my tent to the pack. So you do get what you pay for but this is probably one of the better packs out there in this price range.

Great fun way to practice chipping in my backyard.  It provides a great way of having a backyard practice chipping game with my friends.  Another product that I found quite valuable is

"The Ultimate Golf Instruction Guide: Key Techniques for Becoming a Zero Handicap Golfer or Better" by Patrick Leonardi
This book has very practical information on the short game and long game, which lead to my improvement on the golf range and on the golf course.  

For leisure reading, I also suggest
"New Rules: Polite Musings from a Timid Observer"  by Bill Maher
This book is hilarious, very funny observations about famous people in the world

I bought this bottle after reading a review that claimed it kept ice for 24 hours.  My girlfriend unwrapped the box on Christmas day, and filled it that afternoon.  It had ice still 2 days later.  Sturdy, effective, and comfortable to drink from.  

I'm going to buy myself one too.

I can't not imagine having a great machete, and it's easy for me to imagine many things I would want one for. This one is cheap, not very big, and of good-enough quality and the kukri style is great for cutting brush, chopping, and would be fine of fighting too, if you had too. Truly, unless you have more money you want to spend on a machete, or really don't need one because you never leave your house out of fear and don't play Jumanji or perhaps you have no arms...this machete is for you!

With care...chop on...chop on...

This was a present on our girls 3rd birthday... She rode off an on from 2 until 9 She loved it so much we couldn't wait for the battery to run out. For the rest of the day she would only stop long enough open another gift then back to the car.  Quick to learn how to drive it... Loud?? a little bit but hey, it's a kids toy.  If they didn't make noise, the kids wouldn't like it.
Great Toy!! Great Value!

55cm is for people as tall as 5ft-5". So this works great for my wife but not for me. She is pregnant and so safety was my number one criteria for selecting this. This is an amazing anti-burst ball.

I love this Ab Wheel, but some of the reviews here are ridiculous, like when a woman claims it burned off 20 pounds in a month. That's  72,000 calories, or 2400 calories a day. To put that in perspective, you'd have to run 24 miles a day, every day, to take off 20 pounds in a month just through exercise.

Let's say you can use this devise for 3 minutes before you tire out. Heck, give it the benefit of the doubt say 5 minutes. That means it might burn off 50 calories a day. If you did that every day (unlikely, because your abs would want some rest), you could burn off just under half a pound in a month. And that's based on some pretty optimistic assumptions.

So it's not a weight loss device. But it IS a great ab strengthener, better than anything else I've use. It'll tighten up your stomach like crazy, and as long as you do some cardio to burn and keep the fat off, you'll end up with a great, flat, ripped up stomach.

Can't really go wrong here.  A metal post, some rubber grips, and a couple of wheels.  It works great, and was the cheapest I found.  

Just a tip, if you've never used it before, don't try to be a tough guy and do a rep from your feet.  You may be tough, but you might also hurt your back.  Start on your knees until you know for sure you're a tough guy

The Good:
* I couldn't find these in bricks-and-mortar stores at all, and it was a relief to purchase them affordably through a vendor I trust.
* The 1-lb weight inserts make it easy to adjust the weight, with the cuff on or off.
* I have been using them for about two weeks, and the effect on my workout - and my legs - is tremendous.

The Bad:
* The cuffs are "adjustable" with two LONG velcro straps that wrap all the way around the ankle.  No matter how carefully I wrap them, I just can't get them as tight as I'd like.  Straps which wrap  double back through D-rings would have been much more useful.
* The cuffs tend to ride down and dig into the tops of my feet. Cushioned by gel or not, I can't exactly call that "comfortable."  I'm not sure whether this is specific to this brand, or typical of ankle weight cuffs.

Overall:
I do wish I'd been able to try these and some other brands before I purchased them.  However, I'm delighted to have found them and with the results I'm seeing

I was taking Hydroxycut but it stopped working.  GNC lady told me to switch to this.  First it worked GREAT, then about half a bottle down it stopped working.  Had to take more and more.  Went back to GNC.  Told me that anything like this will work when you first start and you have to start switching it up or taking more and more, and more, and more.  Told me I should switch product every one to two months.  Just wanted to recommend that you don't stock up on just one.  It will work for a while but plan on changing once you don't feel the effects anymore

They are made so well, operate smoothly all the time and fit so many useful features into a small package.  The other review about them just doesn't hold water.  You can open the knife with a few keys attached without a problem.  The keyring has to be on one end or the other,  but it is really not a hindrance

While there are those who will deride this product as an "air matress with sides" it is really a lot of versitile fun for the dollar. It gets you on the water cheaply and efficiently. It packs down small. I've had mine for the past three years, and have taken it on all sorts of water, from calm ponds to pretty big waves in rivers with fairly strong current. I've never had a problem. It holds me and my now 6 year old daughter perfectly. It replaced my old canoe and it has the following advantages:
1) the bag fits easily in the trunk of my compact sedan
2) I don't have to worry about the boat flying off the top of my car on the freeway
3) the bag fits easily in the trunk of my compact sedan.

It is seaworthy - I have even taken it out on Lake Superior (on a very calm day) and on day paddles into the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. I love it.

The "traditional" spork never impressed me much. This thing is a spoon with a USEFUL fork on the other end and a serrated knifelike bit that might come in handy here or there. Consider - the spork's obvious habitat is eating typical backpacker food when packing, typical microwaveable foodstuffs at the office, or the stuff in your wide-mouth vacuum bottle at the field jobsite. The Light My Fire Spork fits the bill to perfection

I was hoping for more of an around the wrist type Lanyard but this is around the neck and the clasp was not to my use. I needed it for the use of carrying around USB Flash Memory, but the clasps where to large to fit into the holes made for smaller Clasps. I would say these are still nice for the gym teachers and ref's out there that need them for the whistles

This litle gadget has come in handy on a number of occasions.  It's collapsable, strong, light and easy to use.  I wish the price was under $[...], but the best price I could find was on Amazon.com and it's what my wife wanted and loves.  We also bought one each of these for our grown children and they use them constantly.  A GOOD PRODUCT!!

This is the best racquet I ever have. I'd been using Wilson for a long time (5 racquets) This one is the lightest and the most powerful. I have improved a lot. And no more pain in my elbow (tennis elbow) Thank you for such a great product

 This spring is of industrial strength. It can definitely support a heavy weight punching bag of 75 to 150 lbs. Better than any made available at your local hardware store. It's only about 4 in. long so it does not take up much space. However,if your ceiling/beams are not structurally sound, no spring coil can adequately prevent damage to them by absorbing the shock of using a heavy bag

I am writing this review primarily to let people know what to expect from this product, since Amazon/Toys R Us don't seem to have a clue - even the image was provided by a thoughtful customer. I bought this in-store at Toys R Us because sizing information was not available online (except for the size of the box, for some bizarre reason) and I didn't want to take a chance with getting the wrong size. So let me share that information with you - this helmet is suitable for head sizes from 20.5" to 22". I think overall that this is a great set, but I marked it down a point because it does not include elbow protection. From my own experience learning to skate or even snowboard, I can say that I would generally fall onto my knees or the heels of my hands, so knee pads and wrist guards would be perfect for me. But with a young child who knows?! This is for my neice (I am not a parent) and whilst I am generally happy with the set as it is, I think it would be nice to include the elbow protection (which is afterall available in other sets, but does not appear to be available separately) to make a complete safety package. Perhaps we are supposed to buy and extra set so we have the elbow pads and two sets of knee pads, or perhaps I am a touch too cynical

I recently purchased the tent cot and decided that it would be best to have the rain fly to go along with it. The rainfly fits snuggly with elastic corners. Also, there are straps that attach to the ends of the cot with clips. The sides tie down in four places to prevent it from flying around when you don't have it fully zipped up. My only gripe and the reason it doesn't get five stars is that I think it should have just come with the tent cot in the first place rather than having to order it separately

I recently purchased the GoFit 40lb weighted vest, and it's everything I hoped it would be. I was looking to add weight to my speed walking workouts, and this vest has proved to be a good choice. The weight is balanced well between front and back of my body. The shoulder straps are comfortable and have given me no problems in hourlong walks. The velcro straps are adjustable to fit all but the largest of waists to insure a snug fit and no movement. I have even used the vest when working in the yard and weight lifting, though it does hamper some bending movements. The weights can be taken out if you need to make it lighter. I am well pleased with my purchase

This scooter seems better than the basic one because it is sturdier. It also has a fender type bracket over the back wheel so she can rest her foot without inadvertantly pressing on the brake. It can be a little difficult for a child to fold and unfold. She is 10 and got it for her birthday

The scooter ride is really smooth! FAST transportation and really fun down hills. The breaking is pretty nice and I like the wheelie bar too. You guys will love it - get it! People say scooters are only for little kids, but I'm 18 and i'm loving scootering around campus to classes and etc. Everyone does it and it really holds more than 143 lbs

MSR's Pocket Rocket is a great little cooker.  Best for going light and fast. Perfect as a shared stove among two people, and even better for simple boiling or melting snow for drinking water. I would suggest this stove for use with a maximum pot capacity of two liters, more than this and it becomes a little unstable.
If your menu is simple and you live on instant meals that require only boiling water this is the stove for you. Because this is a stove designed for the minimalist, it is tiny and has a very concentrated hot spot, so if you are a backcountry gourmet and want to cook pancakes and eggs you might be better off with a stove that has a larger flame spread.  Again, great for boiling water and melting snow, but not for actual cooking

I looked at many different variations of Swiss Army Knife before I decided on this one.  I couldn't be happier!  This has an excellent variety of tools for everyday jobs (the screwdriver heads, the small blade, the scissors), and it's great for outdoor use at picnics, camping, or canoeing (the saw blade, the large knife, the toothpick).  There are still a few tools I haven't used, but overall, this is one of the best mixes of tools for the money

Any bag that doesnt have a stand will not be perfectly stable without movement.  Just the way it is.  So if you think you can by pass this point, than forget it.  But if your looking for a bag with a little more freedom to move because of space or living arrangements than you will be happy with this one but you got to remember its freestand.  

The biggest debate is water or sand?  does it really make a difference?  The best tip I can give is not matter of which one but what's under the bag that helps the most from keeping it sliding on the floor when in use.

When considering water or sand.... water is easier to empty out than sand but sand doesnt evaporate or get moldy.  
 
If you have purchased this bag and your not happy because it is freestand, than forget the freedom of movement and fill the base with cement, there's an answer for everythin

These clubs are great for a starter.  The best part is the price.  I wasn't sure if I would really like playing so I didn't want to go out and spend a fortune.  I found these clubs in the store and they were well over $100, so I went with Amazon and got free shipping.  The clubs arrived much sooner than expected and I paid a lot less!  I am very happy with my purchase

Typical Aegs shoot 280-310 and most fields that are moderated have a 350 fps limit so 400 fps aegs is great if u wanna play by yourself or in a non official place.....i also sure hope that a sniper can shoot 500 being they are normally single shot.....theyre not in the same categlory so your not comparing apples and apples.... this is a very nice gun....it is expensive for the parts included and the functionality...this gun is defidently not a beginner gun so i only reccomend it for people who have owned 2 or more aegs previously (AEG-TM ICS ,CA, AIM M4,G&P,G&G,Ect...

Another reviewer said: 
I think this product needs a few improvements, but in all it is a strong value proposition. 

Here's what I would improve if I were in charge: 

1. A higher resolution screen so that the GUI could present more information. 
2. Macintosh compatibility. 
3. The PC cable should be included. As it stands, the cable and PC software costs nearly as much as the device itself. 

I say: 
As far as the higher resolution goes, I wouldn't want the print to be any smaller, especially if you have to deal with direct sunlight otherwise you would be hard pressed to see the readout. 

Concerning issue 2 & 3 I have no comment because I did not purchase the software. 

However concerning the unit itself, I have noted the following improvements which will allow me to grade this product 5 stars. 


Noted suggestions for modification to the eCaddy. 

1. The clip should remain, however the eCaddy should be attached to the clip via a strong pull cord. This will allow quick and easy interaction to the eCaddy. (I have to suck in my gut to work the eCaddy while it is on my belt.) 

2. The order of the "Hole/Par/Handi" buttons should be switched to "Handi/Par/Hole". Again, this will allow for quick and easy interaction to the eCaddy due to the respective position of the "Player" buttons. 

3. A thin plastic slot simular to the "Player Name Slot" should be added to the back of the eCaddy so the user can insert a card with the abbreviate names of selective Golf courses. It is very difficult to remember the name of #1, #2 ~ #10. 

4 THIS IS A BIG PLUS AND SHOULD BE A MAJOR CONSIDERATION: The players default score should automatically be set to the value of par for the hole. 

This will certainly please the user of the eCaddy. Currently, I will preset the values before we tee off because I know No One will get a "Hole in One" on a Par 5 hole. It is very unlikely that they will get a "Hole in One" on a Par 4 hole and it is rare to get a "Hole in One" on a Par 3 hole. This way it is possible to not have to be as busy with the eCaddy for many holes. 

Before this product came along, I had created a spreadsheet that I uploaded to my Palm Pilot which worked well but was very difficult to read in the sunlight and tedious to use the pen to keep track of the scores while keeping up with the pace of play. 

As far as the price is concerned, I feel it's about right if you were able to purchase the unit locally. Depending on who you purchase it from, after shipping and taxes you may spend close to $60. I would feel very comfortable spending $50 tops for this product. 

Nonetheless, the eCaddy was a definite blessing.

Just the perfect cap!. It fits like no other swimming cap. It won't pull you hair when removing it, neither will slip a bit from your head after swimming several laps or flip turning. Very resistant material, and a great finish. Awesome colors!

I bought this as a Christmas gift for my brother in law, but after he opened it, we all tried it on. I have very fragile, long hair and normally swim caps rip the hair out when I'm trying to put the swim cap on or take it off. This one came on and off so easily, without any hair-pulling

I'm on my 5th cap now I think.  Silicone is great and lasts forever.  Unlike rubber (which can snag hair) and latex (which some people are allergic to) silicone fits smoothly over wet hair, has a glossy finish so it looks great and doesn't lose elasticity. I have a some advice if you want to try this product that I've learned overt the years:
1. Always rinse and hang dry.  I've left wet caps in my gym bag and after a month of two of neglect, it develops black spots. I don't know if it's mold, it doesn't wash off...and you'll have to buy a new cap if you don't like the spotted look.
2. Pull it on gently.  I've ripped one when I was trying to stretch it over my head because my long nails cut right through it. It's not cloth so you have to be careful. This goes for latex and rubber, too.
3. Wet your hair first.  If your hair is dry when you put it on, you will trap air under the cap.  And since it's not a permeable material, the cap will start to come off while you swim because of the air trying to escape inside.  
4. Pick a fun color.  
That's it.  Have a great swim

This is something that I have wanted for a very long time.  When I first starting seeing the Bowflex on those terrible TV Infomercials, I thought, "Wow, what a piece of garbage."  Later on, while serving in the US Air Force over seas, my squadron had managed to tactically acquire one.  Along with the rest of our daily regiment of physical training, a few of us would spend half an hour or so each on this odd looking apparatus.  It quickly became obvious that this was, in fact, not a piece of garbage.  Just as the few of us using it were showing some impressive results and starting to convince the rest of the squadron of its worth, we were deployed to various points of interest throughout the Middle East.  When we returned, the Bowflex was gone and we were all very upset about it.

It has been a few years now, and I have since left the service.  I sent my body into a sort of accelerated atrophy alongside a bit too much of partying, to include too much drinking and too much eating.  I recently re-started some of my training, but I could only describe my progress as slow.  Then I came back to the Bowflex, found a good price for it on Amazon, and went for it.

It takes a while to set up, so unless you are patient and fairly adept to the use of Lego's, I would suggest that you not expect to use it the day you get it.  If you do, as I did, I would suggest that you start out slow, as I did not.  I went with one of my old routines, which pretty much kicked my back side for about three days (and after only one workout).  The machine comes with a variety of assembly, workout, diet, and overall health aids.  Keep in mind that the weight loss guarantee only counts if you follow their workouts and diet plans closely.

Now for the only part that matters.  Here it is:  It works.  Now here's the disclaimer:  It only works if you work.  Just like any other machine, weight set, pair of running shoes, etc. this machine is nothing unless you routinely use it for a workout.  If you already have a few machines sitting around you house that have, say, clothes drying on them, then this is not for you.  Don't spend the money on this if you can't stick to a routine.  Just buy a nice TV and sound system.  If you can stick to a routine, this is perfect.  If you want it to work a bit better, add a little cross training, such as running or swimming

The Bowflex is a replacement for one of the older models(original, by Schwinn)that my husband has used consistently for 12 years. It came in one huge box, and took the two of us half a day to put together. The directions and diagrams were pretty clear. One piece was broken, but they sent out a new one within the week and it is now complete. They have changed the power-rod holder, so we can't salvage most of the old ones. My husband did figure out a way to position two 50-lb rods into the new slots so he could use more resistance. It is not as compact as the older model, but it does fold up somewhat. Overall, he is very pleased with this purchase-- we paid less for this one through Amazon than we did in 1995

I got this a few years back, and it is a very important member of our household still! My wrist was smashed in an auto accident many years ago and i no longer have the ability to hold free weight above my neck... the possibilities are atrocious. With the bowflex if i let go for any reason the potential catastrophe is avoided.

There is no stress or strain except for the muscle group you are trying to focus upon. Well made, well designed, and very well built. Like our Dyson vacuum, this is a quality product utilizing quality engineering. It may be perfect for the elderly or female/male non bodybuilder athlete because of it's non need for a spotter and the ease of changing resistance!

I am happy with my build, i don't want to be bodybuilder, if you do this may not be the correct machine for you... like it is for me at 43!

that is my opinion, and like all the others... i'm sticking to it!

thank you for your tim

Gloves are toasty...perform as expected, and are a sweet luxury after a long, cold day on the slopes; HOWEVER, the D-SIZED batteries (1 per glove) are considerably more bulky than what I expected.  Most reasonable people would anticipate having to use 3 or 4 AA batteries...but no, just one, bit fat chicken-roastin' D-sized battery.  Good product, but consider whether wearing the big ol' D's around your wrist all day will get on your nerves, or whether you'll barely notice, being bundled-up and bulkified anyway.  May also interfere with cinching up your jacket sleeves when it's really nippy out.

If you notice that when an item is that cheap on ebay that the shipping charge is always Huge to more then make up for the difference. Yes it is "cheaply made and not designed to last", but so are all similar products, so it is at least par for the course in that regard. Just trying to even out the review, I didn't think the other review was fair

I think that the sword itself is great, the casing is cool, and the mounting wood is nice. The only things I didn't like was that the keychain, Greiver, fell off once I took it out of the box.

I also wish there were instructions for installing the mounting wood to the wall and gunblade.

Otherwise, I think that I got an amazing deal

If you aren't prepared to use the Swing Setter a couple of times a week for ca. 5-10 minutes each time, you probably won't get the benefit it has to offer.  The CD and literature do a very good job of helping you to define your training regimen to which you need to add only the discipline to execute it on a regular basis.  The effects it has had on me are as follows:  a) despite my impression that my grip was solid, it forced me to assume a stronger, more compact grip that has helped me with my tendency to fade the ball; b) it has helped me to revert to being more of a hitter than a swinger (which I used to be when I was playing better) by forcing me to increase the speed of my swing (especially the backswing) and to delay release thus stopping my tendency to "cast".  The quality of construction is excellent; I can't imagine wearing it out although, I see that the magnets can lose strength over time.  My main problem has been with a looping swing - inside to outside.  So far, the Swing Setter does not seem to address this problem; I can still loop and have the magnets release at the desired time.  I would think some of the other "hinged" swing trainers would be a better help with this problem.  I do recommend the Swing Setter if for no other reason that if you have the discipline, it will serve as a conditioning device to use during the off-season.  Good luck

This is probably the most complete training aid that covers set up, swing plane, grip and tempo. However i still need video and PGA pro to correct my swing. Here is the fault that i found: i can snap the lower ball with flipping my left hand and coming steep on downswing. This is not a cure for all but it helps.
The other disadvantage is the magnetic force in the balls diminishes fast

I'm a 13 handicap and I've never bought a swing trainer before, but I saw the infomercial and thought it was worth a try. It arrived yesterday and I went through the warm-up and practice. First, the grip felt very uncomfortable. Over the years I had settled into a very comfortable and very incorrect grip. This device corrected it immediately, although I didn't know it at the time. After going through the routine described in the directions I went out to the backyard and hit wiffle balls. My grip still felt funny, but my tempo, swing path and release had improved 100% in just a few minutes. This morning I went to the driving range. The improvement was dramatic. My iron shots were longer and straighter, but that uncomfortable grip caused some stray shots with my driver. After about ten driver swings I got the hang of it... and... WOW! There's a screen out at 250 yards. On a good shot I usually hit it on one bounce. Today, I was hitting the screen 15 to 20 feet up off the ground.

Thanks David. I can't wait to get out on the course tomorrow

I am an avid golfer since the age of 18 and over the years, I have tried all the gizmos to get rid of my shots that drift to the right (or slice under pressure).  I have tried the Medicus, and still slice and other gizmos (swing jacket....junk) to no avail.  The swing setter worked for me.  It showed me a flaw in my grip (by the way, this flaw was not noted by several instructors and others I routinely play with) and also stressed cocking of the wrists to help get on plane.  I tried it and my shots immediately straightend out and now go straight or slightly left (still some over the top) but getting better every day.  I recommend combining this with the Swing Rite for a powerful swing.  You will still have to work with it a few times per week but it can be swung in the garage or back yard so you don't look like a goof on the range.  Give it a try, it is cheaper than most lessons and certainly helped me.  Good Golfing

This was another gift for my grandson's 1st birthday - he loves music, and is fascinated with the buttons on each side of the cube and enjoys pushing them - I'm not so sure he understands that he's adding instuments when he pushes each button, but as it lights up and the cube makes music, he totally enjoys the experience..

The Eureka kids 30'grasshopper is an awesome sleeping bag, and a great value. We have two girls ages 6 and 8 who we purchased the sleeping bags for. On an week long camping trip in early spring twice the temperature dipped into the thirtys, and once into the low thirtys. Our girls stayed toasty warm and comfortable in their grashopper mummy bags. These bags also pack well, and have a good zipper. For the money these bags simply can't be beat.

 	The sword itself is awesome to behold. Though the guard was only minorly spot welded and is loose from just a few minutes of play. No, I didn't hit anything. Blade is heavy, would look good if it were not scratched so bad. Can be polished up. If you know people to repair this, I suggest you do so. Cool sword, Chinese craftsmanship. Should you buy it? Hell yeah

With a job that is extremely sedentary, 3 days sitting all day at a desk, 2 days putting on 220 miles or more sitting in a car, this has been a  most welcome purchase. 
5 to 10 minutes on this each day, has greatly relieved my low back discomfort
to the point where I'm able to continue this heavy work schedule, in relative
comfort.

If compressed discs are your problem, you've got to try this, after first checking with your physician

I looked at several inversion tables before deciding on my Life Gear and have no regrets in buying it. I am 6'2" and weigh 220 lbs. and it performs beautifully for me. It is well built and the memory foam makes it comfortable to lay on. It was easy to assemble and took only a short time before I was using it. 
    I have found that just a few minutes will relax me and has helped my arthritis too.  I no longer have pain in my neck or between my shoulders. I would strongly urge people who have had back surgery to consult with their doctor before using any inversion table because they do stretch your back

This item in the green was on backorder which I didn't know when I ordered it. The seller offered to ship out a different color in this style but I really wanted the green and it was well worth the wait. 
Has scissors, tweezers, two blades (one has a file on it) and a toothpick. There's an attached ring for easy attachment to a key ring. The edelweiss flower design is clear and graphic - very pretty

With the entire market for rocker and wobble boards so overpriced for what you get, it's nice to see that you can get a quality product without paying 50%+ more.  Solidly built of high strength plastic/resin and rubber, I find this board much stronger and more comfortable than the wood ones.  I even told my chiropractor that the Thera-Band was better than what he had in his office that his supplier wanted to charge me $75 for.  It even comes with a nice brochure outlining the various exercises you can do with the board

I love this thing.  It was easy to assemble, everything just screws on and it even comes with a little needle pump!  Mine doesnt stay very well after you stop punching it or break the rythm. If you stick to the same rythm it doesnt pop off.  The suction cup holds very well but the back and forth motion causes one side to creep up slightly, and it therefore loses its suction.  I'd by it again in a second, despite this.  Would probably hold together if i put some tape around it like someone else suggested, but its not really a big problem for me.  People come to my desk and love it.  Greatest office accessory evAr

The previous reviewer provided a lot of good information about this DVD. I thought I would add a few additional comments. 

First, you get a lot of bang for your buck with these $50 Cathe DVDs - they are definately worth the money. This DVD has 3 full workouts - Boot Camp, Muscle Endurance and a Combo (of the 2). There are also a number of other options on the DVD menu.  

I workout regularly with a variety of videos/DVDs but I'm not that motivated when it comes to doing resitance training on my own. There is some light barbell work on sevaral of the Firm Cross Training videos but my barbells were mostly collecting dust. 

I found Cathe's DVDs when searching on Amazon. When I saw the description for this DVD it sounded like the perfect fit for the equipment I have but the price was really challenging. I decided to take a chance and go for it. Needless to say, I was very impressed and I even ordered another $50 Cathe DVD. 

If you have the equipment (barbells, dumb-bells, a High Step/Firm step and maybe even a medicine ball) and you enjoy an hour of resistance training, I would highly recommend this DVD. It's challenging for an experienced exerciser but it can easily be modified to to fit any other experience level. There is some intense ab work on this DVD too. If you don't have one, you might want to purchase the "Heavy Resistance TheraBand Exercise Band" for $7.49 through Amazon when you order this DVD. Cathe uses this also and the standard resistance tubing/bands aren't a good subsitute.

Although there is no price difference between Amazon and Cathe's website, when ordering through Amazon, the Cathe DVDs/Videos are shipped Priority Mail. On Cathe's website USPS is not an option so they won't ship to a PO Box. If you live outside the continental US their only shipping options are 1 or 2 day air so Amazon is a significant savings on the shipping if you live in Hawaii.

This inflatable kayak is functional and easy to transport given it's light wheight. Once inflated, it's easy to carry with just one arm when empty. It also has a very sturdy feel once it's completely inflated (I would recommend an electric pump that you can plug into your car battery charger).

With both seats in the kayak, there is suffient room and storage space for two adults and gear. I  have been using this kayak mostly for fishing with my four-year-old son on small lakes. We generally carry two fishing rods, gear box, bottled water, and other related items, along with a dry bag. Even with all this "stuff" in the boat there is plenty of room inside, and with the seats in place I have plenty of support and elbow room for paddling.

I haven't yet taken this kayak on down a creek or river so I'm not able to comment on its use in that scenario

This inflatable kayak is a hoot! I bought one yesterday and did about 12 miles on the Truckee River through Reno in it with my teenage son. (Yes, I am incredibly stiff and sore, and he's raring to go again.)

First of all realize that this does not handle like a hardbody kayak. Close, but not quite. It is just a pointy rubber raft, after all. It likes to go down the river sideways or backwards, depending upon where the heaviest bottom sits. But, it can be easily paddled by one or two persons to float just like the real thing.

About thirty years ago I used to have a fiberglass kayak and went down many rivers here in the western USA. I've worn wool long underwear under a wetsuit to stay warm and have almost lost camera gear and food in rollovers. I kinda know how to handle a kayak.

This Sevylor should not be taken through anything greater than a 4, depending upon the skill of the paddler. It rides like a typical rubber raft through crests and holes. It might be fun to play with solo in standing waves, but it would be hard to brace into because there are no foot/heel rests. There is no way to stay in it in a rollover. You'll just get dumped out.

On the practical side, it only weighs about 23 pounds, can be had for around $140, inflates easily and quickly with a plunger air pump (sold separately), is easily portaged around the rough water, has a very shallow draft, is made from some very tough PVC, is comfortable to sit in for several hours, is easy to dump water out of, cleans off quickly with just a hose, and deflates in a heartbeat to be folded back into the size of a medium suitcase. For us, it is perfect - affordable, handy in the waters we frequent, easy to inflate/deflate/store.

I'm thinking of getting another one so that he can have his own, and so that I won't get quite as splashed-on from his flailing paddling. He can also tow old mom on the wide slow parts.

Sue :)

This item is well made.  The tube is beefy and the handles are sturdy.  The included exercise booklets are lame. They have dated black and white photos showing disinterested people doing lack luster exercises.

Wow! I was really pleased with my purchase. I've never owned a heavy bag before so I didn't know what to expect. I just started martial arts so I wanted a bag to practice on, but I didn't have a lot of money to spend. This purchase was not only well within my price range, but the bag is high quality and includes a speed bag with gloves! The gloves aren't very padded, a boxer friend of mine told me the gloves included were really for use on the speed bag. The heavy bag comes filled and is very solid, the chain is heavy duty, and the connections for the chain on the bag are well attached with double stitching. I was a little uncertain about just what the Nevatear material was, now I know. My description would be a heavy duty nylon with a slight rubberized feeling. In my opinion better than the abrasive canvas bags, yet not as soft to the touch as a leather bag. Two other purchases I would recommend are a good set of padded gloves for use on the heavy bag (I purchased some padded grappling gloves) and for the speed bag you will need two things: (1) a swivel attachement (I bought the Everlast plastic ball swivel for about $15 at a local Academy Sports Store) and (2)you will need to make or purchase a backboard and stand or wall attachment (I made mine from 2 x 6's and 3/4" MDF). All in all, a GREAT purchase! I couldn't be happier

This kit also includes a speed bag!! The item description never mentions that.  Which is awesome, but I already ordered one because I thought this didn't have it.  However it is a small speed bag so keep that in mind.  The bag gloves are very "budget" just like they state. So I doubt they will last long.  The heavy bag is fully packed, so the box is about 70lbs.  Other than that this is an exceptionally good value esp. with the free shipping

I purchased these for my parents who are both in their 80's in order to bring some resistance training into their exercise programs.  My Dad takes 2 mile walks and manages the snow blower in the winter.  My mother does some treadmill walking.  They really enjoy using these bands and I think it is benefiting them.  They are simple to use and effective as if you work hard enough you can definitely feel it

This gun is really cool! It has decent aim, great fire power, and the charge lasts a long time. The only thing i find a little usettling is the fact that the clip only holds about 20 bb's at a time, but hey, you can't have everything. Anyways, great buy

This is the second Suunto Vector watch i have owned. Only because the first one was lost. The only two draw backs of this watch is battery life and my band broke twice in two years. Seems to me they could offer a much longer life battery and a band that would hold up alot better. the battery lasts about 6 months only.For the price of this watch ($230) you think tehy could do alittle better.

 Other than that i love the watc

This is a excellent product for certain needs. It is unmatched for ease of transport (I can easily carry four of them at once). The only drawback is that these tables are limited in how much weight they can hold. This makes perfect sense, of course. If they were sturdier , they would be heavier. A common sense approach to usage -- place heavier objects toward the ends and the legs rather than in the middle on the hinge -- will insure safety and longevity of the product. All in all, a very good value

Our family are backpacking campers.  We make a big deal out of loading our backpacks with everything we need while striving to keep them as light as possible.  I bought one My-Ti Titanium flatware set for my husband.  We all loved it so much that I ordered more for me and our son.  They are light weight, come with a link to keep them all connected, and we prefer them to the "sporks". When we aren't camping, they are in our lunch packs and/or picnic supplies. Amazon.com had them at the best price

My husband and his friend likes to hike and one day he and his friend met some people out of state--they wanted to share email address---no one had a pen/pencil so my husband's friend pulls out his pocket knife and inside it is a pen to write with.  Everyone was so excited to know there is a swiss army signature with a pen to write with inside.  
My husband looked everyone where in stores for this same knife set cause he wanted one just like it---could not find it so I did some searching on the net and bought it for his Christmas gift---he was so excited to receive it on Christmas morning.  Thanks

I've spent years camping with a bag of clothes half-strewn around my tent, so a new tent led me to check this out to see if I can stay organized.

The closet comes in its own thin carrying case.  It looks complicated at first opening, but it's easy to insert the fiberglass rods, zip down the corners, adjust the Velcro seams, and BOOM! you've got a very sturdy and roomy set of shelves for socks, shorts, t-shirts, towels, and medication.  There's a zip-down mesh cover to keep things out of your stuff yet keep it ventilated, and it rolls up out of the way.  Pockets on the sides for pop/beer cans, wallet, and the like are very handy, and hooks for keys on both sides let you keep things where you can find them easily.  There's even a pocket on the back that stores magazines and maps.  But the value is in keeping things organized, OFF the tent floor, where you can see that stuff without having to paw through a duffelbag and toss things all over your tent.  I'm happy to have found this neat piece of tent furniture

I live on a large college campus and have had my bikes stolen before, but with this lock I haven't had anyone even try to steal it.  It's not as heavy as I thought it would be (a plus) and it is pretty small so it can fit in just about any larger pocket.  It feels solid and looks strong too.  I would definitely buy this lock again if ever need be

These are definatly very accurate. The seem is barely visable. In pistols these dont really crack, but in my aeg rifle, which is 360FPS, these crack at close distance. But keep in mind these are light .12g's and .20g's a rerecommended for aeg's.
4 out of 5, nice polished accurate bb's

Most "replica" type weapons in this price range are just made to sit pretty on a shelf or wall, not these. Made out a single piece of stainless steel, these are very solid knives. As the previous reviewers stated, these do come very dull, but a file, a sharpener and a couple of hours can fix that. Once sharpened these knives are very useable

I would like to note I am NOT a fan of the Riddick movie, Though A blade this unique tends to get your attention reguardless! This knife is very practical, It's a solid piece of metal all around. I own a pair of these and used them on a grounded, wooden post for hours! Yet after my use they shown no sign of bends, Chips or dents! They shipped to me dull, But hey I don't mind sharpening them myself. A word of caution, You can seriously injure someone with these! Their odd form makes them very deadly if sharpened as well as mine are

This is a great little camp kitchen, just the right size without taking up a lot of room at the camp site. I have another camp kitchen bought from a well known outdoor supplier but it's massive in size and more suited for extended stays, the Guide Gear Camp Kitchen is perfect for weekend camping and shorter stays. It's compact both set up and in it's carrying bag, it'll take up hardly any space while traveling. Perfect size for a camp stove on the top table with a smaller propane or charcoal grill on the side table. The hanging pantry is strong and rugged with plenty of room to stock food, paper supplies, etc. This is a well thought out and designed kitchen and while compact has everything you'd need to enjoy the great outdoors. I highly recommend it...Buy it, try it.... You won't be dissapointed

I haven't used this camping, but I set it up in my living room as soon as I got it in the mail and it took about 2 minutes.  It looks great and I can't wait to try it out camping this summer with my family of five!!  I know exactly where I am going to put all of my camping dining essentials on this kitchen.

It's always satisfying to see that a determined manufacturer can significantly improve even the simplest of devices. It's a pleasure to hold and use this bottle.

I like:
* Not having to tip your head up to drink, since the mouthpiece is connected to a straw inside that goes to the bottom - I've never seen this design before
* Easy to flip open with one hand, yet you don't have to pull hard with your teeth like in standard designs
* Absense of taste compared to plastic bottles

I don't like:
* Diameter of the bottle is too wide to fit standard cage all the way. It takes a lot of force to push it in about 2/3 of the way and it doesn't go further. It hasn't flown out during riding yet, but I am looking for a wider cage now (not easy to find). Why not make it standard diameter for bike cages

 I'm a small person at 5'2", so this 24" Denali is perfect for me. I bought the 26" one and liked it, but it was too big, so gave that one to my husband.  The bike was easy to assemble, no problems with delivery, very quickly. I like the way the Denali shifting system so u can see what geer your in similar to my mountain bike. It Shifts smoothly rides very nice, this is my first road bike and am very pleased with it!

This is the best knife sharpening system I have ever owned. The kit has 2 medium sharpening rods, 2 fine sharpening rods, a booklet, a VCR instruction tape,& the plastic storage case which doubles as the base.
I can easily keep my Spyderco Delica knife razor sharp; also my Wusthof kitchen knives. (Even the serrated knives!) This kit takes all the guesswork out of keeping the right angle to sharpen your knives

As a hobbyist woodworker who works primarily with hand tools, I've had to learn how to put a razor edge on things like plane blades and chisels.  While I've managed to master that skill (can shave hair off my arm with these tools), putting a sharp edge on my kitchen knives has been a nightmare.  I've tried numerous methods, none of which has worked well.

About a year ago, I puchased the Spyderco sharpening kit.  Read the manual, watched the DVD, put my kitchen knives to it, and......ended up with pretty dull knives.  Frustrated, I put this kit in a kitchen drawer.

Fast-forward to last week.  The kitchen knives are dull again, and none of my sharpening systems work on the knives.  So, I pulled out the Spyderco again and gave it another try.  This time, I tried sharpening my serrated bread knife.  After just a few strokes, it was good as new.  So, I tried it on the straight knives again, but only got a modest increase in sharpness.  Now convinced that some of my kitchen knives are made from inferior stainless steel, I tried sharpening my Swiss Army Knife.  Again, after a few stokes on the Sharpmaker, I had a wicked sharp knife.

I was down in the workshop today, sharping my plane blades and chisels.  The last plane blade to sharpen was for a scrub plane...the blade on these is very convex, so sharping it is always a challenge.  Fortunately, it does not need to be super sharp, and never has been.  The Sharpmaker was sitting out, so I said "what the heck", and gave the scrub plane's blade a few freehand strokes on the Sharpmaker...no sharpening jig to hold the blade like I normally use.  For fun, I tried to shave hair off my arms....AND IT WORKED!  I couldn't believe it...this Sharpmaker makes sharpening TOO easy!

It's American-made, very well thought-out, and works amazingly well when your blades aren't made of junk steel.  What more could you ask for?

this is the best and easiest knife sharpener ever. you can sharpen anyting with it...but I use it mostly for knifes. any knife, serated, stainless, it works great on filet knives. it is quick and easy. I believe the brown stones are the key. they make getting a bad knife easy to sharpen. one you might think about taking to a grinding wheel , but in a few minutes the damn thing will be sharp enough to cut hair. best of all the knife will hold an edge after sharpened. I bought one of these 25 years ago. I still have it and it still works great. I had to buy one for the motor home. since I don't sharpen the knives in there before we go.
and once you have sharp knives you don't go back. I love this sharpener. mostly because my wife uses it too. we always have sharp knives. thanks for a great product!!  thanks Ti

the Jo is a popular fighting weapon in the orient.  It doubles as a fancy walking stick and can be displayed in a house as an artifact.  Getting hit with this would probably be like getting hit with a brick because it is approximately an inch in diameter.  this is a long weapon with some weight to it so it is best used for thrusting or using ones own motions against them.  I had a friend who perhaps put it best when he said " I never thought paying 20 bucks for a stick could be such a good deal "

This review is for Nike T-90 Club Team (32 panels)

I bought this ball for less than $15 thinking I couldn't go wrong. I hadn't used Nike balls before, so I didn't know what to expect. It turns out that this ball flies better, is softer, is rounder, and is better stitched than my more expensive adidas balls. Great practice ball, and pick-up game ball. I would have no problem using it in a small club match either. As far as my $30 adidas balls? Not a chance.

5 Stars based on performance vs. price. I hope you get as good a deal as I did (through Eastbay Athletics)

I recently recieved this gift as a birthday present.  The batteries that it came with had a little juice in them already, and since the directions said to discharge them completely before charging for the first time, I fired off a few dry rounds and a few BB's.  The blowback is quite impressive; I find myself shooting dry rounds just to see that nice blowback action.  The batteries are charged via putting them in the gun and attaching the charger to the pistol butt - so far, I've had no problems.  The gun looks and feels authentic.  I have not tried the flashlight during games just yet, though it seems very powerful (after shining it in my eyes accidentaly :p).  The main problem I had was with the magazine.  To get it out of the gun, you must pull it out; there is no magazine release button.  This wasn't too much of a problem for me, just new.  However, when I was loading the BB's into the magazine NORMALLY, the two halves of it popped open, sending the spring and BB's flying.  I put it back together and taped the sides together as reinforcement, and it works fine now.  Recommended for all not-so-hardcore players.

This is a very realistic pistol.  The blow back makes it look almost exactly like the real thing.  It's range isn't as far as rifles, but it still shoots across the yard.  When you got shot with them from 10 yards away, they still hurt a little.  One time, my dad, brother and I were battling in the front yard, and a lady in her car slowed down to see what we were doing

We just got this bag today for our son.  We got the short version of this bag, but I don't see that version on Amazon anymore.  The outside is a very nice rip-stop nylon material and soft and cuddly, and the zipper is very smooth.  The inside is a little scratchy, but I am sure it will be better after a washing.  The drawstring around the hood pulls nice and tight to keep out the air.  The only thing I was disappointed about was the color.  The picture on Amazon, and on the box it came in, is turquiose.  The bag is definitely NOT turquiose!  It is a darker blue - closer to navy - color.  And the yellow is more of a mustard color, not a bright yellow, and the inside is dark gray.  But my son likes it anyhow, and of course it doesn't affect the quality of the bag.  I like the fact that the hood turns inside out, too

This is a quite good item.  I looked at a number or similar items on amazon and this one seemed caught my eye.  It certainly does make drinking from a nalgene or similar (mine is actually from a different maker, but of the same style) much easier.  My only qualms are that it is slightly expensive for a simple piece of plastic.  Also, it is a little irritating to have to take it out and replace it everytime you want to refill the bottle.  You can fill over it I suppose, but it reduces the flow rate so that you have to fill much more carefully and slowly which reduces one of the advantages of having a large mouth bottle.  I also kind of wish that there was an easier way to access the lip of the bottle than having to unscrew and rescrew the top each time, but that is a general issue with the bottles, not this lid.  But overall, a very useful purchase

This is a great skateboard ramp for kids who are really into skateboarding. If space is an issue, this is a great product. It is very sturdy for any type of skateboarding tricks. I would recommend having an adult present at all times when folding the ramp because it is very heavy. The wheels on the side make it very portable. My boys are 13 and 11 and they LOVE it

I was overall very happy with the performance of this tent for the price aournd $100.  It recently survived well while being used for over a week of backpacking in Denali National Park in Alaska.  The  weight is slightly more than typical backpacking tents, but the price and features make up for that.  It survived over 40 mph sustained winds one night with no damage.  The two doors and size are decent for 6 foot people without being too cozy.  The vestibules are very handy for storing your boots.  On colder nights it did get a fair amount of condensation on the inside of the tent though.  Overall a good purchase.

After reviewing some of the other devices to hold the iPod Mini in place while exercising, selected the Armband Carrier. It more than adequately fills the bill of what I was looking for. Occassionally, you might have to adjust the tension on the armband to keep it from slipping down your arm, but it holds the iPod firmly in place. It can cause some chaffing if you wear a sleeveless shirt if you walk or run with the device. If you sweat a great deal while you exercise, I would advise removing the iPod from the holder after you complete your routine. Would recommend it to anyone who asks

This case was ordered to hold some medical equipment that must travel with me on my about two-weeks-per-month business travel.  The good part is that this case will probably survive falling into a black hole.  The bad part is that it takes up half my carry-on suitcase.  But that's what you pay to have protection for expensive equipment

We use these socks snowmobiling in -20F temperatures and they keep your toes from getting numb when you're are outdoors for a long stretch.  Note the amt of head from the batteries is very small, but it's enough to keep your toes from numbing out on the trails.

The don't get "hot", and they are not made to keep your feet warm inside.  The amount of heat they produce is not enought to notice in a heated home or office.

Battery life on high is about 10 hours - maybe 12 hours on low setting.

I have had my fare share of yoga mats and this one rates as one of the best. The thickness (1/8 inch) is just perfect - not too thick so it's easily portable but thick enough to provide adequate cushioning. What I really like about this mat is that it has the right amount of stickiness and grip, in a word, it is comfortable.

I bought this mat, because my gym recently began offering yoga classes, and the mats they supplied soon got pretty grody.  This mat is longer and thicker than the gym's version, looks a lot nicer, and has a good 'tacky' feel under my bare feet.  And it was cheaper than comparable mats at local stores.  It's easy to hand wash (and comes with instructions), so I can keep it clean.  Overall, it's a great yoga mat.

I was looking for a bike trainer, but did not want to spend $150 and up.  Took a chance on this one, after seeing it being sold by Nashbar and Performance.  It seems to be quite solidly constructed and holds the bike very steady and secure.  I got it set up in 5 minutes without any difficulty.  Only 3 "levels" of difficulty, but this does not seem to be much of an issue.  It is not too loud, but also not terribly quiet-- about as loud as our washing machine.  Overall, for the price (I paid $80), this trainer meets/exceeds my expectations

The first thing that I thought was "this is a lot of equipment for the money".  It comes well wrapped and is easy to assemble.  Took me about an hour.  It's relatively sturdy, although there is some minor movement of the frame when changing exercises (eg, the frame will move slightly forward when moving from leg lifts to dips).  Overall, I do not see how they make money selling it this inexpensively based on the good quality of this machine.

Keep in mind, that in order to use the chin up bar, there needs to be enough clearance from the top of the machine to the ceiling, as your chin will touch the top of the machine.  Most residential ceilings are about 8 feet

If you are trying to decide between a wood or foam yoga block, I can highly recommend the foam blocks with beveled edges because they are very comfortable. 

When you are pressing on the blocks, they are firm enough to withstand your body weight, but not overly firm so they make your hands hurt from the pressure. 

Blocks tend to encourage proper form because they allow you to slowly work into poses and provide the needed support when you can't reach the floor in a pose. The lightweight blocks are easy to move from side to side and they can work as an extension of your arm. 

There are many ways you can use these blocks and once I started to do the Yoga Step By step workouts/yoga practice sessions, I found I really did need to buy softer yoga blocks to try some of the more advanced positions.

Three things to consider in a yoga block: size, material, color.  This thing is purple = ugly.  The material is foam, and this block will still be around 1 million years after I die - for a more environmentally sound purchase try cork, for double the price, of course.  Finally, I like the size of this block, most blocks are 3x5x9, this one is 4x6x9 which means that its more stable

I bought this for myself to play with (I'm 35) and after all the presents were opened and toys, video games, and everything were forgotten (about 4 hours after Christmas), this was the ongoing favorite of the season.  Everybody, younger (down to 8) and older (to 45) had a blast with this thing after a couple minutes coaching. It's already on everybodys wish lists for upcoming birthdays and such.  This is a GREAT present for 11-18 boy. Fair warning though, there will be some good spills on the fairly short, steep learning curve - helmets, knee pads, blah, blah, are a must (and a video camera!

Got this for my 4 year old niece's birthday, she is really into Dora so she was happy with it.  The skootskate is simple to put together, but not necessary the most durable materials.  Then again, you get what you pay for. I got this on the Friday sale for ten bucks, along with some books so that there is no shipping charge.  My niece is happy, so can't complain much about that.

The Suunto bike pod is easy to install in a few minutes, and worked, as advertised, paired with the Suunto T3, Training Effects/Heart Rate monitor.  Unlike other wireless cycling computers used in the past, the Suunto bike pod does not require micro positioning on the bike and continues to send reliable signals to the Suunto T3, even in bad weather and over rough terrain. Although bike pod includes provisions for mounting the Suunto T3 on the handle bars, this configuration is not required for use.  The Suunto T3 is a wrist-worn training effects and heart rate monitor, and works fine when worn on either the left or right wrist, receiving wireless signals from the bike pod as well as the Suunto heart rate transmitter worn around the chest

I bought a flybar 800 a few months ago and its the coolest thing ever. You can jump super high on it, and the people that work for flybar are awesome. i emailed them when my ruuber tip broke, and they responded a few hours later and sent me a new one for free.

My three sons and I saw these pogos demonstrated at the Cleveland X Games a couple years ago.  We could not beleive what we saw.  This is unlike any pogo stick you have ever seen.  For the money, it's a tremendous value, and their customer service is the best I have come across.  They also make a high(er) octane version called the Flybar 1200 which supports larger riders.  For adults (yes, adults will love this thing!)or kids this is a "must have" this Christmas.  My youngest son can't wait for their next model (Flybar 400) due in '07 I believe...An absolute, 100%, thumbs-up!  Jim Woods, Akron, Ohi

I bought this bike for myself and I love it.  I got it for half the listed price.  It was originally intended as a starter to introduce myself back in to biking (at 30+yrs old) but I'm going to stick with it.  The other buyer with the bad experience must have gotten a bad bike.  The brakes are excellent and the bike itself, including shocks, are just as sturdy as my husband's expensive pro bike.  The 24inch is perfect for me, being barely five-foot-two; and doesn't seem too juvenile in stature or in color.  I highly recommend this bike

I bought a red GE Lantern a couple of years ago. I have used it for power outages, walking my dogs morning and night during the winter, and rarely, I've even used it for camping.

I haven't done any definitive studies but the battery life seems to be longer than the 16 hours GE states.  I find the light to be strong enough to read by.  During dog walks the lantern has all but been submerged in rain and it hasn't phased it.  And it's performance has not been affected by colder temperatures even down in the teens. Though I have to admit, neither the dogs, or I wanted to be out very long in weather that cold.

The workmanship is very nice.  I recently looked at Coleman lanterns and they have gone to a flimsy plastic top.  The GE lantern is built very sturdily but is light enough to carry in one hand and still control a leashed dog. 

The only downside I've found, and I don't consider this a big issue, if the lantern is knocked hard enough, say you slip and fall down a ravine in the rain, the batteries will slip out of place somewhat and the light will either dim or go out.  It is easy to fix, just transfer both dog leashes to one hand, turn the lantern upside down, unscrew the base enough so the batteries can be settled back where they belong and tighten the base back up.

I would definitely purchase another GE lantern.

The are pretty comfy and definitly help out your hands and wrists during workouts. Unfortunatly, the wear out pretty easily a the seams. I saw them cheaper at Hibbets after I ordered them from here. Oh well, only like a three dollar difference. I'll know next time when I get another pair in about two months

This is an excellent idea and greatly expands menu options while camping. You have to remember it is not a crock-pot though, the 6qt container is steel and not stoneware - I didn't. Therefore, a crock-pot dish that took 10hrs on low was done in 30min on low with this product, certainly this is not the product's fault but owner error. A very good product, highly recommended for campers and tailgaters

I'm currently in Iraq and I ordered this bike, although it took a while to get it (not uncommon in a package that is 90 percent medal) I was happy when finally I recieved it. I had a little trouble putting the brakes on and warped the alumimum screws that hold the brakes cables to the levers. After my small mishap I was on my way riding in 30 mins or less. I've had the bike for about three months or more and it has stood up to all sorts of terrain and weather. During the summer tempertures can reach 130 during the day and I had no issues with paint or the mechanics period. Now its the winter season and tempertures drop down to 30 and it rains often; still no major damage or issues other than a little rust on the four screws holding the handle bars in place. I've taken this bike threw rocks, dirt, asphalt, and plenty of sand. After a quick spray with the hose and wipe with a dry rag the bike is just as glossy and bold as the day I took it out of the box. Overall I am very pleased with this bike and plan to bring it back to the States with me when my tour is up

Living in Europe, my husband and I were dubious about ordering a bicycle for our daughter who lives in USA.  However, knowing the reputation of Amazon, we risked it.   Our final choice was the Women's Ranger by Schwinn.   It was assembled by a friend without any problems as the excellent manual was most comprehensive.   The bike is beautiful and we - and our daughter - are thrilled.   It is made of high quality components, yet is fairly light.   It is sturdy enough to handle the roughest city streets, which is where our daughter will be cycling.

The gear shift is smooth and effortless and the brakes excellent.

As a footnote, the first bike arrived with slight defects, was returned to Amazon who sent a replacement before even receiving the first bike back!   We were most impressed!   The second bike is perfect!    It looks so good too - quite important for women

 The wife and me each got a set and tried it out today. We were surprised everything was great quality and looked nice. The fins are great cut right thru the water. The snorkle is also great, kept water totaly out in waves and when diving. The mask was good/ok. You can't go wrong with this package.
  Wish I would have got the other US Divers kit with the little better mask and same fins for a few bucks more.

We are happy.

Bought this for my husband for Father's Day!  Delivered in no time! He loved it!  I let him do the registration etc. because he has more patience than I.

It works very well.  Bought the vice like attachment too so it could go in every golf cart we use including our own.  I LOVE IT. I have trouble judging distances and this is our co-toy now!

The battery went dead too soon. We called Sky Golf and they are sending a free one out posthaste. We even bought the $19.95 warranty for one year.  It's worth it!

I have used this unit twice and have been more impressed each time.

First time was a loaner from my favorite golf shop and the second was the unit that I just purchased. 

My reaction... WOW.  Great tool for golfers at all skill levels.  The information presented appears to be extremely accurate and is much more accurate than guessing or finding a marker and then interpolating distances.  I found the IntelliGreen feature extremely useful.  I was able to shoot at several greens unseen whereas before I would have laid up in a safe visible landing zone short of the green.  The target lists were consistent with the features I was concerned about on most holes.  If anything, I found the target list to contain too many items

I found registration and set up a bit tedious and would like to Sky Golf make it easier.  Be sure to read the installation instructions in the manual very closely.  Your internet browser MUST be set to allow cookies from Sky Golf.  Otherwise you may spend all day and never get set up or be able to download courses.

The variety of plans for course downloads is adequate, but I wish they would include at least a 1 year subscription to the basic "PAR" Sky Player course download plan with the purchase of the unit.

Others have complained about quality and construction.  I don't know what their standards are, but my unit seems well constructed and of very high quality material.

Bottom line, if you can afford it and you're looking for a great product to improve you knowledge of the golf courses you play... then this product is for you.

I've been doing yoga for 7 years.  I've gone through a couple of regular sticky mats by now (I don't like how they get stretchy after a couple of years), so I decided to buy something more durable.  I love the texture of this mat -- it's very solid feeling with a good bit of stick -- and it doesn't move around at all.  It has just the right amount of cushion to it, and I use it on a hard floor.  I also bought the Lumi towel (large size), also by Manduka, to put on the mat, since my hands and feet tend to sweat by the time I get to the middle of my routine, and this can make any mat slippery.  I didn't have any trouble with the coating on the mat -- it wore off after a little bit, and I used the towel until it did.  I also didn't agree with some of the other reviews saying it was too heavy.  It's a bit heavy, but not too much to carry around all over -- I made a carry handle from a yoga strap (looped over both ends of the rolled up mat) and throw it over my shoulder

Great mat. Provides good purchase, even when getting sweaty. It is a bit short, if you are above 6ft. (like me) to do Ashtanga, but is great for Hatha Yoga

A little caveat -- this review is actually for the exact same flooring system in the 1'x1' size tiles (which worked out better for me because they are a little more flexible in terms of configuration for a smaller space).  

That said, these floor mats are really great!  I wanted to create a home gym space for doing floor aerobics & step workouts as well as pilates, yoga, weighted workouts, etc.  These fit the bill absolutely perfectly!!!  They  are stiff enough that there's no danger of ankle instability because of a too-soft surface, but they are soft enough that when you do floor work, they provide excellent cushioning.  My knees used to kill me when I would do a runner's stretch, but now I actually go "ahhhh" as I'm doing them, which is great.  Not even a smidge of discomfort.  They are also really great for absorbing the jarring of high-impact activities.  Talk about an ankle, knee, and hip saver!  The ONLY discomfort I still notice and I really think it's just me) is during floorwork when I'm on my side to do leg lifts, I have some problems in the area of the greater trochanter (bony prominence at the top of the femur).  But I am very sensitive in that area due to running a marathon recently, so again, I really think it's just me.  Anyway, I just can't say enough good things about these mats -- I highly recommend them.  

Now -- to address the title of my review.....  My ONLY complaint about the mats -- and I'm echoing another recent reviewer on this -- is that when I first put them down, they slid all over the place on my hardwood floors.  Because they are not completely wall-to-wall in the configuration I had them, this was a problem.  I was able to solve the problem completely, though, by buying one of those sticky under-carpet anti-slip pads that you can get very inexpensively.  I found a yoga sticky mat placed underneath did the trick, as well.  But I would have had to put about 3 yoga sticky mats underneath to cover enough surface area to keep it from slipping.  

In short, if you have hardwood floors like me (I don't know how they would perform on carpet or other surface; you'd have to see another review to check on that), I highly recommend these mats without reservation -- provided you are willing to shell out a tiny bit of extra dough to get an anti-slip pad to put underneath.  Also, if you do, be sure to get one that covers the whole area of the mat (or very close to it).  Otherwise, if you come down on a part that's not protected during a lateral move, you may find yourself sliding across the room and losing your balance.  

A little expensive, but really worth the investment in my opinion.  Happy sweating to you (or whatever activities you plan to use the mats for).  :

These mats are easy to use, and pretty durable, but I find them to be too slippery.  Not enough friction.  A thin rubber surface would be much better

I ultimately purchased 4 of these bikes for my beach house.  They are very reasonably priced and provide a sturdy ride.  They look like a true beach cruiser and have fenders, a feature not often found on less expensive cruiser bikes. They are easy to assemble.  They were shipped quickly and arrived safe and sound.  The ride can be a bit stiff but for the price you cannot complain

These gloves are extremely high quality. They do a great job of protecting your hands, and for most exercises, they do help your grip. The have the best wrist support of any glove I've used to date. However, as mentioned: if you have small hands, the added padding/rubber in the gloves will decrease the circumference of your grip in general. This is a problem for exercises like deadlifts, chin ups, etc. Also, the material inside is a bit like felt. When your hands are sweaty, these gloves basically adhere to your hand on the inside and it usually takes me 1-2 minutes to get them off. They may just need to be broken in more, but I've used them for 3 weeks thus far.

I have 6 children.  4 couldn't ride bikes.  The scooters teach balance without worry about pedaling. The kids feel safer because they can hop off easier.  Now, 5 out of 6 of my children are riding bikes and the last probably will be soon.  Great toy

Purchased for a Christmas gift. The larger wheels and stronger construction was just what my son needed. He had the orignial A scooter for several years but is now a teen and was in need of a new razor with stronger construction. He was also wanting the wheely "kick" bar over the back wheel. Overall, the A3 gave him everything he needed to continue enjoying "the Razor." Kick stand would have been a nice addition to this model but no big sweat..can just be one more thing to break in my opinion.  Price on Amazon couldn't be beat. Price was by far the best from a host of on line sites I checked. Shipping was great deal and came quickly, within 3 or 4 days after ordering it just a week before Christmas! In the word of my son "Santa be very very good to me!

Perfect way to ensure you are drinking the minimum requirement of 8-8 oz. servings of water each day.  Fill it up in the morning and make sure it's empty by the time you go to bed at night! Very sturdy and best of all - NO plastic taste to your water!

We bought this stroller not only for jogging but also to use at places like Disneyland.  The swivel wheel makes this stroller the easiest thing to steer and our kids love it.  Our kids our three and one, both fit in the stroller comfortably.  The only draw back to the stroller is it does not have a cup holder for the parents

I like how this thing folds up nicely so after scooting around downtown (the kid, not me) I could fold it up when we enter grand central market without hitting anyone in the shins. As for age requirements, the manufacturer recommends 5 years of age. I say that's about right but get padding for every possible body part and make sure to teach her/him how to fall correctly...ie, not on unpadded body parts like your hands...And red works for boys and girls...so if you're thinking about the pink or blue one and for some reason it's double the price stick with this..

The scooter is fine. the post office lost the package, though. I called the company and they told me they would issue a refund only after so many days/weeks, and would not send a replacement unless I was willing to pay for it in advance. I opted to purchase another one through a different company that used UPS instead of USPS (more reliable shipping). Several days later the first scooter arrived, three weeks late. the cost to return it was high enough that it made more sense to just keep it. So, now I have two and only needed one. I realize USPS is at fault for the shipping, but a better action plan from the seller could have resolved this quicker. The scooter was a present for a birthday. I ordered in plenty of time to receive prior, but ended up with a very late present

Now, I have been playing tennis for 8 years and I must say, this is my favorite racket I have used. I have been using it for about two years or so and plan on using it for many more. It seems Head Liquidmetal rackets are gaining alot of popularity and I have seen more players using them within the last year or so. For me, the strings break roughly every 3 or 5 months. However, if you play at a less competitive level. They will break twice a year maybe. If you're just starting to play tennis, I don't think this would be a good racket to begin with, however if you play for a while and find yourself enjoying the sport and wish to play long term, this is the racket you need. Enjoy

I was actually surprised at how much this bike exceeded my expectations.  It's more than quiet, it's SILENT.  Very good resistance settings and even a nice variety of programs.  The bike is sturdy and easy to put together.  It's compact and doesn't take up a lot of room and the seat is also quite comfortable.  I couldn't be more happy with this purchase.  For those concerned about the shipping issues that were raised, my box had a dent or two, but the contents were fine and there were no missing parts

This is the best wind up light you're going to find. I advise everyone to get one for that unexpected event. Our power goes out about twice a winter from ice storms and this is one of my favorite lights and can be depended on along with the light from the freeplay plus. I got mine at the local Target store and I think it was only $35.00 and well worth it

some of the pros of buying the sniper rifle is...
it shoots crazy fast and is very accurate
I shot my uncle with it and it made him BLEED
none of the kids in my neighborhood want to fite against me any more
some of the cons of buying the sniper rifle is...
the safety can't be pushed to hard or it comes out
the handle starts getting kind of wobly and mine came off
the battery takes longer than it says to charge to work

please take my advice because I have had this gun for more than a year now and I know it front and back

First off, those of you calling it a "clip" should know that a clip is a nonremovable ammunition storage device attatched to or built into the gun itself. Please call it a magazine (actual name for it) And a full metal jacket isnt a full magazine of amunition its a bullet with a full metal casing like say 30-06 round. Second, dont complain about the scope because it is a decorative instrument. you can buy better scopes if your hardcore but if you are hardcore then get a real gun. this gun is good for shooting your little cousin from far away. Its a great gun dont get me wrong but its not meant to be used and abused like a ww2 garand or bar. It's plastic, it shoots things. I'm probably reinstating most of what everyone else said but thats just one more reassurance. So yeah get this gun if airsoft is a hobby for you. NOT A SPORT. I also suggest getting .20g bbs and maybe a speedloader or 2 cause mags are so expensive and this gun pours ammo like water. Have fun.

P.S. Though they may noth have the trigger finger ability, spring airsoft guns have a tendency to be more accurate and fire harder with heavier bb's. If you are playin with friends i suggest getting a $30 dollar rifle with 250-300 fps (shoots like 300-350

I am a plus size person, 6' tall with 69" hips and within the 400# weight limit.  This chair fits me perfectly and feels so sturdy!  I did a lot of research trying to find a chair that would accomodate me and my friends and this is the one!  I will be buying more!  The manufacturer of the chair states that ".... a 300 pound person can use this chair and it will withstand vigorous use. We work in conjunction with STR Labs to develop and administer destructive testing of our products. Our "reality check" is for a TRAVELCHAIR product to withstand twice the force exerted by the recommended weight limit in an "agressive" situation.

This has to be one the best Protein supplements in the market! And more importantly, the taste is just unbelievable! The Banana Creme and Vanilla flavors are the best. From a "Supplement Facts" perspective, each RTD bottle is packed with 32, yeah 32g of Protein, and only 14g of Carbohydrates! The Total fat is 16g which might be on the higher side, again 6g of which are in the form of MCT (Medium Chain Triglycerides) that are typically burned as energy and aren't stored as body fat! All in all, it works really good for me and if you are an active person like I am, you should prolly go get yourself some. (GNC also sells this for like 3 bucks

Being a bodybuilder, I hoist heavy weights all the time; a major stress especially when it comes to squats.  I ordered the boots when I realized I had shrunk to 5'10.5" from being 6'0.5".  I was thusly very happy when after approximately 5 weeks of hanging (5 times a week, 10-15 min intervals) that I am nearly back to my original height (6' 0.25").  I highly suggest this product as a supplement to good [emphasis on good] chiropractic care.  
To those who have/will order this product, don't be discouraged if it seems to hurt your back at first; that's totally normal because your back is trying to readjust while the discs [which cushion the vertebrate] start rehydrating.  Also, it will take some time to find the strap tightness that's right for your legs.  Generally, tighter on the top strap and looser on the bottom is a good combination.
p.s.  Hang from a real pull-up bar and make sure you have someone to spot you if you are not strong enough to pull yourself back up the bar to unlatch yourself.

This has been a great addition to my truck - a useful compass and outside thermometer without going to the expense of a navigation system (and without having to learn another techno-gadget).  My only complaint is that the display illumination could be a bit brighter.  I realize that a bright light on the dashboard could impair one's night vision, but a bit more contrast on the display would be helpful at night.

My unit was really easy to install ... no wires just suction cups for the main unit and no tools required for the temperature unit.  I drive mostly during the day so I like the unit, but those who do night driving cannot see the DIM LIGHT.
I had to remove unit in order to pass the VA state inspection.
In cold weather, the temp guage sometimes does not work.
Also, about the temp sensor ... If you place it too near the hot parts of the radiator it will not be accurate while driving in town or when stopped.  Behind the front license tag is great ... I put an old license tag under the new one and drilled holes to hold the temp sensor. That method works great.
I really like the automatic calibration feature

We had been looking for a light-weight backpacking tent with enough room for two. That seems simple enough, unless you've actually been inside of some of the "two-person" tents. Some of the expedition tents meet the size requirements, but are too heavy to be considered backpacking tents. We have just used this tent for the first time, and we are so far pleased. Plenty of room inside for two adults with large sleeping mats and sleeping bags, and a bit of gear. A large vesitibule on each side provides plenty of room for packs. I believe this will be a great warm-weather tent, with all of the mesh. The night we used it, it dropped below freezing. We woke to a ceiling (rainfly) covered in ice (on the inside). Didn't really expect that, with all of the ventilation, but as it was ice, it didn't drip on us. I'll chalk this experience up to extreme conditions until we use it in warmer weather. One thing that I don't like, although thus far it has not been an issue, is a seam running through the middle of the floor. It has been taped and sealed at the factory, but I just don't like the looks of it. I will seal it again before spring use, and edit this report, as we are sure to end up in a downpour here in south Texas. The tent is in fact lightweight and roomy, and so far, I am pleased. I will amend this report after having enountered weather with it

This really is a great tent.  Three people can sleep in it, but I've found it best for 2 people because then there's still room for all of your stuff (or a dog. lol).  I've used it for 3 years, and it never disappoints.  I've been in one good thunderstorm in it, and it did great and didn't leak at all.  It's very easy to set up, (especially when you arrive at your site after dark).  It vents really well, but best if you face the vented side into the wind.  Just don't forget to open out the little cross vent (with the "!") on the other side.  The inside pockets are really handy, and I think you can get a "net" that you can hang from above for more storage

This bike seat IS a HUGE pain to install on a bike. It took my husband and I working together about an hour to get it right and there were several points when we thought it wouldn't work...we persevered and got it on. It is fabulous to ride with our son. It is very sturdy. Our son is very large and rides in it just fine. The helmet slides on his head, but most helmets are tricky to get just right. Overall we have been very happy with this purchase

This item is a good value and comes packaged in a convienent container.  The beads can be reactivated by simply following the manufacturer's instructions and baking in an oven.  the 40 gram package is nice sized for small spaces/drawers, however larger spaces may require more than one.  Overall, this item is a nice value for those that do not want to buy the silica gel in a bulk package and deal with making your own container(s).  I would recommend for anyone keeping tools or other collectables where moisture is not wanted

I just bought the SpeedBelt 2, deciding that the 4 bottle belt would be more cumbersome for me. So far, the 2 bottle belt has worked well for me in the 5-10 mile run range. It fits 2 gels comfortably and 10 ozs of water in each bottle. For longer runs, I'd suggest the 4-bottle belt, but this one is great for the intermediate range. The belt fits comfortably and I didn't feel that it bounced around much at all. Recommended

I have been completely satisfied with Jansport backpacks.  They are very well made and I love the guarantee.  The straps are more comfortable than other backpacks purchased.  My 14 year old son has had one for three years, and it is still in great condition.  Previous cheaper backpacks have lasted a year or two at the most.  This model has lots of zipper pockets in different sizes for storing just about anything you'd want to put in a backpack.  Great product

I've had this backpack for about 5 months now, and I still have a great opinion of it. It holds many books and folders... It can also accomodate my Inspiron laptop with a 15.4'' screen. The backpack doesn't have an included laptop sleeve, so I found a solution by buying the Sumdex Padded Large Laptop sleeve, which isn't very expensive, but very protective and a perfect fit, and just putting the Laptop in the sleeve then putting the sleeve into my backpack. Even after doing so, I still had room for a couple of books. Keep in mind that this does make it a large backpack, slightly bulky, so if you aren't in need of something with such a high capacity, then this might not be the backpack for you.

The backpack doesn't have a lot of organization as far as dedicated slots for pencils, pens, etc... It just has a few smaller zippered openings. If you have a lot of stuff in them, you will be having to fumble around your things. I didn't find this too troublesome overall, though.

The backpack is comfortable, and seems to be holding up pretty well against all the weight of my nursing books, etc...

I am happy with my purchase, as I always have been with Jansport purchases

Hey,

I decided to review some things I didn't buy off Amazon, but I have owned for sometime that are really great items: the kind I would buy again for sure if they were lost. I would say lost or broken, but Jansport has lifetime warranties! If anything happens to your backpack, all you have to do is mail it to Jansport with a note of the problem, they will fix it for FREE and send it back to you. They will even send you a card while they have it telling you it misses you and will be back soon. Overall, these are such great products, you just have to get a Jansport if you're thinking of a backpack.

Also, I am in a review writing competition with a friend of mine and if this review is helpful, which I hope it really is, I would love to have your yes vote!

With Care, 
Sa

We pruchased this tent for our annual car camping trip in Northern MI, where weather is very unpredictable.  We've had other tents that took FOREVER to set up, but this one was super simple.  I think it too two of us less than 15 minutes to have it up and ready.  We loved the size of this tent - plenty of room for our air mattress and gear.  The air circulation was great, too.  Even in the heat of the day, we had a nice breeze keeping us cool, thanks to a miriad of windows.  When rain came during the night, we stayed dry, though I would recommend sealing the seams prior to using this tent.  Overall, we're really happy with this tent (especially for the price!), and plan to use it for several years

I just got this from Khol's. They had it on sale for $11.99. When I saw it, there were plenty on the shelves. I was kind of curious as to what they were because of its funny shape.  There was a try me sign on there. So in my boredom, while waiting for my ride, I read the directions on the back and actually tried it. It was kind of funny to read 'wind up for light'.

I'm glad I checked out the aisle. I've never seen anything so cool.

It's very simple to wind-up the flashlight. The ball has a special roller that allows you to pump easily. It's not difficult to follow the instructions. Anyone could do it. 

The lightbulb is LED so according to my internet research LED:
"LEDs have an extremely long life span, twice longer than the best fluorescent bulbs and twenty times longer than the best incandescent bulbs.
"

The design is actually very nice to the touch. It's padded with some nice rubber grip, so its not unpleasant to hold. It's not very heavy at all. It's about the size of a male's electric shaver.

I bought it at Khol's for more money than its listed here on Amazon. I got it today and I showed my younger siblings. They loved it, too.

Basically the light is powered by the mechanical motion of your hand. It's really simple to use and its a comfortable design. I plan on going back to get more tomorrow.)

2nd Suunto. 1st was a Vector bought in 2000 that I abused pretty good before having to get another (water seal was damaged and it took on water during a kayaking trip). Doubt I'll ever use the heart monitor in the mountains but it is excellent for training. Highly recommended

I after drooling over this watch for two years wishing I had one, I finally got one and have had my Advizor for two months now.  All I can say is that if I had known how cool this thing really was, I would have shelled out the $300 a long time ago. Each one of the features listed above does everything you could want. The Heart Rate Monitor has target zone settings, average workout heart rate, highest and lowest hear rate, and more. The Altimeter tells your rate of ascent, total vertical climb and stores all the data from recent workouts in memory. The coolest feature is that it will store your heart rate, altitude and rate of ascent/decent at intervals from 20 seconds to ten minutes so that after a workout you can scroll though and see how your heart rate was affected by altitude and acent rate. I got completely geeky with this information after one workout, and I typed it all into my computer so I could see what it looked like. The only drawback to the Advizor is that it gives you so much information, it would be great if you could download it directly to a computer for analysis. There is no PC link, so any analysis has to be done on the watch or typed in by hand. But other than that, this gizmo is perfect. No problems at all so far and I use the thing for two workouts a day.  I am a cross country ski racer and for a long time I had thought that this would be the perfect training aid for endurance athletes and now that I have tried it I know that it is

This review will focus on the specs since there is minimal information available unless you buy the bike.

First off, this is my second Mongoose.  I started out on a crappy low end Cruiser model, so anything even half a step up from that model is a vast improvement.  

The Theory weighs about 38 lbs and is actually light grey in color despite the image on this website.  I thought I was getting a white bike, and I'm a little ticked it's actually grey, but, whateva.

Assembly isn't too bad as long as you have half a clue as to what you're doing.  The documentation is adequate, but don't expect to be able to assemble this bike correctly if you haven't done it before.  The documentation will frustrate you.  But the average person can probably install the pedals and the saddle, and maybe even mount the handlbars correctly assuming the brakes don't arrive screwed up like mine did.  The front cable had to be relocated because when it was assembled at the plant, it was threaded immediately under the fork and the tire was rubbing against it so it had to be removed and resituated, which entailed messing with the front cable.  Simple enough, I suppose, but this assumes you know what you're doing.  

I couldn't install the front tire correctly because of the disc brake, and, wanting to be safe instead of stupid, I took the bike to an LBS and had them install it. It was then that I found out one of the disc pads was missing.  No problem.  I just went back home and found it in the box. Apparently it had become dislodged from the housing on the front tire during transit.  I didn't even know it was there because I haven't worked with disc pads before. It was a good thing I didn't toss the box right away otherwise I would have been SOL.  Just be advised, however, that if you are missing one or both disc pads and do toss out the box before you realize one of the pads is missing, depending on where you are, you may or may not be able to find replacement pads.  You may end up having to upgrade to a better brand disc brake.

Now onto the specs.  The front disc brake is Promax brand, DSK-400, which in the world of mtn biking, is the generic low end.  I had to do some digging around on the web to find the following site because you won't find a "[...]" website.  It wasn't really all that much more helpful and did not help me to understand disc brakes any better, but at least you'll have a better idea what to look for.  The documentation on the site have color images vs the black and white images that come enclosed with the bike.   Go here instead:  [...]

I wouldn't call the Promax disc brake crap, but, close enough.  Note: If you plan on doing any kind of semi-serious mtn biking, as in on a trail considered "intermediate" level, then upgrade the disc brakes.  And if you're planning a real mtn biking trip with rocks and logs and the whole nine, then the Theory can probably handle it, just don't expect miracles.

As to the gears, there are 21 Shimano flavored and they work flawlessly.  They're a pleasure to have because there isn't the usual slipping and dragging you see on lower end Mongoose mtn bikes.  The only problem I had was the upper gears don't seem to want to shift into any gear definitely unless you downshift say, to 2, then upshift to 3, for example, and so forth for the others.  If you want 6, then go to 5, then upshift and vice versa.  This may or may not be because the cogs need to be lubed.

As to the ride, the Theory is a dual-suspension bike and you can really feel the difference vs a hard-tail bike.  Wow.  Just riding on the street and going over speed bumps and rain gulleys is amazing.  You have very little to no shock at all because the suspension absorbs it.   

Overall, this bike is good bang for the buck, but I wouldn't pay over $300.00 tops for it.  If you're going to go that high, you can get something else with higher end parts.  Oh, one last thing.  If you value your reproductive organs, and don't want to find yourself numb from package to exit and/or sitting on a bag of frozen peas for a week after using the bike, then do yourself a favor and switch out the saddle.  The one that comes with the Theory is horrible.  Get a thicker padded, gel lined, split saddle instead.

When the product came I realized that it wasn't what I was looking for in a fanny pack but I was impressed with its rugged construction.  I needed a pack to walk around Disney World and thought the two water bottle holders would come in handy.  I like to freeze my store bought water bottles so that they stay cold all day.  The water bottles that come with this pack are double wide and have a wide top - meaning you can't wrap your lips around it like a store bought bottle. Plus you have to wash and refill them as opposed to just buying another Dasani.  Unfortunately, you can't use the water bottle holder for anything much narrower than the included bottles because there is just a single strap across the bottom preventing their bottle from falling through but that wouldn't stop a regular 16 oz. job from slipping passed.  So I'm returning mine, but if your looking for non breakable, wide mouthed water bottles, in a rugged waistpack then this is for you.   PS for some reason the blue one is cheaper, at least when I bought it

The Bowflex Series 7 Treadmill is as good as advertised.  It was easy to assemble and the instructions were thorough.  It is also very easy to program and operate.  No time is wasted figuring out the instruction manual.  I also love the quietness of the motor.  
Because the machine is sturdy you will need some help moving it into place.  Go ahead and get it...

No, this gun isn't very powerful - but THAT'S THE POINT. This gun is perfect for a young kid to learn about guns.  Slow enough you can actually see the BB, accurate enough to hit a target routinely at around 20 to 25 feet

Well, I originally ordered the Black UTG Black Sniper Rifle, but was out of stock at Air-Splat. Well, I could have waited 3-4 weeks or get the Green UTG OD Green Sniper Rifle that I had been thinking about ahead of time. So I sent a reply e-mail and they sent this rifle about 3 days later. The screws, you get some screws, now on the newer versions, the long screw that is supposed to go in the port behind the trigger, is not the long screw. You put in a short screw, well at least for me. I had tried to figure out what was wrong, finally decided to call them and they told me what to do.
Now to the Gun- Excelent. Definently get a scope if you plan on being a sniper. Also, have your friends wear good goggles and no bear skin. It will either bleed or nice a welt, and if thats cool with you, than by all means dont tell them untill its to late. The gun itself should only be used with .20g and up. Anything less will ruin the gun. With .20g you can easily punch through a unopened can of soda. The gun in a airsoft battle is a bit mixed. Personally, I stay back and take head shots at the other team's leaders and medics. With the bolt-action that you use, you can decide when you are going to relode. Also, you should also get alot of white .20g. With white .20g, you can adjust where you fire and get even more accurate shots. 
Pros:
Very accurate
Very painful (could be con, depends on how you look at it)
Weighted well
Very intimidating looking 

Cons:
A bit heavy for long games (But you should be moving anyways now should you?)
If you dont sight your scope (or dont even get one) there are no aiming sights, it would be a bit wasy to miss

I just ordered this beauty.  The price is right, the price will probably be more expensive in a few months.  The full tang is very sturdy.  The handle is usually a lil thin (flat) on these type of blades.  

I was also looking at the Galaxy Viper twin blades in silver (also comes in black) but there's no pic of the shealth.  It just says it's nylon shealth.  It holds the 2 blades.  This wasn't exactly what I was looking for so I chose the Ronin.  

BTW, I got the last 1 from a seller.  They were out of stock last time I checked.

It was just what I wanted--a relatively stress-free low-impact workout that you can do while zoning out in front of the tv. Takes about 30 minutes to put together. It's quiet, stowable, and fun. My ten-year-old likes it, too. I don't have any problems keeping my feet in the straps as long as I'm wearing shoes, so maybe the people who were complaining about that issue hadn't been wearing shoes. A really nice little machine, and what a great price

after a several uses, the anti-fog starts to fail... 

at the beginning when it is band new, it works great! Clear and sharp.

I always wash it with water and hand soap after swimming to clean up the clorine ...  still, the anti fog inner layer wears out quickly.

The good thing is that it doesn't leak... that's the important part.

Over all, it's still a great product compare to other models.  If not because of the poor anti-fog thing, I would have give it a 5 stars rating

I bought these [clear color version] as a gift for a young adult male who is an avid indoor swimmer.  According to the gift recipient, "they're excellent," they really don't leak or fog up.  He was thrilled to finally find a pair of goggles that didn't get any water in his eyes. (but please note: he doesn't swim for more than one half-hour at a time, so I can't vouch for whether they stay unfogged after longer periods of continuous pool activity.) He also said that the fit is very good, and the choices of nose bridge make these goggles accessible to most face types.  For the price, these are an excellent bargain

Waterproof cases are so expensive!  (and heavy) We aren't divers, but spend lots of time outdoors in conditions hostile to electronics, skiing, hiking, fishing, at the beach, etc.  In addition to water, dirty hands, sand, and dust are hazards.

This Aquapac performs as described, kept the camera (Canon A95) safe and dry despite immersion in swimming pool etc.  The picture quality was unaffected, but flash doesn't work well due to internal reflections.

Well worth the price

I recently returned from almost 3 weeks of treking around Italy. I'm not a runner (or a walker, or even mildly aerobic) and I have baby-tender feet, so I was very concerned about blistering. On the advice of some runner-friends, I bought BodyGlide and coated my feet with it EVERY DAY before I put on my socks and shoes. My feet were tired and achy every night, but NO BLISTERS!! This is an amazing testament to the power of BodyGlide because sometimes I can have blisters wearing normal shoes during a normal, low activity work-day, and I was walking for hours at a time over bricks, cobblestones, you-name-it. If you are going to be traveling where you will be walking more than usual or on a differnt terrain then you are used to, buy a big, ol stick of Bodyglide and coat your feet every day

Me and a friend bought 2 of these.  They look really cool.  However they are not sharp at all (hence only 4 stars).  For $15 they are really good value though.  The hilt is plastic and the blade is a little thin.  Other than that they are quite good.

I use these for MMA type workout on bags& blocking pads, and they have worked well. They give good protection even when hitting hard. I have not had the problem with dye fading that I noticed with some other gloves. Overall I would reccomend, about the same or less than other gloves from everlast, century, ect and just as good quality.FYI There are a lot of visible seams where the pads "pockets" are attached (especially on the fingers) that you can't see well in the picture advertised. I do't think this is a big deal as many bag gloves have this, I wouldn't use them to spar as these would tend to cut. (most people would use "fighting gloves" to spar anyway, but just trying to be helpful !!

You want to loose that gut, build muscles everywhere and become a lethal adversary all at the same time? Then get a punching bag and pair of gloves. To be honest the hardest part is getting the bag to stay on the hook without pulling out your ceiling every few days. You need to consult a hardware store for the right bolt fitting. Getting this right is half the battle. When you have finally managed to find the right bolt type for your ceiling then you are on your way to becoming somebody else! 10 minutes a day will make you a mean lean machine within two months, guaranteed. Start by looking for the boxing posture on the internet. Take up this basic stance and learn to throw punches while protecting your face with the other glove. Tuck that chin in. You will cut your knuckles, even with gloves on, but these wounds will heal and soon you will find your hands hardening up with each blow. Move around the bag and make those strikes count each time. Feel the punch and try to avoid awkward possible wrist breaking miss-strikes that you don't want to make. Within a few days you will find yourself building up a quicker pace. Everyday your arms will be firmer and your muscles bigger. Your hands will become stronger. Take off the gloves at the end of the punching workout and try chopping the bag with the base of the hand, directly under the thumb with the thumb stretched out and the elbow bent. Strike downwards and sideways with the palm facing down, never up. Harden up those chop areas of the hands. Now when you have built up some nice chopping combos without gloves and boxing combos with gloves, it is time to throw in some elbow blows. Move that hand in towards your chest and strike just above the elbow with each arm. Twist that body and harden up those areas on both arms. Start striking with elbows, gloves or chops in whatever order you want. Build up a rhythm to your workout and soon you will be throwing twenty move combos at the bag. You will stun yourself. Now the next step is either to take up a proper boxing course for correction or go study some manuals on Close Quarter Combat. It beats most of the far east martial arts by using some brute force quick knockdown strategies. Try "Get Tough" by W. E. Fairbairn for starters. Rubber knives are also good. Learn the strategy in "Kill or Get Killed" by Rex Applegate. Keep up with the sport boxing and learn these powerful World War II Trench Warfare Close Quarter Combat manoeuvres for self defence. And it all starts right here with the bag. Bag owners simply have the power

I too recieved this bag in a box semi-beaten up, but then again an 80 pound item in a lightweight cardboard box is bound to cause a little box damage. And no there was no interior protective bag, and my chain pack was tied with pink ribbon. 
   Now to the bag itself... The toughest, most well filled, and economical bags I have ever seen. I use light bag gloves and with the amount of filling and it's density I can punch for hours (If I had the stamina :) ), without getting the sore knuckles or the wrist pain that I used to get from denser packed bags. Plus it's an Everlast!!! This is a must buy for anyone who is looking for a heavy bag. Good luck and TRAIN HARD!!

Here's the deal with this item: it's fine for little girls (and I suppose, little boys that are inclined to dance) who haven't been exposed to a better dance game.  I got this for Christmas for my 5 year old daughter; she takes dance, likes dancing, has never had or known about another 'Dance Dance Revolution' game, and she LOVES IT.  It's a big hit; she's jumping all over the place, adds up her score at the end of each song, and it's been a great, cheap gift, with exercise to boot.

No, it's not sophisticated.  Older kids or teens (not to mention adults) would grimace in pain over the ancient graphics and lousy sound.  For them, get one that goes in their PlayStation or whatever.  

However, many 5 year old girls don't have a PlayStation, or need one.  This is perfect for them.  For $[...] and shipping, it worked out great for a little kid.  For a teen, it's $[...] wasted.  That's the difference

I use my inversion table two or three times a day for short intervals of a few minutes each whenever my lower back starts
to hurt or tighten up. Shorter and less intensive periods of 
use achieve better results that longer and fewer periods of
use. You don't have to change clothes to use the inversion
table; you simply get on it, wearing a suit, blue jeans or pajamas. You're not going to break a sweat...you're going to
stretch your back muscles and spinal cord, which doesn't take
any physical exertion. You should wear shoes to help you hang
upside down on the inverstion table without your feet slipping
out of the stirrups I highly recommend it for people suffering
from back fatigue and back pain. I no longer need to take any expensive medication to alleviate back pain or fatigue

I bought this machine because of the low price, and I was skeptical whether it would be worthwhile. However, I was very pleasantly surprised. It is a great machine, especially for beginners who want upper body workouts. If you're a serious athlete, or if you want leg exercises, this may not be the best machine for you. For me, it is working out great, and I have purchased other machines to give me the leg exercises I want. At first, I was dismayed by the fact that there were over 100 parts to assemble, but they went together very quickly and easily, and all the tools are included. Be advised that this is only for users weighing up to 120 kilograms, or 264 pounds. Great product

The gym is very easy to assemble, took me about 45 minutes on my own.  The book supplies several different workouts, hitting every major muscle group, and you get good resistance in every workout. You won't get great range of motion on all the workouts, there may be times when you'll need to lean back or put yourself in a different position in order to get a full stretch, but those are minor adjustments you'd probably have to make on any other type of equipment.  The gym itself is light, easy to move around the house, and doesn't take up much space. It may be too light, and not sturdy enough in some instances, and you will need to stand on the frame in the stand-up workouts. 
The price is outstanding, at 180 dollars. You're not going to find a better deal than this, and the workout is very comparable to the far more expensive Bowflex

My 9 month old loves this toy.  Before he got the hang of pushing the lever down to spin the balls, he would roll it on the floor and    crawl after it. It keeps him entertained and he keeps coming back to it. Also, there are no loose parts or pieces to lose, which I appreciate.  Great toy

A friend who is a successful competition mountain bike rider asked me to weigh the Blackburn Airfix after I bought it. He has had many occasions where his chain has broken, or his tires have punctured, so he wanted to compare the weight of the Blackburn versus the weight of all the individual tools he carried when he rides. The Airfix weighed in at about 245 grams - about 8 ounces - and his tools, including inflator, tire levers, hex wrenches and chain tool (all included in the airfix) tipped the scales at 337 grams - about 11 ounces. I suppose that a multitool may not be as convenient to use as individual tools, but for handiness, this seems hard to beat. The Blackburn lifetime/no-questions-asked guarantee is also very attractive.
So while I have yet had to put this tool into action with either my Trek 2200zr or my Trek 6000, in a world where every ounce of weight is a heavy concern, pardon the pun, I imagine I have made a wise purchase

I really like this bike. It's great.  The only complaint I have is with Amazon.Com Customer Service.  The bike came partly assembled.  You really should tell customers exactly what they will have to assemble.  I put the seat and pedals on.  The "quick release" for the front tire was missing from the box.  I called customer service and they could not send me one.  She said I would have to send the bike back and get a new one.  She couldn't even give me the number of the mfg.  I was so mad.  I didn't want to send the bike back that was too much trouble.  I took it to a bike dealer and he put the front wheel on.

I really like this bike. It feels like a bike from the '50s but with all the modern technology. The look is great and draws a lot of attention. It is somewhat simple to complete the bike since it arrives mostly put together but the assembly instructions are the worst I have ever seen with any product. I basically got no clue from the instructions on how to finish off the bike, it is hard to believe how poorly they are written. I was beginning to believe they sent me the wrong directions. After I got it together through trial and error the brakes and the shifter were way out of whack and I had to spend $30 at a local bike shop to get these items adjusted; the instructions for making the adjustment did not work. The guys at the bike shop took two attempts to get it right (two trips for me) and they were wondering why it was so difficult to adjust. After all that was done I love the bike and it rides nicely and when properly adjusted, shifts and brakes very nicely. The ride is comfortable and I love the seat and location of the handlebars. I would recommend the bike for all the fun and looks it has but be prepared for some hassle to get it right unless you are one of the lucky ones who gets one that is adjusted correctly out of the box. My suggestion is for the manufacture of this bike to fire the idiot who wrote the assembly instructions and hire someone with some writing skills. I also do not understand why the brakes and shifter were so far out of adjustment; did no one test the bike before they boxed it up

The Pros are this product has alot of functionality for the price. The odometer and heart rate functions were very accurate. The set-up and operations get easier with use (first few times you will need to refer to the manual). The manual is well written and thorough. The cons are the altimeter which is far from accurate

I just received the Blackburn Delphi 6.0 earlier this week, and I've already put it through a few rides.  I'm upgrading from a Cateye Astrale 8 that I've had for a long time.  I've started training with a heart rate monitor more seriously lately, and I thought having a single integrated unit to handle both features would be great.  I almost bought the Delphi 5.0 a while ago, but decided to hold out for the 6.0 to get the nifty altimeter features.

Here are my impressions about my new computer, good and bad...

Pros:

- The mounting bracket system is very clever, and seems better that the Cateye bracket I was used to.  Changeble soft platic shims line the bracket clamp, changing the fit for different handlebar diameters.  3 different thicknesses are included, which chould accomodate everything from skinny aerobar computer mounts to oversized road handlebars.

- The altimeter function is great.  The altitude measurement is solid and seems very accurate.  The percent grade reading acts sensibly, even though it lags a little (this is explained in the manual).  The distance climbed at the end of a ride agrees very well with topographic software, and works far better than the GPS-based solution I had been using.

- The Lap feature is great for capturing statistical snapshots of particular segments of your ride.  Had a big hill on your route, and want to know how much you climbed and how fast you averaged up the grade?  The Delphi makes it really easy to see those sections taken out of the whole.  Up to 20 laps can be recorded.  I think of them less as "laps" and more as "intervals".

- The backlight feature is very cool.  I've always just done without computer info at night before...but this way, I don't have to.  I'm sure it kills batteries, but it's nice to have.

Cons:

- The average speed algorithm seems a little flaky.  It seems to read ay least 0.1 mph slower than one would get by simply dividing distance by ride time.  My Cateye always agreed well with the calculated value, but the way the Delphi is figuring the average must be different.  This is liveable, and seems to be less of a problem on routes without a lot of stopping.

- The max heart rate reading can get ruined by frequent "spikes", so that the real Max HR is unknown.  Finishing a ride, it's possible that the max HR will show something unrealistic like 235, probably due to a signal glitch or some interference.  Then, you have no way of knowing what the true value is.  These spikes don't affect the average, however.  I should mention that I've seen this behavior on both of the standalone HRMs I've had before...so it's not unique to the Delphi.

- The cadendce sensor was hard to mount so that the magnet was close enough to the sensor.  I had to put the magnet very close to the end of the crank, because the crank arm is close enough to the chainstay at that point.  But mounted there, the magnet covers the back side of the pedal spindle.  If you have pedals which require a hexkey from the back side to remove, that could be a problem.  They could have remedied that by making the cadence magnet a little thicker.  For comparison, my Cateye crank magnet was mounted in the middle of the arm with no problem.

- The wire from the cadence-enabled bracket to the cadence sensor is very long.  This may be good for putting it out on aerobars or something, and I admit that too long is better than too short.  But I have a foot or more of extra cable to try to hide around my shifter cable housings, and it's hard to tuck that slack away.  And I have a large bike frame with plenty of tube real estate to spare.

- Unlike my standalone HRMs, the Delphi doesn't calculate calories used.  Not that those numbers are ever accurate anyway, but it would be nice for ride-to-ride comparison.

General Thoughts

Overall, I think it's a great computer.  The negatives above all are really minor issues, and I haven't found a computer yet that offers as much for such a reasonable price.  There's a lot more to tell than I can include in a review like this.  I'm just trying to hit the big highlights (and lowlights).  But definitely, no regrets on this end for buying it.

Love the trike--it is so cute.  My 2 yr old got it for his birthday and loves it.  The instructions to put it together were not very good, but it's a trike, so it wasn't that hard to figure out.  I would recommend this trike to any "Cars" fan!

I have 20 mo. old twin boys. I was given 2 different tricycles and each of my boys only wanted to ride the Disney McQueen trike so I had to purchace another one. This trike has two different sitting positions, has a wide wheel base for stability, and sits lower to the ground. My boys still can't use the pedels but love to use the trike as a ride on toy - It's a great trike for younger toddlers who want to ride early!

I just ordered a pair of these for my son, since my daughter is so pleased with them.  The wheel base is wide enough that beginners can get their balance quickly.  The wheels roll very smoothly.  The velcro attachment at the top provides ankle support, and is easier to adjust than just laces.  A fun outdoor activity!

I received my fitness bands shortly after placing my order.  At first, I was confused, because I was expecting a box and instead it was a mailer envelope, but I couldn't be more pleased with the product.  For just a couple of bucks, I am able to find different ways to challenge the muscle groups in my upper body.  Also, I can take it absolutely anywhere; one could fit in my pocket.


Here is the breakdown of the different colors and resistance which I've taken from the merchant's website.


Color	        Resistance
Red X-Light	3.3 lbs.
Orange Light	4.5 lbs.
Yellow Lt./Med.	6 lbs.
Green Medium	8 lbs.
Blue Med./Hvy.	10 lbs.
Indigo Heavy	15 lbs.
Violet X-Hvy.	20 lbs.


If you can sympathize with any of the following scenarios, this product is something I would recommend for you (Well, I'd recommend it for anyone, but these are the clients who have been searching for an answer):

1. You live in a tiny apartment and/or don't have a lot of a lot of storage space.  You need something that you can tuck behind your DVDs when it's not being used.

2. You don't have the means to pay for weights or weight-training equipment.

3. You can't afford to go to the gym, or are intimidated about going because everyone there is always so friggin' buff.


Do not purchase if you are allergic to latex.  It is only 90% free of soluable allergens, so if you are allergic, don't buy it.  This information is specifically listed in the product description so ignore the poor review by the illiterate complainer.


Other than that, enjoy the product and happy toning

I got this as a gift and just love it.  You wouldn't believe how difficult it is to balance on it without using your legs.  It's fun and you can just use it while you're watching TV.  How could that be wrong

This count up/down timer is exactly what I was looking for. No bells, no whistles -- just timings up and down. It's small and light, and can be clipped or held. It even has a magnet for attaching to metal surfaces. I only wish it had a shut-off switch so that it doesn't start counting (and beeping) if it's accidentally brushed

This is the same system released 4+ years ago.(This is the Fanny Lifter-not the Box and not the Transfirmer-the wider steps.)  

I was very out of shape-couldn't make it up stairs without being out of breath.  It was very tough starting up...I couldn't make it through a whole workout until almost the 10th workout.  I went from a size 16 to a size 6.  Because of this system I have fallen in love with exercise and feeling/looking great!

Allie, Lisa and Jen are great leads

I just love this workout, it really gets you sweating. It's a great workout for beginners as well, not too fast or complicated. I just started working out with The Firm System, and plan to use it to get back into shape. You can always purchase more DVD's to keep you motivated. I recommend this product to anyone who want to get into or stay in shape.

I like this for both the biking and running/walking. Easy to set up the pedometer, a little harder for the bike. There's a long cord. The front also scratched when I removed the plastic covering making it harder to read on the right side. It's working great though and I'm happy with the product

I have this for a month now. It has two pices joined by rubber which reduces the shock. In addition you might want to attach that rubber shock absorber which you can get under $5 in a sports store.

As a chef in a hot DC kitchen, I have tried all manner of powder and cream with the hope of eliminating or decreasing chafing.  At one point, I even devised a kind of "rosin bag" of cornstarch suspended on a string...

THIS STUFF WORKS FOR ME.  And if it works for me, in the hours of blistering heat and hot sweat... it will work for you

This product is phenomenal.  It reduces if not eliminates chaffing when applied properly.  It worked under my wetsuit.  It works under your arms and around your neck during open water swimming.  It works between your thighs or on your chest when running.  It may even prevent blistering on your toes while running, but I can't directly confirm that.  I'd recommend reapplying every four hours

Body Max is a very tough DVD.  I didn't find the step choreography too difficult to learn, but some of the combos were a bit quick and advanced.  I do recommend watching the cardio before attempting, or you'll be rewinding quite a bit like I did.  Cathe's cuing is great, especially while teaching the combo.

The complete workout is long and tough, but completely worth it.  If you don't have enough time, there are several premixes that have shorter lengths.  The premixes may be shorter, but they're no less intense

This DVD is tough... but don't be scared. Cathe does a great job with the premixes and you can pick shorter versions of the workout. I love the music on this DVD.... It's so much fun... it makes me want to keep jumping!!! The upper body routine is about 20 minutes long. It's efficient and straight to the point.

I've never seen results as quickly before... Cathe will definitely delivery results!!!

I've owned a Gust Buster for over 5 years now and it works great.  I've had it out in the early winds of a hurricane and it worked exactly as it was intended.  I like the big size because it keeps the rain away from more of me than the smaller ones do.  Mine isn't automatic, so maybe that's a problem, but every automatic umbrella I've ever owned eventually stopped working and had to be opened by hand

This is a great cot.  It is low profile, and made of strong materials.  I was worried about the wire legs, but they are very, very strong.  So strong that it takes some muscle to get them into their holes in the frame.  This might be a drawback for someone who is weak in the arms.  It folds up easy and is very portable.  Also, I have a smaller frame, and although this cot is perfect for me, a larger frame person might want to consider a wider version for comfort in the shoulder area.  You won't be disappointed in this one for the money

  I had seen this table at an outdoor concert and have been looking for some time to find it.  Just recently I saw one being used at a resort while we were on vacation.
 It is easy to set up and very stable.  We will use it for  picnics as well as an additional table on our deck.  The carry bag is another plus.  
No more bending over to serve food from the top of the cooler.

This is a great light, perfect for a "be seen" and backup light in addition to a stronger source.  The plastic handlebar mount failed on mine the first time out, apparently cracking from vibration fatigue.  The customer support from Princeton was terrific, though, and they sent a replacement mount (I contacted them on Friday and had the part Monday).  I may try to rig a velcro strap through the clip and attach that directly around the bar instead of using the supplied part

And the attached rainfly came in handy once as well.  It comes with a bunch of extra attached straps to secure all the extras (tent rods, sleeping pad, rope, etc...)

I had a similar experience as did others with the packaging of this product.  The box was literally falling apart when it arrived.  Luckily no parts were damaged.  On the plus side, the package arrived very quickly.

The bench has lots features for the price.  It was not difficult to assemble.  It folds up very nicely as advertised.  It is sturdy and easy to adjust.  This is a very good value

I purchased this bench about a year ago. I received it in 4 business days which I thought was really good. It took me about 45 minutes to put it together, there is alot of nuts and bolts, but once I finished assembly it has been a good machine, and I am still using it to do my weight lifting routines twice a week, it offers alot of different exercises, what I really love about it is the lat tower which alot of benches do not have until you get into the $300-$400.00 dollar range, which I was not willing to spend that much at the time. For the price of 129 bucks and the options you get, just can beat it. I am very happy with this machine. This machine is made by impex fitness and I definitely plan on upgrading to another impex when Im ready. Chris- V

My boy loves his drinking funtainer!  It has never spilled on his lunch box even though I have put it in different positions including upside down!  It it great because we can take it on a car ride and it will NOT spill all over the car if he drops it and it will keep his milk cold and even warm chocolate hot!  The straw that pops up when you open the lid is a plus and I have not had to replace it and the year is almost over!!  Very durable.  I love it and I'm planning to buy more!  It is well worth the money... and I bought it for $15.00!!

Recently we had a chance to use a Bongo Board about 40 years old. It was all wood with quite a large drum. The one we just purchased for my 8 year old daughter is great for many reasons. It is so portable that it has become a take it anywhere with you activity. The drum has an elastic cord so that it does not completely detach from the board when balance is lost, and balance is frequently lost. Finally we have had her friends try it and from initial angst to quickly getting the hang it has become a great confidence builder for them. Great investment for year round fun

I bought this stroller to replace my Combi-Ithru, but found that I needed to keep it.  Although this Schwinn stroller has proven to live up to its reviews has one slight draw back.  The recline position is a bit to far back for "mall strolling" making it a bit uncomfortable for the baby. Aside from that, the schwinn handles tough terrain like a Mercedes Benz or Cadillac.  Its great! Baby loves the outdoors and the comfort of this stroller.  It has ample room and keeps her protected from the elements.  It steers like a dream! Grandma loves the fact that it turns on a dime.  No extra effort needed. The big wheels and shock absorbers make it a smooth ride too for the sleeping baby.  My daughter is 13 months old, 24lbs and 32 inches tall and still has plenty of roomto grow into.  The stroller has great storage space below and the handle is height adjustable.  The only thing I don't really like is the upmost recline position is a bit to far back and seems uncomfortable for baby, the reason why I kept my Combi I-thru. Aside from that, I recommend it to anyone taking long walks in multiple types of terrain! This one can handle it all.  Happy Strolling.

The only thing that I don't like is that the seat cannot recline or can be made straighter. My husband tried to work something out, but the thing is that the manufacturer haven't thought about it

I just switched from a Suunto T6 to a T4 and this PC pod works seemless between the watch and PC. It is about 2x a paper clip and with the USB connection it is easy to carry.
Although a little pricy from the competition, if you want a system to track your running and easily monitor it the T4, Foot Pod and PC Pod work very well.
Down side is the software which does not support MAC, come on Suunto

 I am a dedicated martial artist that has been frustrated in my attempts to attain greater flexibility. Despite my previous instructor's claim that these types of machines are a waste of time & money, I decided to investigate the potential effectiveness of the "Versaflex". Based on this investigation, I purchased this machine & in the very short amount of time that I have used it, I am really happy. For me it makes stretching very relaxing & comfortable. I am very impressed!

I've tried lots of goggles, These are my favorite.  I didn't like the sponge goggles because the sponge was leaky and fell apart quickly.  And I remember the days when the one-piece goggles were popular but those never fit me very well.  These are adjustable: strap and comes with three nose pieces so you can get a custom fit.  And it's comfortable like the one-piece goggles and has a no-snag silicone strap.

This is exactly what I was looking for.  I had a very similar roller at my gym (Club One) and loved it, but left the gym a while ago.

A previous reviewer states that this product might be useless without the weight attachment.  Don't worry, it comes with it, and it works perfectly.  I interchange standard-sized weights all the time... have tested with up to 30lbs (30lbs is KILLER on your wrists, and I'm a fairly strong man)

If you want a gym-quality wrist roller, BUY THIS NOW

I am very happy with this product. It's made of the best material for speed and the timer beeps if you set it. 

I had initially rated this product with 1 star because it was twisting up so much that it became too short to jump over. But my brother fiddled with it and discovered that (unlike the rope in the picture) there should be a gap of the plastic rope so that it's not right up against the handle. So now I would give this product a 4 star rating because the manual should have mentioned it (and the sellers should have known that).

Great if you are serious with your kickboxing or any other martial art pad drills or sparring even!   Wrap easily and securely - nice and snug - real leather - soft but good padding and supports inside. Great wrist and fist supports upon impact!  I'd buy them again.. Need more color choices now.. :

On the advice of my chiropractor, I decided to buy an inversion table, but didn't want to spend a lot of money because I feared it would be yet another piece of equipment that would end up collecting dust in my spare room, along with my rowing machine and exercise bike.  So I purchased this Calm system because it was inexpensive and I figured I could sell it or send it back if I ended up not using it.

Well, so far I and my spouse have found it to be very good for relieving back pain, and best of all you don't have to spend a lot of time on the machine.  About 3 or 4 minutes a couple of times a day is all it takes to relieve lower back spasms and stretch out the spine.

Also, the machine is quite light weight and easily folds to shove in a closet or behind a wall unit.  Overall, I am pleasantly surprised and would recommend this system.  There is no need to spend a lot of money in order to experience the benefits of inversion therapy

Our very busy toddler (17 months old) is having a good time with this scooter.  It is very well made especially for the reasonable price.  The wheels do not scratch our wood floors, unlike some of her other toys.  She is our third and we have had our fair share of similar toys.  This one is one of the better ones.  The only down side is that it could be a little lower to the ground.  She is above average height and can just reach the floor well enough to push with her feet.  Our older girls were petitie and this would have been too big for them at the recommended age of 18 months.  Once they are in their twos, our girls have preferred trikes, so I'm also not sure how long this will last as a 'favorite', but it can definately be 'handed -down' or given to friends as it is going to last for years

We purchased the Razor Scuttle Bug Trike for our two year old daughter and she absolutely loves it!  She spends hours each day zipping around on it, and it is sturdy and lightweight. My only suggestion/complaint is that it is not adjustable in height.  She is a bit tall for her age, and it would be great if the legs extended a few inches. Would likely fit best for children ages 18 months - 2 1/2 years and under 35" tall.
Item comes pre-assembled and folds up flat.  Highly recommended

I struggled with the decision to buy this trike, thinking it seemed kind of cheap and plastic compared to the metal trikes of my youth. However, I ended up getting one for my 3 year old, and am going to order another for when my 1 year old is old enough. Whoever invented the rear handle steering mechanism is a genius, and me and my back thank them. I no longer live in fear of "daddy push me," since pushing doesn't require bending over to that terrible "pushing a tricycle" stance. The trike itself is lightweight and easy to maneuver. It has a low center of gravity and doesn't feel quite as tipsy as some. I recommend it

The Power Blocks are great if you don't have a lot of space to keep a full set of dumbells.  Changing weight is very easy and you can go change weight in 5 pound increments.  In addition to the 45 pound set, you can get an upgrade to increase the weight of each to 60 pounds (for around $150)

We just got this bike for my 4 1/2 year old.  It is a very sturdy bike that is easy for him to ride.  He is 45 inches tall and has about 1.5 inches clearance over the center bar.  On the box it said this bike could be used for children much shorter, but I don't see how.  It is a little bit of a struggle for him to get on the seat but once he is on he has no problems riding it.  Overall, the bike is very nice with 2 types of braking, a back pedal and hand brake.  The styling looks very nice and it arrived with no damage.  I would have given it 5 stars but the directions for putting it together were awful.  The enclosed directions were for bikes and features that this bike did not have and I was flipping back and forth trying to find relevant directions.  Putting it together is somewhat intuitive, and I did figure it out, but better directions would have been much appreciated.

I usually do not endorse a product as "a must have" due to the diversity of personal preference in not just air soft but the firearm community... however, this item is the only exception to my rule.  I got this speed loaded to compliment my MP5 with a 100-round drum and anyone with Carpel-Tunnel Syndrome can testify to, it's a real pain to load THAT much one at a time.  To satisfy this problem, enter the speed loader.

Pretty simple design and execution; open top hatch and insert up to 120 airsoft rounds, place nozzle on top of magazine and prime accordingly.  That easy.  Easily loads a 30-round magazine in less than three seconds.  It's inexpensive and easy to replace if it breaks... which it shouldn't unless you took it in the field and was dumb enough to put it in your front pouch and cracked it when you dove for cover.  Sounds ridiculous but I've seen it done by the Air Force guys I play with.

But let's face it; if you only have so many magazines/drums you're going to want a speed loader to make emergency quick-loads in the field and what better way than to carry it with you.  I strongly suggest you carry it in a side pouch; I carry mine in my BDU pant leg pocket below my hip holster for easy access although I try to carry more magazines in my tactical vest to avoid using it as a last resort.  I strongly recomend against placing it in a pouch in front of you like in a tactical vest since it's made of plastic, not metal.  

Lastly a warning; don't go too overboard with the primer.  Sometimes if you're not watching it you'll overload the magazine/drum and spray airsoft all over whereever you happen to be and either you've wasted ammo or you have to clean it up... unless you're at a friends house, let them clean it up.  ;

If it were possible, I would buy one of these for every airsofter in the world. YOU NEED THIS LOADER!!! Most guns come with those stupid loading tubes that require you to push the bbs down with a stick... That is the worst thing to use while youre getting shot at. This will speed up your loading time dramatically. BUY!!!!

First I want to make a slight correction to the previous reviewer's text: the size/weight of the gloves doesn't change according to the size of your hand but, rather, to the size of you, the user of the gloves. If you are an average sized male you will be hard pressed to find a sparring partner if you only have 10oz gloves: nobody in their right minds would agree to spar with you because with such small gloves the risk of injuring the receiver of the blows goes way up. Hence 16oz is the standard size for sparring gloves. Women can use 14oz and children 14oz and 12oz depending on how big they are. The point with heavier/bigger gloves is to protect your training partner. 
Anyway, on with the review: these are good, all-around sparring gloves. Their over-all quality is quite good and even the velcros are done well so you could use these for thai boxing as well without scratching your partner's neck and shoulders when clinching. However, I found that when you put more power behind your punches your knuckles tend to come through a bit so they're not the safest gloves around. Still they are good enough for pretty much anybody who's looking for a good pair of gloves for sparring. 
I recommend that you get a separate pair of bag gloves or 10oz gloves for bag and mitt work since hitting the heavy bag and focus mitts harden the leather which, again, makes the gloves more dangerous to use in sparring. Remember to wrap your hands and wrists when hitting the heavy bag in order to avoid knuckle, wrist, and shoulder injuries. 
Everlast is a good company and for the most part they make quality products. These gloves do what they are supposed to do

Similar to other reviewers, I was looking for a bench that I could do both abdominal and lower back work.  This was the only decent bench that fit the bill within this price range.  The construction is nice and sturdy, the assembly was no problem, and overall I'm very pleased.  The only thing keeping this from a 5 star rating for me is the lenghth.  I wish the main section were a foot longer, which would allow me to more easily use it with dumbells for chest work.  Although I do love how you can raise the thigh support for curls - I wouldn't have known to do that if it weren't for the photo on this site.  Bottom line: good value for a versatile bench

This bench was the best combination I could find that did both sit ups and hyper back exercises.  It works suprisingly well for what it costs.  The lower leg holder can be set low for back exercises, and set higher for sit ups.  The padding and covers seem decent.  Lots of adjustments.  It's not as heavy duty as the ones at gyms, but for at home I am satisfied

This bar is great when used properly, i.e. make sure the door is closed when you use it.  I was surprised how well it worked, much better than relying on someone to hold your feet while doing situps or cruches.

I recall first hearing about Bag Balm at an adult Scout Leader training retreat.  One of the participants started talking about Bag Balm and how he used it for everything from burns to lip balm.  Needless to say, I was intrigued and, upon returning from the retreat, did a little more investigating.

When I asked my wife whether she had ever heard of the stuff she immediately said that she had and that one of my toddler nephews was then using Bag Balm under a doctor's direction for pesky diaper rash.  I then began to question some of my horse riding buddies.  They too had heard of it and used it with very positive results.

I immediately went out and bought a big tin for my medicine cabinet and a couple of small more portable tins to keep around my office and car and use as lip balm.

I couldn't be more pleased.  I have used Bag Balm as an excellent lip balm and have used it on minor cuts and abrasions as well.  Rubbed directly into the skin.  Under Band-Aids. You name it. The stuff, as originally touted by my Scouting friend, seems also to have antibacterial properties.  Now, I am not a doctor and I don't play one on TV so please don't take that as some sort of prescription. 

Putting it in a nutshell, Bag Balm is incredible stuff and it works.  I highly recommend it!

I write very few reviews, but I just wanted to share my unbelievable success with healing my cracked heels.  I have fought this battle many years, with no success.  I started using this stuff 3 weeks ago, along with a heel sander, and I only have a small scar that I suspect will go away.  I cannot believe the results!!!  I only wish I had taken pictures to proof the results!!  But who wants to look at UGLY cracked heels???  LOL...it WORKS!!!!!!!!!

This has been used by our family forever! We use it on burns, diaper rashes, cuts on our animals, and just about any type of open wound--it works wonders! Plus, this trial-like size makes it perfect for the diaper bag, purse, drawer, or first aide kit

I have used this bench for a little over a week. For the price you can't go wrong. It is sturdy and seems to be well made. The adjustment is smooth and locks firmly in place. (Great for lying leg lifts). All and all this is a good bench, I would have given it five stars, but the description says it can be fully up right for use during military presses, this is not true, it can almost go vertical, but not completely.  Still, I think you would be happy with it, I am.

I got great results coaching 2 teams last season in 2006 using the Zip N Hit as a training aid in addition to live Batting Practice. We would work it into our routine for pre-game drills and starting practice drills.  With every player maybe getting another 20-25 swings at a moving ball at each practice and pre-game session, over a season it adds up to 200-300 extra swings that you can't get from live BP (which takes too long, you must retrieve balls).  Both of my teams last year batted as a team over 0.400 in both Bronco and Pony.  I had several players bat over 0.500 and 0.600, too. It also helped them develop a level swing which improves the Batting average, and become better situational hitters. Other opposing teams also began copying us. Perfect for pre-game warmups where you aren't allowed live BP, i.e. regular games, tournament games.  Our league is now buying one kit for every team in our league as basic equipment. The players can even help drill themselves.

Durability seems to be an issue.  The cord breaks or unravels much too quickly.  The sleeve inside the ball becomes grooved and slows the ball's travel on the cord.  A sleeve made of a harder, slicker material would improve both ball speed and reduce cord wear.  Possible materials are hardened aluminum, stainless steel (polished), teflon-based plastic or polycarbonate

I am a year-round bicycle commuter in Chicago who teaches classes on bike safety 
and riding with children.  I ride all the time at night, often with my kids
in tow.  We bought this as part of a set for my son's bike
two years ago.  It is absolutely phenomenal in it's visibility, durability, 
and ease of use!  I cannot recommend it enough.  I have something of a fetish 
about visibility when we ride our bikes at night.  I have bought just about 
every blinkie light out there.  This is my favorite, along with the Blackburn 
Mars tailight (with 7 LEDs including two amber side lights).  Mind you, the Mars 
is more than 3x the cost of this Bell light.  

Pros--
*extremely visible
*multiple flasher modes
*easy on/off feature for when you are locking up in a public place
*long battery life

Cons--
*the red shield can fall off when the bike is dropped or hits a hard bump.  
We solved this problem by putting a small piece of electric tape on the 
top edge

I bought an older model of the Petzl E32 P Myolite 3 Headlamp a couple of years ago for a trip to the Grand Canyon. Although it works well when on the move, whether for hiking at night, or finding your way to the water cooler or latrine, it has two drawbacks when using it in a fixed location:
- a: even when using the 3-leds (which is the less-bright option), it is so bright that one can not easily use it for reading, nor can one use it in ones tent without disturbing your tent-buddy.
- b: even when using the 3-leds it is so bright that it is difficult to use it to read, since it makes the white of the page reflect back at you.

Also, the weight is a bit heavy on one's head.

It is for these reasons that I just went out and bought the Black Diamond Zenix IQ for my upcoming trip to Yosemite. I have been playing with it in my apartment tonight (with the lights turned off), and I can already tell that this Black Diamond model is far superior to the Petzl I bought 2 years ago. The Zenix IQ has the following features:
- it is much lighter and more comfortable than the Petzel
- it has 6 brightness settings (as opposed to Petzel's 2): it has 3 settings for the two LEDs, and it has 3 settings for the ultra-bright bulb.
- it has a multi-function colored LED that acts as both a headlamp finder in the middle of the night (when you wake up and are looking for your headlamp), and as a battery meter to warn you ahead of time when your batteries are starting to get low

I had trouble getting water in my ears before wearing this cap.  Now no problem!  It keeps my hair fairly dry, or at least drier than with other caps I've tried.  It's easy to put on and take off--no hair pulling.  It's lasted well so far.  Much better than wearing a cap with a chin strap.

I highly recommend the Wenzel Raised Insta-Flex Air Bed over any other air bed out there.  I have had two other brands and Wenzel is the best.  Having a bad back, sleeping on an air mattress is not something I look forward to, but because of the height of this bed and just all around general quality, I have had no back problems and have slept great. The built-in air pump is a dream as well

I purchased a Coleman Exponent F1 Ultralight stove this past spring in preparation for a trip to the Cascades in Oregon. I have owned a liquid fuel stove for years (MSR Whisperlite purchased in approx 1992), and have loved it, but as I am getting older, I have been wanting to trim my pack weight down. I have found the following advantages to the F1 Ultralight.
#1. Easy to use. Simply unscrew the burner head, open the pan supports, screw the burner head back down, screw stove onto canister, light match, twist valve, and you are cooking with gas.
#2. No priming. The liquid fuel stoves required priming, and pumping, which made them harder to use than I would have expected. With this stove, you simply turn the valve and light. No waiting for the generator to heat up.
#3. Very light weight. The stove assembly itself weighs less than just the small fuel bottle for my liquid fuel stove alone. This thing is a feather on the back.
The disadvantages are there as well.
#1. Canister stoves rely on the low boiling point of the fuel to force fuel vapor up and out of the canister, and at temps close to, or below the boiling point, which is close to 0 fahrenheit, the stove simply will not work. For me, where and when I camp, this is not an issue.
#2. Fuel cannot be used as an emergency fire starter. 
#3. Fuel is EXPENSIVE compared to white gas, or unleaded gasoline. 
The owners manual claims this stove only works with Coleman Brand canisters, but I have found that any threaded canister of 70/30 Butane / Propane blend works. I have used Brunton, Coleman, MSR, and some odd black Canister I bought at a gas station in Oregon with it, all with excellent results..
Compared with other canister stoves such as the MSR Pocket Rocket, Brunton Optimus Crux, Snow Peak Giga Power Stove, or Primus Yellowstone Techno Trail, the Coleman Exponent F1 Ultralight had the design that made the most sense to me, sported the lowest weight (.4oz lower than its nearest competitor), and from what I was able to determine in impromptu in store testing, appeared to have the best pot stability of the group, with pot supports that spread out nice and wide. One tidbit about this however is... The Evernew 1.3L Titanium cookpot, is oddly shaped on the bottom, and sits and a slightly odd angle on the F1. I have tried many other pots and this is the only one I have a problem with. The issue is whith the oddly dimpled bottom of the Evernew pot, and NOT with the Coleman stove...
SUMMARY. If you camp where the temps aren't freezing, low weight, ease of use are important, and cost of fuel is unimportant, then this is the stove for you. However you must carry some other sort of emergency fire starter in lieu of having stove gas to start wet wood. If however the cost of fuel is going to be a factor for you, or you are going to go mountain climbing, or whatever, you will want to bypass any canister stove at all, and just go with a gasoline model instead. The Coleman F1 Ultralight is the lightest of the group of stoves I had considered, had the best design, and came in at a price point that I liked. For the majority of backpackers out there, I would say this would be the best stove for you.

The BEST Creatine + Nitric Oxide workout surge

The two most respected bodybuilding supplements are (1)Whey Protein and (2)Creatine. They are also considered natural products or food products. While whey is without a doubt extremely useful, creatine does not help everybody. I have used creatine monohydrate in the past and I found it to be useless. It was so utterly ineffective that I just felt robbed of my hard earned money. My tub still sits in the cupboard. I have never used any other supplement products other than the ones that seem to be on the safe side as these both are. I heard about NO-XPLODE from some bodybuilders who seemed to think it was probably one of the best supplement products to come out in years. I researched it and it appears that BSN has formulated a surging "Creatine + Nitric Oxide" drink that seems to work with most people. Not everybody sees results but this stuff worked for me and that is what counts. Although NO-XPLODE contains some serious chemistry (see below) and possibly some debatable compounds (Guanidino Propionic Acid [GPA] and Glycocamine) it is probably well worth the very low-level risks for the results. 40 minutes after taking this stuff I can either cardio high intensity for 30 min flat (maybe even more) and complete a full range of compound weight lifts in the gym without feeling any interruption in my power. No fatigue. The surge is exactly as it promises. You will feel that you have nitro pumping around your body. It sets in at about 20 minutes for me. I feel a little woozy at first, disorientated, then my brain picks up and my body feels energetic. Put it into action and you will see results.  It also boats a CEM3 type of creatine that prevents you from bloating up like monohydrate does. I never have stepped much outside of what is considered safe but in my opinion NO-XPLODE is standing on the fence saying I am about the best bang for your buck without any serious side effects. So far this stuff is getting very good feedback. Yes it contains lots of mind boggling ingredients, but if you are looking for the creatine edge, even if creatine has never worked for you before, then NO-XPLODE is probably the one. It can also help build muscle, but even if it doesn't for you, it is still worth it for the surge. I am very glad that I got it. Very.

it is very good luggage carrier to withstand the weather conditions - since i used it in the trip when i started it was raining n not drop of water could enter through it and i was worried since i had all my clothes packed in it.
it is very convient to install n uninstall with enough capacity to fit your things in it

First off, let me start by saying that I really like my Summit watch.  It is large (some may go so far to call it HUGE) but it is surprisingly lightweight on my wrist, and quite comfortable to wear.  Those with bad eyesight will STILL be able to see the easy-to-read digital readout of the time, barometric pressure, altitude and compass.  The numbers are quite big, so they are difficult to miss.  

The altitude reading measures in increments of +/- 1 foot, which is about as good as you can get.  I like that.  But what I really like about the Highgear watches that I haven't seen in other brands which offer similar features, is the visual image on the face of the watch telling you what the weather conditions are or will be.  No kidding, this watch will actually show you whether or not it is sunny, partly cloudy, or raining.  Pretty dang nifty if you ask me.  The barometric pressure reading is only a small part of predicting the weather, however after months of use, I have to say that my little watch is WAY MORE accurate than my local TV Weatherman.  I'd say somewhere around 75% of the time what my watch says is exactly what the conditions actually ARE.  Not bad.  It's a feature I would VERY much like to have on my Suunto and Casio models with similar functions.  Until then, I'll rely on my trusty (and much cheaper) Highgear Summit.

If you are considering making the purchase of a wrist watch that offers the digital compass, altitude and barometer functions, before MAKING that specific buy, do some homework and wherever possible, seek out a store where you can actually SEE the watches in person.  Being able to guess the size of a particular model using a picture on the computer can possibly mess up your purchase.  Find the best price, and pull the model out and actually TRY IT ON before you buy.  For me, the Highgear Summit was a good purchase -- however if you would rather enjoy these same functions but in a smaller package, try the Highgear Axis, or possibly the more stylish but much more compact (and WAY MORE expensive) Suunto Observer.  Either way, doing a little homework will pay off in the end.  Happy hiking and I hope this helps you in your efforts to buy the right product.  Good luck

My middle school daughter was always struggling to fit her books in her old backpack which, up until this year worked fine.  I went on-line to find the roomiest one I could, and still get style, color choices and outside pockets. We were amazed at how much room this had inside.  Now all her books fit nicely, and she loves the extra pockets so she can easily find her lunch, pens & pencils, her cell phone and other 'extras'

I have ridiculously large books and a half hour walk to and from the train station each day.  Unlike every other backpack I've tried, the straps of this one have yet to start ripping or fraying apart from the bag.  The only feature I miss is a buckle connecting the two straps across the front of the chest, so they don't pull apart at the shoulders.  However, the bag is heavy-duty and roomy, and I'm easily able to fit my laptop, Con Law book (maybe the largest book ever made), Crim Law book (2nd largest ever), and pocket dictionary.  Overall, if you can get as good a price as I paid for it, I would recommend it to any student or other user..

I've been kicked out of two country clubs for using the Butthead Golf Club Cover, and it appears the only club that allows my membership has been Playworld Putt Putt. There's also no dress code involved there.

Now, on to the review!

I strongly endorse this Butthead Golf Club Cover because it adds an element to golf that would otherwise be forgotten: fun! Those teets really help my handicap like you wouldn't believe. Many clubs have a problem with this cover, because they're incredibly elitist, but when I think of golf, I think of cow teets, and that's why I refuse to play without it

I used mine for two weeks snorkeling in Hawaii. It isn't perfect. It does take on a little bit of water sometimes when you go below the surface, but it isn't enough to cause any problems.

It is pretty easy to clear by just giving a hard quick blow. You probably won't find anything better

I got this gear bag and love it.  It doesn't have a lot of the features you'll see in higher-priced bags; its really just a durable mesh duffle bag, but its great for someone who has a lot of gear they want to carry, and perfect for couples who just want to tote their fins, boots, masks, snorkels, and any other small gear like defog, gloves, knives, wrist compasses/computers, etc

I have used the bottle to take tasty beverages with me on the road, while playing sports, to drink while I am in class.  The bottle washes easily in the dishwasher.  The narrower profile fits easily in cup holders.  I highly reccommend the N-Gen.  It is much larger than 24 oz.  If you fill it all the way to the top you have nearly a quart of capacity.  It is the best functioning and looking drink bottle on the market.  You can also use the bottle as I have to pack small items which you want to be slightly more secure while traveling by air and also keeping some items out of the rain in your backpack.

I bought this croquet set late last summer for backyard get-togethers with the neighbors. None of us had played before, so we didn't need top-of-the-line, and the price was right on this set. It's everything it needs to be: weighty, colorful, and compact in its case. The widgets are pretty bendy, but if they bend out of shape, they bend right back. Turned out to be a good investment. A word of warning if you have small dogs: put them in the house before you let your neighbors loose with mallets and round projectiles. My little dachshund picked up the bad habit of chasing the balls and pushing them further off-course. It was funny, until she darted into the path of one bright orange ball, which made solid contact with her little head. (She's fine now, but is no longer a fan of the game.) All in all, I would highly recommend having a set like this around if you have the room in your backyard and fun neighbors

I don't usually select items by &quot;name brand&quot;, so I tried many other boots before I tried the Timberlands.  But none seemed as well constructed or was as comfortable.  I have had them for 4 months and they have proved waterproof (in rain and puddles, thus far) and have shown very little wear

Timberland's are in no matter what the season.. I mean you can wear them with a pair of khaki shorts in the summer or all your tight winter gear.  You know you can't have just one pair or one color so just go ahead..get them

Some people talk trash on this gun, and on how it's not upgradeable. First of all, if you can find a better gun for 85 bucks, I'd be amazed. Second of all, for just .89 cents, you can buy some teflon tape, and wrap up the hop-up receiver, boosting you another 70 fps. Search online for tutorials. Second, There is a tightbore barrel out, which will boost you only about 20 fps, but greatly increase your accuracy. UTG also has a drop-in cylinder upgrade coming out. So, there are upgrade, they just require manual labor, and you can't just buy them ready to go. If you're willing to put time into your gun, it'll be well worth it. I love this gun. I'm shooting abou

I have been practicing mixed martial arts for four years,and I have gone through all of the major glove brands. In my opinion, Everlast has always provided gloves that provided the most effective wrist support, which means less twisted wrists, especially for beginners. Everything else is well done, but not exceptional - it's comfortable, and provides durable padding, although I myself have only used the 16 oz. versio

Assembles easily and doesn't take up much space.  The quality is good, but I don't think it's strong enough for heavy use.  It's great for small workouts in front of the TV, though.

I didn't know what to expect, but these turned out to be very good quality.  They stretch well and return to shape.  They don't feel like they are going to snap apart when you are in the middle of exercising.  I was very pleased with the product.  Be careful, though, if you have a latex allergy.  I also got excellent service from the company!  I would definitely do business with them again

This step is great.  It really adds variety to my home workout.  I use it on carpet and it really stays put.  It doesn't slip on the carpet, and I don't slip when I step on it.  I was a little worried because it didn't have a rubber stepping surface, but it really doesn't need it with regular athletic shoes

I have arthritis (psoriatic), diabetes, high blood pressure, heel spurs and Osteopenia (a pre-Osteoporosis state)and I'm 240lbs. A real grab-bag of conditions to deal with! I saw what happened when my Mother broke her hip and I really didn't want to have that happen to me. But, how to exercise? Using a warm "therapy" swimming pool was about the only exercise I could do and that will not provide the weight-bearing exercise needed to re-form bone. Just walking around is cheap, but I'm a female and my neighborhood is not really well-lit and has gone downhill a bit, too. I just didn't feel safe walking around at 2:am or whenever *I* was up for exercise. Besides there were hazards like uneven pavement, high curbs and all the issues of weather to deal with. I had seen the ads on TV for the Gazelle line of exercise equipment and it seemed to be ideal for me. I could exercise my knees and hips in regular gravity conditions or add resistance if I needed to, without any arthritis-taunting up and down impact on my joints. No more worries about where I was stepping and into what. I could exercise whenever I wanted and not disturb anyone in the neighboring apartments. I could go as "far" as I liked and wouldn't have to worry about being exhausted from going too far from home and not being able to make it back.

So, I got the Gazelle and I LOVE it!
I chose this model (The Power Plus)for my use but also because my best friend is 340lbs and this will take up to 350lbs. From the way it is constructed - which is very strong and SOLID, I'm not sure that's really it's upper limit. This is not some flimsy, cheaply constructed rip-off.  It does not move, sway or "walk" when I use it. Yet, with the handles on the side, I'm able to lift the back of the Gazelle up onto the front wheels and move it fairly easily, which really suprised me since it is such a heavy-duty machine.

Any downsides? It did have a small bit of squeaking at first, but it never got to the point where I'd be worried that I was disturbing anyone. Because it is built so solid, it does command a bit of space. Not too much, but it is not a model that will fold up so you'll need to commit room for it and enough room for the swinging motion. I'd want to safety-fence off around it to protect pets and kids from getting too close when it's in action.

Over-all I am VERY pleased with this item!
Well done, Fitness Quest

I bought one of these, based from a review. I pretty much agree with her, the machine is great and it gives a good workout. But she forgot to mention, the thing can cause your feet to get sore! I tried wearing high quality running shoes and it still hurt. I received an advice to attatch foam strips to the runners that you stand on, and that has solved the problem! So far, I have not used the pistons, so it's just a cardio workout. I have Tony's tapes he sells on his website and his music cd's, and I do get a very good workout! I have lost 13 pounds so far by using it, and I noticed it defanitely toned up the buns

There's not a lot of information out there on using this extractor for cars, because I think most people buy it for boats instead.  So I'm going to talk about how well it works on changing the oil in your car.

In summary, it works great.  It's really nice being able to change your oil on your own time and at your own home without getting dirty.  I'm never going to Jiffy Lube again.  It even works great on my lawnmower.

Using the extractor is very easy.  Just remove your dipstick, insert the extractor's tube into the dipstick hole until the end reaches the bottom of the oil pan (it might take some practice to get a feel for this part).  Once everything is in place, pump 10-20 times.  This will cause a the extractor to suck out the oil like a straw.  It takes about 15 minutes for 3 quarts.  That's also why I recommend the 6-liter model instead of the 2.5-liter one, so that you can suck out all the oil in one shot.

Some people wonder whether all of the oil is removed this way.  Unfortunately, I can't really speak to that, because that would require me to open the drain plug and investigate.  However, the consensus from stuff I've read on the Internet is that the extractor does remove as much oil as the traditional method.

Because changing my oil is so easy with the extractor, I always change my oil on time.  Previously, I drove for thousands of miles past my "due date" because stopping for an oil change was too inconvenient.  The extractor should be used after the engine has been running.  The oil is less viscous and the contaminants are stirred up, making the extractor more effective.

Also, please remember that your old oil must be properly recycled.  Most mechanic shops will accept your old oil (I put it in a plastic orange juice container), just call ahead to make sure

The plastic side mounts (4) appear to be solid and not flimsy.  I replaced the 12 supplied screws with actual stainless steel ones, (you know, since this is going on a boat!) But at least the hooks to attach the cooler are stainless.  The package says "includes all stainless mounting fasteners" So I guess that means hooks only.  The supplied screws are not even galvanized. So if you plan to affix these mounts permanently to a boat, go get stainless screws that are also 1/2" longer than the ones provided.
All in all it's a nice kit but a little pricey for what you get

First off I need to tell you that I've carried a swiss knife since I was a kid. I have most of the styles. But this one stands out as the absolute most useful for a rather strange reason. For me since I don't fish I found more uses for this in the most unexpected area. The "fish scaler" tool is one that I would NEVER use to scale fish for no other reason than the problem of having to clean it thoroughly, too much work. But this tool I have used more than any other on all my knives. I've used it to open ceiling hatches to change office lights, pick locks. to measure things (something you need more often than you think), to reach into thin areas to clear debris or push a switch and most of all as a back scratcher. Since there are no sharp edges on the scaler it's perfect to scratch those areas one can't reach. That's not to ignore all the rest of the tools this knife offers which I use except for the absurd "parcel hook". This tool is useless and yet Victorinox continues to install it on many knives. The only useful task I've found for the hook is to tighten one's laces on my boots when I snow shoe. Anyone else found something useful for the parcel hook? Please post it if you have

This paddle is a bargain here at Amazon.  Sports stores would easily sell this for over $20.  Having said that, I found it to be slightly heavier and the thicker sponge made it difficult for me to adjust my game.  "BUT", I still eliminated many a younger player at our men's retreat.  There's nothing better than seeing the face of a 23 year old when a 53 year old kicks his rear!  Thanks, Stiga

These bands were recommended by our son's summer camp and we were quite skeptical about them.  But they seem to be working very well and are comfortable to wear.  Our son likes them much better than the sprays and smelly lotions that we used to use and never really worked.  Before using these bands, his legs and arms were covered with bites.  We are very pleased with them and highly recommend them to others

After polishing alloy wheels I treated them with Boeshield. It leaves a waxy film that attracts dust and dulls the finish, however there is no sign of tarnish or oxidation. Very easy to clean off when you want really bright wheels

This is a great bike.  I gave one to my 2 and4 year old to share for Christmas.  It is winter here so they ride it through the house all the time.  My son has really struggled with 2 wheel bikes because the typical bike easily crashes when you turn the handle bars too hard.  This bike is made so the turning radius is very small. The bike is light enough that he just picks it up a little to make a big turn.  No problem. He goes sailing through the house now with NO crashing.  Once the weather is good enough to go outside he is going to have a ball.  He will definately graduate to a standard bike after this teaches him balance.  He should be able to skip the obnoxious training wheels altogether.   
My short 2 year old loves it but she has to go slowly because she can barely reach the floor.  In a few months she should be fine and I'm guessing by this summer she'll be sailing on it.   GREAT FUN.   Unfortunately the price is very hard to swallow.  I found one on sale through a design website so I could manage it.   If the money won't bankrupt your budget or you can save for it, it's worth it

This is the second Vector I have purchased.  My first six year old one has gotten beat up and the compass no longer works.  The watch has a large dial and is a little bulky, but you get used to it.  You trade that for a large easy to read dial.  The watch has more features than you can use and a large instruction manual to go with it. It has the compass, barometer, temperature, and altimeter.  The 6 hour barametric pressure history box is nice to warn you of incoming bad weather.  The watch is a nice instrument, but I would warn against abusing it. It is shock resistant, not shock proof

This may be the 'outdoorsy' ubergeek watch. It's big, it's ugly, but has functions to make the fattest Swiss Army Knife sit in the corner sobbing in jealousy. Overall, I like it but there are a couple of things that sound better than they are. 

The timepiece: Outstanding. It has HH:MM:SS DD:MMM, of course, with a year setting to avoid leap year issues. This should go without saying in a modern digital watch. Stopwatch with lap function (not that I ever use the lap function, but I'm sure someone is interested). Countdown timer that can run up to a 24 hour countdown (very easy to set). Three daily alarms. Special kudos for the alarms, this is one of the loudest watch alarms I've heard, and I've missed too many watch alarms to not appreciate this. 

The Altimeter: largely eye candy, but kind of neat. Over four days, my bedroom went from 100m above sea level to 25 m below sea level (by the maps, about 40m ASL). Not surprising because it is driven by the barometer, and I never recalibrated it, but a graphic demonstration of the importance of calibrating it when you want/need it. 

The Barometer: Yup, it's a barometer. The part I like is the little display that shows the rising/falling trend, especially as this is always active (even in normal 'time' mode). 

The Thermometer: Take the watch off to get an accurate reading as the sensor is too close to the wrist. 

The compass: Easily the best 'special' feature. Accurate, precise (enough for orienteering, not for surveying), easy to use. It can be programmed for a declination, but knowing me, I'd forget to reset it, so I do declination the hard way. The sighting notches are small but servicable. The spirit level bubble is unique among digital watch compasses to Suunto, and greatly enhances accuracy and confidence in the compass. An outstanding wrist compass. 

The package: Big. Really, really big. But the controls are very easy to use and seem fairly resistant to accidental button pressing (a problem for me with other watches). The battery has a shortish (12-18 month) life, but has a hatch, so you don't need to take it to a jeweller to get it replaced without ruining the water resistance. The display has large characters and high contrast to the back ground, and the display light is just right, readible, even, and glare free, but not an emergency flashlight. Personally, I'm going to swap the resin band for a velcro strap, but the stock strap isn't bad, just not great. 

Overall, not a watch for the office or a suit but very good as a watch, compass and barometer, and about what you could expect as a thermometer and altimeter. Well designed, thought-out, and manufactured, but really big.

I purchased the Kwik Kik for my 11-year-old to use as a training aid for the recreational soccer program he is involved with.  It was fairly easy to put together and, once the base is filled with sand (it cannot be filled with water), it's simple to move it from place to place.  The Kwik Kik is a great way to build up the strength and stamina in his feet and legs!  I love the fact that he can use it either in-doors or out-doors, so he'll be able to use it to keep training throughout the year.  Great Product

Very high quality/durability. This glove works well as it should. Only complaint (splitting hairs here) is that it gets pretty hot pretty fast, and your hand will sweat. If you are an extreme sweater, you may want to sacrifice the quality construction of this glove for one that is more well ventilated.

I've owned my first pair of "Big Grip" gloves for over three years now and they're still in great shape (for a time I was lifting four times a week).  I only bought a second pair to keep in reserve in case Harbinger discontinues them.
The only down side for me is the finger length.  The glove's fingers, at least on my hands, end right at the second joint and are mildly annoying when you bend you fingers until the gloves break in.  After that, though, they're great

We purchased this item for our 15 year old daughter when we spent a week in the Keys. The DVD gave her a good overview of how to use the mask/snorkel. The mask and snorkel were of good construction and kept water out. This was a great product and a good price for what we needed and used it for.

I thought the speedsafe was a button that you press which flings the knife open.  I was dissapointed to find that it is just a spring that helps it open faster.  Other than that, this knife is ultra high-quality, definately the best I have owned

I hate to feed into the mentality that causes knifemakers to hype their blades as "tactical," because the last thing we need to give lawmakers is another excuse to heroically protect us by banning the tools we carry. But the first and last thing I have to say about the Ken Onion Tactical Blur is that it is one fearsome knife.

A curved blade would be suited to your usual cutting and slicing applications, such as skinning mastodons and so on. This knife, on the other hand, has a chisel-like tanto point, which is ideal for thrusting effortlessly through beef ribs or car hoods. It would be equally at home cutting up cardboard boxes, linoleum flooring, or metal garbage cans.

Technically, this isn't a switchblade. Switchblades are bad. We know this because our lawmakers have heroically protected us by effectively banning them at various levels. This is only an ordinary liner-lock knife with spring-assisted opening. But if I ever found a switchblade with the deployment speed and cutting power of the Blur, I'd say it was quite a knife.

The blade is shaving-sharp from the factory, and the handle is lightweight but sturdy aluminum with some kind of gritty sandpaper-like stuff glued on to give a better grip should the knife become slippery with any sort of fluid. Use your imagination. I haven't tried shattering any cinderblocks with it yet, but it's sturdy enough to use as a yawara stick in a pinch.

Folded, the whole package can be palmed even in my small hands and feels much like a disposable lighter with a glandular problem. I don't even notice it in my hip pocket, which is where it rides whenever I happen to be wearing pants. 

If walking around with something this fearsome seems too naughty for you, remember a couple of things. One is that you can buy it from The Wall for $55, and The Wall would not sell naughty things to naughty people. Another is that crimes, to my knowledge, are not generally committed with knives like these, but with such evil implements as kitchen knives, screwdrivers, and whatever happens to be lying around near the crime scene. Lastly, you will probably not need a knife this fast and ferocious, but if you do, you will *really* need it. And you'll have it

I had my knife for 10 years, and would still have it, if not for the 2nd instinct of putting it in my back pocket whenever I leave the house. One night I was heading for a flight, at the airport, going thru security; when I realized I had it on me, I had no choice but to throw it out. So had to get another one

Quick shipping/ but poor packaging. There was obvious chips of metal from the structure in the packaging and one of the main SCREW and BOLTS pagackages were already open (lucky i found all) Bad packaging BUT EXCELLENT bench. It takes a decent bit of assembly but it fit perfect in my 2 car garage and still lets 1 car in. Great multi-function product. You can do all core lifts and also do lats and curls to build the minor muscles for definition. Pretty sturdy structure but seems a tad bit hallow (no problems yet) for a hundred fifty five bucks with free shipping (another 155 value) It was REALLY worth it. I say to anyone who likes it, its worth it. Just get it. Wether your a pro or beginnger its good for getting stronger and adding mass

I bought this bike after not riding since I was 14 (32 now).  The box arrived in excellent condition and the bike was nearly completely assembled.  I also had a little trouble with adjusting the front brake but got it figured out.  Overall this is a great bike for those casual trips around town.  I'm not a trail seeker, so have never tried it off road.  Very happy with the quality and ease of assembly

The bike was delivered 70% (rough guesstimate) put together. It was relatively easy to complete myself (only had to use manual a few of times) and i'm certainly no expert.

The only problem I encountered, was getting the front brake pads to align properly on the tire. With that being said.... I spent a few dollars at our local bike/cycle shop to have it looked over (basic tune-up service) to make sure it was safe to ride.

The bike now rides nicely and serves as my cruise around town bike. Overall, I think this is good value for the money... but only if you're looking for a hybrid type bike for shorter (more casual) trips

I take power or ashtanga based classes 3 times a week.  So when I travel on business taking a mat along isn't the best plan.  So I purchased these and when I traveled they were great on the hotel carpet.  I read some of the other reviews that they aren't durable and I don't think these were designed for everyday use.  Regardless, I love them for travel or when I can't make it to the yoga studio

The one I bought is green and black - looks good in the water. I first look this kayak (dingy really) out into the Gulf of Mexico. The swells were two two three feet and the harder I paddled the behinder I got. I thought I had made a bad purchase but then I took the dingy into Clearwater Bay with much calmer waters and I'm having the time of my life. 

Paddling is slow going - 2 to 3 miles per hour at most but I've gone a couple of miles and back all along the bay. I bought a Coleman pump that runs on 4D batteries and I can inflate and deflate it five times before I need to change batteries. This kayak is the best $70 I've ever spent. Great exercise too

The pedometer is just too sensitive!!  It tends to over state the number of steps that I have taken. I like the item but I cut the number of steps that I have taken by third.  So, if I am tageting 10,000 steps a day I try to go 13,333 so that I can be sure that I really hit my target. The item itself is well made, light weight and easy to use and set.

I've purchased 3 tubes of this brand.  The product works as advertised.  I have bigger thighs and use it to prevent chafing while I'm walking around at work.  This product is especially a lifesaver during the hot summer months.  There are other brands on the market, but this is far the best value I have found.  Thank you Sportslick, keep making your product and if it's not selling, find different distribution channels

This is a nice sword for $35 (plus tax). When I removed the sheath, there was some sort of goo on the blade (probaby so it wouldn't rust). This is a carbon blade, so don't leave it in a moist closet for 1 or 5,376 years(by then the rusted blade alone will be worth a fortune). Just dont get the blade wet, ok. You can rub a moist towel across it to get rid of the rust protector if you're going to use it often but that is pretty much all you can do to clean it without a special kit. Please dont brandish this sword around like a bad actor in a kung-fu movie. You could realy hurt someone with the point of the blade. I think this is shipped over seas, so dont challenge your friend to a violent battle the day after you buy this and you should be fine. Blue Dragon is actualy a japanese video game that no one bought. I think it was based on a part of final fantasy 2. I don't want to bore you with video games, so i'll get to the point. Put it on display, dont cut your lawn with it, dont play ninja with it, and dont ever ever ever ever ever ever try to cut a solid object in half with it (prefrebly a tin can) because the cheap blade could fly off the tang and hurt you (or prefrebly your neibor) in the face. Please don't throw the blade at your neibor either. P.S. I am not neil meislin, I am his son, daniel meislin. If you can't understand my numerous perenthesis, I guess you're not smarter than a 5th grader.

I mainly got this watch so that it would be easier to orient myself if I was lost or giving direction via the compass but now that I have it I wouldnt know what I would do without it. A Great Purchase

The dials/gages appear to be very good quality and look very nice.  They are very accurate as far as I can tell in comparing them to my LaCross Clock/Weather gage and the local weather reports and web reports.

The Hygrometer may be off by 2% but am not convinced this is true as yet and I can adjust it.

I set the barometer to +1.1" for my 1050' above sea level.

I wish the clock was not a loud tick tick tick.  It is not that bad, but I would rather not have that at all as my ears very easily pick up on things like that.

The one thing I do not like is that I should have checked the dimensions of it.  I am not sure if they were listed when I bought it.  So check the size of what you think you life before you purchase.  This one seems a little small.  Not the gages but the mounting board.  It could be a little wider and a little taller.

I also, somehow messed up on buying one that had such a boring mounting board.  I would have liked a beveled arch on the top or such.  The wood is good quality and the varnish appears to be top notch.  I don't mark down for this.

I mark down for the size of the mounting overal as it could be taller and wider.  Not buy much, but maybe an inch wider and 2' taller.

Overal I like it alot.  I just did not realize how plane jane it was in mounting and size.

The Ultrastar is a classic disc, wonderful to throw and catch.

I personally feel that Ultrastars vary based on the color, but I just may be imagining things.

These fly better than the average Whammo, although I feel that I can throw 180g Innova Pulsars a little bit further. Still, the Ultrastar has more curvature and has a nice stable flight pattern.

I've thrown the Adidas 175g as well, and while that is not as bad as a beat-up whammo, it's still not quite the same

You owe it to yourself to own a flashlight made using the Cree XR-E LED.  It's roughly TWICE as bright as the currently comparable Luxeon LED.  Also, the "regulator" circuitry keeps the light at a fairly constant level through the life of the battery (not all LED flashlights have this feature).  It's small enough to be put on a keychain, yet puts out a powerful beam

I already owned a Fenix P1 which amazed me with the impressive light it threw from something so tiny.  It was easily small enough to fit on my key chain and so it is always with me.  Even a great light source is useless if it's not accessible when you need it.  I owned a Surefire Ultra which is a great flashlight but obscenely expensive.  But you could feel the quality and knew it would last a few decades.  I love the rear clicky button design and the 5 levels of light.  I expected some similar design elements in this new Fenix. I was disappointed to see that to switch to the different settings you have to screw the collar left right, then left right again and so on.  So if there is one setting you use most often, you must go through the whole 5 turns just to get back to it next time.  Come on, that's just stupid.  I will keep it only to avoid the exchange hassle and it still is a good value considering the size and light output especially compared to the uberpriced surefires.  But there is no comparison as far as construction or quality. So 4 stars is all I could muster for the crude setting selection method design and the adequate but toylike feel of the casing construction.

I bought one of these lanterns three years ago at the local discount store.  I have used it numerous times on camping expeditions.  It outputs very bright light at full blast.  The lantern is quick to light and the best part is it does not require matches.

The only three issues I have with this lantern are:
1. Sucks the propane.  I also have the coleman fuel lantern, and while it is not as bright, it can go for a week of camping on one tank (5 cups) of fuel.  
2. Loud.  This lantern is loud when burning.  The above mentioned lantern is much quieter.
3. Construction -- the fiberglass (?) base around the knob has disintegrated from my thumb rubbing it when trying to light the lantern.  Hopefully this will not affect the longevity of the lantern.

I'd recommend it if you are looking for convenience and bright light, but if you are looking for value, go with the old dual mantle coleman fuel (pump up) lantern.

If you are out in the cold and its important for your hands to be warmed then you need these hand/pocket warmers!

They are even great for just being outside for a walk!  I have poor circulation and MUST keep my hands warm to avoid pain and these warmers do the trick

I was/am a runner who constantly was sustaining leg injuries of one type or another.  I finally yielded to the fact that I needed to seriously cross train and reduce my running.  I decided to row, however I abhore having to spend tons of cash on exercise equipment to work out indoors when running is virtually free outside.  I originally wanted to spend only a few hundred dollar so at least I could get my work outs in and see if I really liked rowing.  After reading every review I could find, I decided that it may be in my best interest to spend more than a few hundred dollars.  When I chose the Body Craft VR100 rower I figured that I would still be compromising quality since it was a mid-priced unit.  I didn't want to listen to things click and clack, and have to tighten things that would loosen over time. Much to my amazement, this rower Rocks!  It was really easy to put together, the parts are high quality, and the important thing is when you row you don't even think about the fact that you are on a machine.  It's solid, steady, smooth, and a great workout.  I use it 4-5 days a week for 45 mintues each time and have had it for about 1 month.  It feels just as good as the day I bought it.  If you are thinking about purchasing a rower, I highly recommend this one.

This is the Harbinger you need unless you are going to be power lifting only then I suggest you look into the 12xx series but they are for very quick lifts and not for wearing more than ten minutes because they are like wearing boxing gloves. If you want to spend time in the gym lifting say the big three like squats, deadlifts and bench presses for a couple of sets then the Harbinger 140 Pro WristWrap Glove is exactly 100% what you need. I would never, and I mean never, buy another glove again simply on the bases that every other type of glove I have used has split within two months of use while Harbinger just lasts through deadlift upon deadlift upon deadlift and looks as good as the day I bought them. The wrist strap is a really nice touch, very long and wraps around and around to keep those wrists nice and firm for the big lifts. You go to the gym and you want a pair of gloves that will support you and last longer... look no further. Buy them

The Firm just keeps getting better and better!  They're products are WONDERFUL!  I've been using The Firm videos for a looooong time and I LOVE them!!  The cardio-weight training does wonders for your body!  Now with the TransFirmer system, this is definitely a challenging workout - even for me and I've been an advanced exerciser for over 20 years.  I love the incline step...you can really feel the difference.  You can also increase the intensity or you can do it less intense as well. It gives you great variety with the height of the step, weights, incline, etc.  THIS IS AN AWESOME WORKOUT...I LOVE EVERY DVD!!  Very challenging and I'm am very happy I bought this.  The step is wonderful and very sturdy!  This is the only step you'll ever need...for all your Firm workouts!

I would give this 3.5 stars if possible. Its a decent table, the chip holders/with cup holders are easy to rearrange accoring to preference. The Table itself seems to be a piece of plywood, with some green felt tacked both sides of it; and slots cut out for the chip trays. 

It works, but could have been a nicer, better made product for the money. 

Watch out for the shipping costs,  almost 1/3 the price of the table. Pretty expensive

For some reason the electronic control panel doesn't work on my bike.  But I don't mind too much.  The bike is small and light but has enough mass so it doesn't slide around.  I use the bike while doing work, watching TV or reading.  It's a great way to get exercise on rainy days

I am not an exercise person.  But, I need to keep moving and others in my family have bone issues that mean they shouldn't exercise in a manner that stresses the joints.  This machine is perfect for all of us.  I put the machine together and found it to be quite sturdy and fairly heavy.  The electronics on it are working just fine.  It's the kind of exercise machine that I can get on, watch TV, and forget I'm actually exercising

The product works as anticipated.  I was disappointed that the packaging was missing golf tips that were advertised as being included.  This advertising was imprinted on the product's box so it was not just a stick-on label afterthought.  I think someone tampered with the box before shipping

...or shall we shag later?  Now if they could figure out how to tee the ball up for me I wouldn't have to bend over at all!  But seriously, I find this product to be a vast improvement over the old shag stick that I was using.  I haven't used it on real grass though, just on the practice mat and net I have set up in my garage.  Given the consistent way the Shag Pro serves 'em up, I think it would also work fine out back

This is a good jogger if you will be using it for more than just jogging.  I really like the fact that it has a front swivel wheel that you can lock for jogging and unlock if you need more manuverability.  It comes with cup holders, which is nice because a lot of joggers you need to puchase them as an accessory.  Overall it is a good stroller, the only thing that I would change in the design would be the wheel locking feature.  It has 2 individual locks, one for each wheel.  The jogger I had previously had a bar across the back that would lock both wheels at the same time when pressed.  I am extremely satified with the stroller for the price at which I purchased it

I bought this stroller after much research and deliberation.  It is comfortable for my [...]as well as my [...]daughter.  It handles wonderfully. It folds pretty well too.  The front swivel wheel makes a huge difference with manuverability and the adjustable handle bar is a great feature. I am tall and it helps to have the handle where I need it.   I have used this for both walking, shopping and jogging and think it is perfect!  From purchase to delivery it took maybe 5 days.  I am extremely happy with all aspects of this purchase.  I love this stroller!

I bought this product to use during my camping trips. I had a minor issue with my order but was corrected immediately, great customer service. This is a really neat hammock, it packs really small but is very resistant. My friends loved it when they saw it and it was really easy to set up. You will enjoy it whether you go camping or on your backyard

Had this device for 3 months, absolutely love it! The chest strap you must wear in order to detect your heart rate takes a little time to adjust to, but it is very accurate. The most useful feature offered that is not included in many heart rate monitor devices on the market is being able to keep track of the distance you ran, the speed (max and average), and calories expended. This allows you to control your pace while running by speed, or because some days your body may react differently to exercise and may fluctuate; you can change your training accordingly with the heart rate monitor function. You are also able to easily program the watch so that it will alert you once you've reached a target heart rate, or time, or speed, and even resting rates, laps, etc., essentially letting you program your interval training. Distance is very accurate once calibrated manually. Never owned a gps based heart rate monitor before, but I chose this the gps based hrm because I need reliability (according to some reports on gps based hrm, the gps signal is weak when running in places with trees or tall buildings). Besides, if I get lost, I figure the extra running can't hurt me =

I really like the heart rate monitor and it works great.  As has been said, it takes some time learning all it does, but it's worth it in my opinion.  The only thing I was not real excited about was the pace jumps around quite a bit, but from what I have been told by others and their brands of running watches, they all do this to an extent.  Everything else I'm quite happy with and would highly recommend it to anyone. The distance reading has been right on the money after calibration.

If you are looking for complete information about the training or fitness activity and want to analyze to improve your performance or avoid overtraining this is the unit.
- Very nice software, a lot of nice information very well presented
- Speed sensor is reliable and accurate (does not suffer all kind of interfence such as GPS units) - error is really smaller than 5% even during long runs
- The information available during and after the exercise is great (temperature, altitude, calorie count, all HRM metrics such as average, maximum, %)
- Bike sensor provides speed, distance, etc
- Fitness test is a nice measure of improvemen

LOVE this knife.  Looks great, sharp as can be out of the box.  Thin enough for the pocket of my khakis.  One disclaimer, use the safety.  It opened up in my pocket once (no clue how) and could have been dangerous

Great little knife.  I've taken to carrying it with me on every occasion my Native is too big.  Super sharp and keeps its edge even after some pretty heavy use.  Only beef is that it's a little hard to open and close with one hand because of its size.  I'm going to have to get the leek

I purchased this knife for about $4 cheaper than its usual Amazon listing price at Amazon's Friday Sale.  I had been looking at the Kershaw knives for awhile, and following an incident in my building's parking garage (woman accosted, pocketbook stolen), it seemed like the perfect time to buy.  The "rainbow" titanium-coating color might bother some men, but I'm a woman, so I don't mind the color of the knife. I would have preferred the black-on-black, but this was too good a deal to pass up.

The safety lock looks like it might slip out of safety easily, but in two weeks time of regular wear/use, I haven't had a problem. I flip the knife open often (heck, it's fun), and I wear it regularly (what's the point of having it, if you're not prepared to use it?).  The thin attached metal "belt clip" is very sturdy and multipurpose (it looks similar to the metal clip on a writing pen). Not only can I clip the kninfe just inside my slacks waistband, but it clips easily to the inside leather pocket of my purse.  The single finger flip-open mechanism is beyond belief - very easy to use, exceptionally fast and accurate.  The locking mechanism (keeps the blade in place) is extremely solid, and has worked without flaw.  When I'm walking anyplace suspicious by myself, I hold the knife in the "ready to flip open" position in my hand, held down at my side.  The knife is nearly invisible in that position, so I don't stand out as "oh my God, she's carrying a knife!" However, someone intent on a criminal act just might notice, and avoid me altogether.  Great knife for personal safety.  Lastly, like the other reviews point out, these knives are SHARP. I don't use mine to open letters, boxes and typical pocket knife activities (I believe that would gum it up, and slow the opening speed of the knife), so I anticipate the blade should have a good, long life in my care.

We got this as a family gift for Christmas. We love the red color, and it's great to have out at most holidays. The kids were so excited to roll it around, and hear the ice inside. They didn't believe it at first that it was really making ice cream. The anticipation drove them crazy. But it was fun for everyone. I fully recommend this product. We are a family of 4 with the mega ball. At first I wasn't sure if it would be enough, but we even had leftovers. And I love the fact that it comes with recipes for different flavors. I would give it 10 stars if I could

We purchased the Mega ball and have made ice cream twice in 2 weeks. The kids think its great. It takes a good half hour or more, but worth it. Make sure you have a really good stiff plastic spatula for scraping the sides of the container, it can be hard to get off. Really easy to clean

Despite what the other reviewer has said, this table is great. I delpoyed to Iraq with this table folded up nicely in my duffle bag with no problems. The table is lightweight, and stirdy as long as you set it up correctly. I use it for my laptop indoors, but outdoors it works great as well (provided a hurricane isn't trying to blow it around) Overall, it's a great table that's compact and easy to set up and break down. My only complaint is that the plastic tabletop slats are thin plastic and if you have any heavy items sitting in the middle of the table it will bow a little unless you place the items directly on top of the support beams. I'd buy another if I had the need for one, and everyone in Iraq has complimented me on it because they're stuck trying to find ironing boards or water boxes to set their laptops on.

I work out at home using dumbells and a number of bodyweight exercises.  My dumbbell collection had grown cumbersome and messy, so I looked around for a way to organize these dumbells in my room, and this rack was perfect.  I did look at a number of racks both online and in RL, but the majority were way over my budget, had crippling shipping charges or were too limited in terms of their capacity to space ratio.  I was just about ready to fabricate my own when I found this on Amazon. After reading the reviews and crunching the numbers, I decided to give this a shot.  I'm happy to report this has completely solved my dumbbell storage problems. 
***
This rack arrived a couple of days before anticipated; with the use of a single crescent wrench, I put it together without assistance in the space of an hour or so.  Well within 2 hours of opening the box, it was in place and holding weights. It is solidly made of heavy gauge steel and quality welds covered in a tough tactile coating material.  The construction method is of simple carriage bolt and nylon insert locknut assembly. It ships with rubber coverings for the feet and all orifices.
***
The actual dimensions of this rack are 36.75" x 24" x 32" (W x D x H).  Add at least a foot to the height for the minimum workable usage space (for lifting the weights in and out).  I have filled it's available space with sets of 10-50# dumbbells in 5# increments.  For the past month, it has held 540# and remained absolutely rock solid.  From the feel of the thing, it could hold easily twice this weight without issue.
***
Highly recommended for personal use or even tight boutique space.

My wife and I love this product.  Now, it's not for backpacking, but it does work great as a car camping or base camp stove.  It does require one of those disposable propane tanks (which can be tough to dispose of), and it might make sense to get the carrying case (not seeing it attached here).  But besides that, a great, simple stove which can be used in all kinds of conditions

We bought this for my daughter when she was around 2 months old and she has loved it ever since.  We just moved her to a big girl bed because we have another one on the way, and she just wouldn't part with it.  My husband attached it to her bed and she still uses it to soothe herself back to sleep at night. (Almost 22 months old).

I was so disappointed to see that Fisher Price doesn't make this item anymore and had hope to find another new or used one for the new baby, but the prices people are asking here are outrageous

We purchased 4 sets of fins and masks for a trip to Jamaica. We were very happy with the US Divers product. The price was right and the fins worked just as expected. They worked just as good as sets we have rented. Rather than renting fins at the beach, we now have sets to use the next time we travel to the ocean

I bought this for when I work on my car/motorcycle in my apartment building's parking lot. The lighting is poor, and I've found headlamps to be an absolute necessity.

I bought this one because it seemed to have the properties I was looking for- a wide, even swath of light for close-in handy work. After comparing to several other lights on a site that is easily findable by searching for "flashlight reviews", I decided on this one.

Having bought it, I actually wish I had gone for the Princeton Tec Quad. The thing is- this headlamp is extremely bright. It has two buttons to select the light output- one chooses between using all 8 LED's, 5, 3 or just 1. The other chooses between full output, "dimmed" output, and a flashing mode. Even with 5 LED's on the dimmed output, there is plenty of light for me to see what I'm doing. 

The reason I say it's *too* bright is that with 3 AA batteries, it's kind of heavy. Basically, I wish I had went for the Quad, which has 4 LED's and traded off the excess light output for something lighter and more comfortable

I just read the other reviewer's comments.  Yes, the bag isn't huge, but it certainly gets the job done.  It's not the over-sized bag where you can stuff 6 full sized textbooks, but it's a bag that has style.  That's why I got it.  It's a bit more european in its design, and is of good quality.  I dont expect zippers to break anytime soon.  Look to be good quality.  Also, at this price--it is such a good deal

I used this for paintball on my military simulation A-5. I see other sights and I was worry about this since its cheaper. The red and green dot is MUCH more visible then my brother in law more expensive BSA also. 
About the manufacture website, it is a 40mm. Dont know why they said 30mm. But like some sight, the lens (both front and back) are both 40mm but theres a inner tube that control the up/down/left/right of the laser and it decrease the viewable area just slightly. Overall, it worked great. I can tease/tuant my teammates with pinpoint shots near them.

Estos son los guantes que mas me gustan para nadar. Mucho mejores que los aqua sphere. El asunto es que duran poco. Despues de unas 50 idas a nadar, ya estan muy rotos y hay que conseguirse otros. Tambien hay que tener cuidado con el tamao. Yo tengo manos grandes y solo me sirven bien el tamao medium. Por el resto el producto es muy bueno, y comodo.

I'm serious about acqua aerobics and the upper body workout I can get by using these high-resistance water gloves. The unique velcro closure is a great improvement over other types which were a struggle to get on and off. Wish they had a "Medium" choice of size. They only make a S and a L. These gloves were a great find and the price was right

This is my 4th pair of aqua fitness gloves, my 2nd pair of this exact Speedo Aqua Fitness Glove.  Allowing the fingers to protrude through the ends of the gloves is a great benefit.  With other gloves, water builds up inside the glove and, if lycra-backed for example, the glove becomes like a big balloon after a short while.

These Speedo gloves allow the water to pass through the glove and out the finger-holes.

In addition, the material the gloves are made of is much sturdier than other gloves I have had. The palms hold up well as do the backs.

I recommend these gloves and will always use them in my water fitness exercises

Overall this is a great little knife.  It opens fast, is very sharp and holds it's edge well and feels good in your hand.  The liner lock is great.  I have used some others and absolutely hated them because they were so hard to operate.  This one is smooth as silk and located in a great position.  Very nicely designed.

I did make a few changes which required going out and buying a torx screwdriver.  First,I reversed the pocket clip because it came the facing the opposite direction I was used to on my Spyderco knives.  Second, the safety had to go.  I found it slipped to the "on" position on its own so the knife did not open when you expected it to and was hard to disengage quickly.  Not because it was difficult to operate, rather it is tiny and hard to find blind.  If you like the safety though, it definitely does  prevent the blade from opening accidentally.

Speaking of safety...the knife arrives razor sharp.  I opened my package and promptly sliced a finger badly enough to leave a scar.  The tension that the blade is under requires some force to overcome and gives it a different feel when closing the knife from a regular lockback.  Be sure you fingers are nowhere near the blade.  I am now in the habit of disengaging the lock and closing by pressing the back of the blade against my thigh

This gun is pretty good but im not sure about the power being 300 fps and the battery takes too long to charge.  Although the clip only holds 30 rounds, the gun is deadly accurate and very powerful when charged long enough.  But please do not buy this gun for use as a sniper because the scope is a piece of s---.  I recommend blowing it up.  Anyway to answer that person's question the cocking handle is just for looks.  Now back to my review.  The scope does not have red crosshairs as i've heard people say and the sights are much better although you should tighten the screws.  The foregrip on this gun is awesome as you can fold it up or down and is not too wobbly in the down position.  Overall this is a great gun and I would highly recommend it to any airsoft player and plus it's only $30

(Chair is way to small for him) I love it for myself because when I take my children to the beach it is very easy for me to carry along with all the other beach accessories!! I would recommend it for someone looking for a light weight chair that is easy to bring along places

When I used lighter, less dense mats they would sometimes bunch up or move around during flowing vinyasa practice.  If my toe caught the mat, the edge would flip over and require adjustment.  Also, they did not cushion very well.  In addition, lesser mats wore out quickly and had to be replaced.  When doing poses like the side-arm balance, my foot would slip off the end of the regular length mat and I would fall out of the pose.

With the extra-long manduka mat, none of these issues is a problem.  The mat is solid and dense, and stays put on the floor no matter what I do.  It cushions really well, but because it is so dense it is no problem to balance or move on the mat (not mushy).  I beat the daylights out of these mats and they still look great.  Durability is outstanding, and they show no signs of wearing out.  Ever.  The extra length allows me to move with confidence, knowing I won't run out of room or slip off the mat.  An additional benefit of the long mat is that it allows you to change your starting position on the mat somewhat, so that the small area worn by your feet is not the same every practice.  In other words, you can spread the wear over a larger area to make it last even longer.  The surface is plenty sticky for normal yoga, and if you do a hot yoga class or sweat a lot you will likely want to have a towel anyway.  No complaints about stickiness.

As for weight, it seems that if you are big enough to need an extra-long mat you are probably plenty strong enough to carry it around.  It ain't heavy, it's the best yoga mat I've ever seen.

I've had trouble over the years finding ear plugs that would make a consistent seal against sound.   I've tried various types, including the compressible foam, but nothing seems to work all the time.   I use ear plugs when riding my motorcycle, under my full face helmet.   These plugs work great and are very comfortable.   They're also very easy to remove (not so the compressed foam, if they're just a little too far in).  I've had no problems with the ends touching the inside of the helmet and have since bought several more, including some for my riding buddies to try.   My only complaint is that the included case doesn't hold up to repeated use - the "hinge" just doesn't last - but the plugs have held up nicely for a couple of months now.

i have to say that i LOVE this mat. the combo jute and rubber make it nearly impossible to slip. only thing is... the jute and rubber are rubbing up against one another and kind of crumbling and flaking off where i often place my feet causing bald spots on my mat. haha. weird, huh? so now you know. other than that the mat is visually very pleasing

I had concerns when I ordered this machine. Like the fact that I am so short. I didn't know if it would be designed for taller people. It worked fine for my height as well as my husbands height. (I am 5') I also had concerns because I have arthritis but I was able to do this without causing flare ups all the time and I am able to set goals and get a decent workout. I am able to adjust the machine to more difficult tensions so this is something that will last a very long time for me. The only drawback that I have found with this machine is that it hurts the toes a bit. Mine are starting to get use to it a bit. This machine is worth the money. I would highly recommend it to anyone especially those suffering with bone disease such as I am. It is a wonderful way to get healthier without compromising on pain

I purchased my Leki Nordic Walking Poles because I read somewhere that these poles would reduce stress on my hips and knees while walking.  That is totally true!  I have a congenital malformation in my right hip which prevents me from ever being able to run or jog as a means for exercise.  I do love to walk, but was hindered by the pain from my right hip.  By using the walking poles, I am able to walk quickly without any pain at all, even though I am actually using more muscle groups than I would if walking without the use of poles.  Walking alone, a person only uses about 50% of the large muscle groups.  Walking with LEKI Nordic Walking poles, one will use up to 90% of all the large muscle groups; this turns a simple 30 minute walk into a full-body workout without stress!!  I would not walk any other way now that I own my LEKI poles!

I own an older version of this net. It is about 10 years old and has been used once/week every summer.  It was used in a high level volleyball league, but it would be great for recreational use as well.  I paid $200 for the net and it is still like new.  I can't believe this is selling for $69.

I got a pair of these boots for Christmas and even though I'm not sure what all they can be used for, they are great!  The construction is top-notch, they're  easy to use, comfortable, etc.  I seen cheaper boots on the market, but when I'm buying a product to let me hang upside down a few feet above the concrete/tile floor in my house, I want the best product for the job.  ;

This is a better stroller than the other three (all for one child) strollers we have. Very maneuverable and adjustable. It turns on a dime and seats adjust up and down independently. Folds down very quickly. It's great that the kids can sit next to each other.

I bought it through the Target -Amazon store, which was cheaper than the same product through other vendors. Its very easy to assemble although you may want to play with the chain a bit to set up the desired tension (by shortening the chain to belt connection which can get chain grease on you a bit).
To me it was exactly as advertised, a long rowing machine that is not too quite but far less loud than expected and works well. I do not fold it away after use but its a nice feature if you want to move it to another part of the house and dont want to lug an 8 foot long device

We have used more expensive "professional" grade ergometers that would have cost at least three times as much and we are very pleased with how the Integrity compares for a home version.  Assembly and operation are easy, the equipment seems well built and the noisy breeze generated by the wind resistance wheel is very tolerable, allowing conversation or TV viewing with only moderate volume increases

Highly recommended!!!! My wife uses this pack for nursing school.  As you can imagine she carries A LOT OF "STUFF".  This pack makes it a lot lighter on the shoulders than a normal pack would because of the padding in the straps.  I would recommend this to anyone who is a student and is looking for a durable pack for school

Pros: 
1.great compartmentalization everything is easy to obtain (if you know where to put it). 
2.Lots of room able to put just about everything in it. gym clothes, several text books, laptop, camping gear, etc. 

Cons: 
1.its bulky, even when nothing is in it, its bulky. if your one who likes to show off your back or want a sense of style this is not the product for you. Tip: to make less bulky, put more stuff in bigger compartments relative to smaller compartment.

2. THe shoulder strap strain resistant doesn't quite work...i'm consider myself an average male, strain works in about 25lbs. if you want less strain i'd go for the Targus or Wenger brands.

Conclusion: if all you want is lots of space to put ur stuff w/o the style involved this product is for you

I love my Jansport Odyssey backpack. It has a lot of room and the straps are much more comfortable than any other backpack I have ever owned or tried.  I have a lot of very heavy books and this backpack can't be beaten for tranporting books.  A little more padding in the straps (or smaller textbooks)would make it perfect, but it is still better than anything I have seen out there.  I would highly recommend it to any high school or college student

 I thought the DVD was excellent from the standpoint of a person not having much experience in lifting or exercising.  It shows great technique and form.  I used to be a wrestler in the highly competitive state of Iowa so over the years I learned many of these pushup and workout techniques.  Pushups and dumbbells used to be my main source of lifting and staying in shape.   I found myself to be too advanced for the Power 10 workout  so the video seemed like common knowledge.  So for beginners and more advanced people looking for a great DVD focusing on developing proper form and technique this is an excellent DVD .  The DVD takes you through many different styles of pushups showing the proper form and setup.  It then does about a set of three of that style pushup to show you the routine in live workout motion.  With the DVD purchase I was hoping to find an exercise program, approximately 30-45 minutes long, that sets up a nice workout routine for people short on time.  I was hoping for a video that combines a variety of different pushups using the Perfect Pushup into a nice timed workout.  A workout that works my chest, back, arms, abs, and some cardio into a nice overall workout that is done in short time.    Something similar to a Tae Bo style video or other timed exercise videos.  The Power 10 Workout isn't that type of video.  It is more specifically a technique video that one can evntually combined into a workout of their own.  I recently wrote some emails to the Body Rev president suggesting the development of a video for more advanced people that provides a fast, effective workout routine that one could get at the gym, but can do at home in 30-45 minutes with their Perfect Pushup.  He seemed pretty impressed by the idea so hopefully BodyRev builds on this DVD like they have for their other products.

As a man with nearly flat feet, this product has saved my legs.  While the quality and durability of this orthotic are similar to others in its class, what seperates it that SOF SOLE's CUSTOMER SERVICE IS OUTSTANDING and THE WARRANTY holds true.  When they wear out within a year, simply send them back and you'll get a new pair.  You'll be purchasing several pair, feel great and wonder why you didn' do it sooner.  I've owned Sof Sole insoles for 7 years and I'll have them for 7 more.

GREAT alternative to sugar. The FDA clearly doesn't care if we become diabetic, so we have to care for ourselves. This is a good part of God's creation being used for its designed purpose. Plus, the company was quick to get it to me and it arrived as promised. Great experience. I will buy again

The fat Mouth clamp-ons were easy to install and withheld a 15 hour trip from Texas to Colorado and back again. They came off my luggage rack very quickly and when when we are ready to use it again, will be quickly put back on. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an attachment for ski rack to thier factory installed luggage rack.

This product isn't a miracle product, but it does do a few things: it supports your back, it is comfortable, it does make you sweat (mostly on your waistline) and therefore does make you lose some inches and also detoxes you a little bit.   It's not a bad product overall, but don't expect a miracle... you have to do the work for this product to help you at all.  I do use it any time I'm doing an aerobic workout to enhance overall affects

My daughter just entered 9th grade and joined the tennis team. I have played badminton for years and tennis is a fun sport and about the only sport I will do with her other than walking or biking. I bought her this racquet because I wanted something easy for her, not too heavy, and reliable. The salesperson at Dick's Sporting Goods recommeded this one and I am happy to say that it has been great! She has been able to hit the ball and with some practice I can see her becoming more confident. In fact, the other girls on her team are always asking if they can play with her racquet! I have been doing alot of reading and the racquet really does make a difference; one piece is better and this is a titanium racquet. This racquet has great shock absorption; I have rheumatoid arthritis and will not play with a racquet that is going to leave me in pain. I liked this racquet so much that I just bought a second one so my daughter and I can play with the same racquet. P.S....it comes in a nice case...and the Wilson US Open Tennis Balls are an excellent choice for a match

We have purchased 3 of these tricycles in the past 2 years for our grandsons; 1 was a gift, but the other 2 are kept at our home as I watch the boys daily. The boys, ages 20 months and 3 yrs, love to ride them with the streamers flying and the bell ringing. I love them because of the way they are built. The center of gravity is set very low to the ground, making spills and tip-overs a thing of the past. The rubber wheels have a better grip than the plastic wheels of other brands too. (I had purchased a small plastic trike and the way the wheels would just spin in place was very frustrating to the boys.) The old-fashioned fenders on the wheels help keep little fingers from getting hurt and the wide step in the back seems to be useful when getting on or off. All in all, a great trike

Ok so I read a horrific review but that sounds like a lemon of a stove. Our stove is great! We took it out for a trial run with 12 or so friends and what do know it performed flawlessly. The ignition was quick the cook temp was even and we had our coffee before many others using their Colemans. In fact several friends couldn't believe the heat this little guy produced. We love this little stove and will be using it for many years to come

I've been carrying and using these Swiss Army Spartans (or similar model) for about 35 years.  Bought my first in Germany and couldn't get along without it now.  Great quality and has just about everything you could want for daily use.  It's small enough and light enough that it's comfortable to carry.  Doesn't have all the useless "bell and whistles" that you'd probably only use if you were a 12 year-old Boy Scout.  Only problem (mine, not the knife's) is that I tend to lose one about every 6-7 years... so I bought 2 this time so as to have a replacement for the next time it grows legs and walks away.  Another great feature is the optional eyeglass screwdriver than can be purchased and fits neatly (via a threaded handle) into the corkscrew

Gotta say I LOVE this Step and even more so the DEAL: Not only do you get The Step, but you also get FOUR raising-blocks *AND* a Step-workout dvd -- All for under $50!!! I think that's a bargain compared to buying the pro-equipment (I think it was $70-80 for the pro Step and $40-50 for two raising blocks, plus $15 for a DVD... that's, like, $140-150!).

The Step *is* smaller than the Steps you're probably used to from the gym, BUT it's not *that* much smaller -- I would say it's about 25% shorter length-wise.  It's gotta be though, I mean it's an at-home Step so they're making it more storable.  I guess if you're a big person it might be a little frustrating at first, but I don't see how you couldn't adjust to it.  Then again, I'm 5'2 & petite so for me it's the perfect size! haha :P

The DVD is pretty good.  It's pretty simple, basic stepping though, so if you're an advanced stepper you'll probably get bored real fast.  However, it does get you to sweat a little, so it's not a complete waste.  If not for the stepping, though, keep it for the abs workout -- OMG it's AMAZING!! For only 10 minutes it really makes you want to commit stomach suicide. haha  Which is a good thing because the next day your tummy is sore but FLAT. :)  But really, it's a good DVD, especially for those lazy days that you know you need to workout but don't want to (at least not too hard). LOL

Buy this kit, it's a *great* deal and it'll get you in shape! :

*****
This is an upscale designer water bottle, top of the line, and so much fun. The designs Of Sigg's water bottles are gorgeous, from the plain, solid color bottles, to the ones with intricate designs. They are simply beautiful! I switched from regular plastic water bottles because of health concerns, thinking it would take more work to maintain. These do necessitate regular cleaning (I clean mine every day), but having something so beautiful to drink from makes the cleaning fun. Sort of like my rings, glasses, and watch, I now consider my Sigg personal water bottle a vital accessory, reminding me to drink more water, making a statement about my values, and expressing myself with a special design. Yes, all in a water bottle!

Sigg of Switzerland water bottles are very high quality, made of light aluminum on the outside, slightly insulated, and covered with a special powder coat on the inside that prevents any leaching whatsoever, unlike plastic and polycarbonate water bottles. They are light, durable, and perfect for any activity. Well water tastes spectacular in these bottles, just like from the tap.

Sigg bottles come with several different types of tops. I bought the screw top because I don't like sports tops, and I don't mind unscrewing the top when I want a drink. It is totally leakproof, which is important to me. The top is pretty and can be hooked onto a carabiner. I get comments on it all the time, "What's that? I love it!" The sports top version is ok; I just am not a fan, as I don't feel like I can get enough water from the little stream from the sports top. However, for convenience, you might prefer it. For children, there is a cap-type top. All are leak-proof. If you are ever unsatisfied with the top, you can buy a screw top separately to fit your Sigg bottle.

Sigg makes their personal water bottle in .6L and 1L in this style. I have both. I use the .6L for sports activities because they are smaller. When I won't have to carry the container, I like the larger bottle. Sigg also makes a smaller .3L bottle for children that is a perfect size for young people. You can buy Siggs in alternative sizes too, such as .75L, .4L (for kids), .6L, .5L. You can occasionally find this bottle in the 1.5L size, also. Search Amazon for the perfect size.

Pick a style and pattern you like, as this bottle is a personal accessory, and should reflect your style. The colors are vibrant and even prettier than they seem in the pictures on Amazon.

They are expensive, but they are so durable that you can plan on them lasting many years. I consider them both an accessory and an investment in my health, so they are well worth it value-wise for me.

Highly recommended.

LED headlights are getting better all the time. This little guy is a one Watt Luxeon LED with very good power regulation. Regulation means that the light gets the most from a set of batteries and keeps the light at a given brightness instead of dimming as the batteries weaken. The Princeton Tec EOS has three brightness settings and a flash mode. I actually find the flash mode to be too slow to be useful on the bike and it flashes at full power but these are minor nits. I'd also prefer if the light used AA instead of AAA cells. So I guess there are two things I don't like about this light.

But the positives far outweigh the negatives. The light is small and is supposed to be waterproof to one meter. (I don't ride under water so I haven't tested that feature!) It's easy to operate and the batteries are easy to change. The light pattern seems to be just right for my riding. I use this light on my helmet but it also comes with a handlebar mount. I run the light at the lowest power setting most of the time and that's fine for reading my bike computer or cue sheets. The middle setting is better for general riding, spotting road signs and potholes and things like that. At the highest setting, you get the brightest beam but of course that eats through the batteries quicker.

I'm pretty sure the circuit in this light was designed by Willie Hunt, a real guru in bike lighting circles. And yes, I'm enough of a nerd that I actually keep track of things like that. Anyhow, the Princeton Tec EOS is my latest favorite bike toy

We bought this bicycle for our son's 3rd birthday.  He LOVED the bright colors and the fact that it has somewhere for his horses to ride!  It has taken a little while for him to get used to the training wheels, but the bike stays steady while he is riding and doesn't threaten to tip.  We are very happy with this bicycle

This - along with a pogo stick and stilts - was my effort to get my kids offf the video games at least some of the time! I thought this might be too hard for the 6 year old, but he persisted and is getting better at it. The point is, it's so fun he keeps trying! The 13 yr old - and my 17 year old daughter are enjoying it too. There seems to be a trade-off between the stilts and the hit-a-way. Only the little guy can handle the pogo stick - go figure

   The suit itself is great, but the sizing is just way off.  I purchased 
   a large and an extra large for my kids; the large is actually too big
   for me, and the extra large is enormous.  It is almost as though they 
   are sized for men instead of youth.  Hopefully they'll grow into
   them . . .

Very useful stopwatch.  I like the mutiple functions. My use is for swim workouts.  This watch allows me to have three intervals going at once.   The print is a little smaller than it appears on the picture.  Not a real problem.  I am glad I bought this stopwatch over my other choice which could only time two lanes.

Despite having some trepidation after reading the reviews of owners who had unpleasant experiences with the SG4, I bought it and am glad that I did.  My experiences using the SG4 during play have been very positive, even though on occasion the weather conditions have been so bad that I could only get a signal for some of the holes.  The large screen allows the user to easily see each of the obstacles on a given hole and know the distance to them and the distance required to carry them.  The SG4 also provides a more detailed view of each obstacle as well as the distances to the front edge, center, and rear edge of each green.  For golfers who like to know the exact distance they hit each of their clubs, the "MARK" feature is marvelous.  Being able to have all of this valuable information available for 10 professionally measured courses and 5 personally measured courses is of significant value for golfers who play a number of different courses not only on a regular basis but also for courses being played for the first time.  The SG4 also has a memory card slot for being able to download more courses when that service is offered in the future. I think the the downloading procedures on the SKY GOLF web site are somewhat confusing but not very difficult to figure out and use with only a few minutes of effort.  I know several low and mid-handicappers who LOVE this device, and I share their enthusiasm and opinion -- I am a high handicapper.  I also own a Bushnell Pinseeker 1500 with slope and consider the SG4 to be a far superior "tool" to the Bushnell. NOTE: there is at least one additional cost that buyers will incur after they receive their Sky Caddie -- the subscriber fee for downloading courses for 1 year.  The fees range from $30 for courses measured in one state that you designate to $80 for worldwide use

Looks great, functions great.  Manual is a little daunting and a couple of the words on the display are very small.  I have 20/20 vision and I can't always read everything that is being displayed.  It is mostly in the Alt and Barometer functions where there is lots of info being shown.  

Highly recomended

For those who may be new to Suunto, they are wrist-top computers designed and manufactured in Finland and are in use all over the world by Hikers, Bikers and outdoor enthusiasts of all kinds.  What makes the X-Lander stand out are at first glance, obviously its sheer size.  Let there be NO illusions, the X-Lander is a mighty big watch.  Despite its size, it doesn't FEEL as big as it looks, though.  The aluminum case is VERY light and quite comfortable, too.  The next thing you notice would be the HUGE amount of bells and whistles packed into such a small device.

#1. An accurate altimeter.  This is an invaluable tool for the avid hiker and biker.  One thing you MUST be ready to do is remember to adjust it DAILY.  Find out what the altitude is and set the watch before you begin your trip, and then at the end of the day you need to make note of where you stopped (which you can do with the internal recording function) and properly adjust it before setting out the next day.  This is NOT a flaw, every single altimeter watch I am aware of is exactly the same.

#2. Barometer.  I found it correct at least 75% of the time, which is more than I can say for the local TV Weatherman.  This includes a thermometer as well, which in order to be accurate must be removed from your wrist for at least 15 minutes in order not to get a false reading due to lingering body heat.

#3. Digital Compass.  This is truly one amazing feature, by the way.  Once you calibrate it (which you may need to do weekly) you will NEVER be lost -- especially if you know how to use a map.

#4. It tells pretty accurate time, too believe it or not.  It also comes with an alarm, a countdown AND a stopwatch.  Suddenly its size now makes sense, huh?  

I happen to LIKE big watches.  I don't exactly know why, but I just do.  IF I were to have ANY complaint whatsoever, the one thing this watch is lacking is exactly what they have included in the much less expensive Vector: A tiny little bubble which helps you to level out the watch in the compass mode for a more precise reading.  The reason why may have to do with the fact that the X-Lander is mineral crystal and the Vector is plastic, but either way, it'd be nice to have.  I am VERY impressed with just about everything associated with Suunto and their fantastic line of what they call, Wristop Computers.  IF size really DOES matter to you, well you may wish to go with the Observer or maybe the X6HR (which does everything the X-Lander and Observer can do PLUS it has a built-in heart-rate-monitor) both are smaller than the X-Lander, Vector, Yachtsman and many other Suunto models yet still offers a LOT -- but keep in mind with the smaller size comes the bigger price.  Factor all that into your purchase plans and once again, if at ALL possible, do NOT buy until you have the chance to see some of these (or any) models IN PERSON.  That will make a HUGE difference in how happy your purchase will end up being...and good luck!

I recently got into gymnastics so I started looking for a leotard for someone with real curves. I'm 5'6'' and 180lbs and the XL fits me great. It has long sleeves which is great for the wintertime and I don't have to feel self consciousness about my fat hanging out there because it covers it up. It's cut low enough so that I'm not getting wedgies and I can do handstands without worrying if my workout shirt got un-tucked. It's not flashy so I don't look like a 10 year old in a fat 26 year olds body. It's nice and plain, gets the job done and I'm sure the others at they gym thank me for covering up for goodness sakes

I ordered this bike on Monday and it was delivered on Thursday! The pictures of this bike don't begin to do it justice. It has a solid metal tube construction and a big padded seat. I am 5'9" and this beauty adjusted perfectly. It is very stable and whisper quiet. I was a bit skeptical when I ordered it but what a bargain!!

I bought this bike for my boyfriend for Christmas. It arrived in about 3 days, rather than the expected 5-7. We set it up on about half an hour. It comes with a small wrench that is perfect for the set up--I read an other review (prehaps on a different bike) that you need a cresent wrench, however for this bike you don't.
He uses it every night, and I use it a few times a week. It's silent and nothing has broken on it as of yet...granted I've only had it for a month.
I would definitely recommend this product

I knew I wanted a bowflex and couldn't decide between the models available.  This model offers the most range in exercises and still has the ability to fold up small enough to be able to set up a double air mattress in my "spare/exercise" room for a weekend guest. 
This product came in several large boxes and is best assembled by a two person team (A husband/wife team worked for us). 
This is the first exercise equipment I have been consistent with.  It is fun to use and takes no effort to change between sets.  I also have the Ab attachment.  Love it

Working out used to be heh for me, but after getting the door gym I made a rule. Anytime I enter my bathroom (which is where it is suspended) either before or after I have to do 10 Pull-ups and 10 Neutral pull-ups, also since I purchased the broad-reach 10 of those as well. It's working wonders, within the first week of doing pull-ups where i'd use my legs just enough to complete the pull-up I'm now able to do 10 regular pull-ups. I'm very happy with this product, only downside (which I personally don't really care about) is that depending on what kind of door frame you have you could get some denting on the front side, the backside works just fine and leaves no marks on your walls. So anyway... I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a quick and depending on how hard you want to work :P easy workout

i got this gun for christmas, and i just got the m14 sniper from pyramyd air. this gun is a very good beginners gun, and a great backup in an airsoft war. im a sniper/backup man, and this is my backup, i am very happy with the performance of this gun.

pros-
has a decent rate of fire
electric so it doesnt have to be cocked for each shot
comes with 8000 bbs (great deal)
collapsible stock

cons-
small but manegeable magazine
accesories are sketchy,  laser broke 
t handle is very loose but helps stability
accuracy on semi auto is ok not good not bad 

if ur looking for a decent beginners gun, or backup like me, than i highly recommend this gu

I am so glad I finally found an online source for these visors.  I've been picking them up, one or two at a time, from street fairs for probably 20 years now.  You can see me wearing them in all my adult travel photos, because they are so light and comfortable, and they keep the sun out of your eyes (or the rain).  And these particular visors, here on Amazon, had good snaps, too

After reading the horror stories of the assembly process/instructions I was a little worried.
Myself and my 12 yr old daughter put it together in about 3 hrs without issue. All parts were included, instructions were clear, she did the step check off's 
The base took 400lbs of sand vs the 375lbs stated in the instruction

After reading the previous reviews and noticed the bad comments about the instructions, I took that into considerations and purchased it anyways.
Nobody was really talkin bad about the board.

Most of us have the urgency of putting it together w/out reading the instructions and simply just looking at the drawings. You have to approach this one differently.

I went ahead and borrowed a friend of mine and paid him with cold beverages because I defintely agree that you need at least 2 people to put this together.

The Instructions although not as detailed did mention that you MUST READ THE ENTIRE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY to assemble this item, failure to do so can delay your assembly because you have to disassemble and re-assemble again.

Finally, it took us 4 1/2 hrs to complete the assembly and based on my experience, it wasn't that bad at all. I only wish they added spare washers/nuts just in case you lose it.

Once its installed, I added water to it and let me tell you. Its supposed to be portable but w/ the base filled, its pretty heavy.

The board has a better rebound than other cheap boards out there but its not like the ones at the indoor gym. 50" is adequate for a home use, but you better have the apace for this. The base takes alot of room.

The ability to move the height up/down is as advertised. I can do it with one hand. Very nice!!!
I measured it from the rim to the floor and its accurate based on the height you adjusted to.

One thing I found out just now. This "slam-it" rim, you are not allowed to hang on it or it will cause you your warranty. I know because Lifetime answered my question I emailed out.
They do not have weight limits on these rims so do not attempt to hang on it. 

I defenitely recommend this if your shopping for one.

I really like this mat by Hugger Mugger. The thickness is really nice especially if practicing on hardwood or tile floor. I actually purchased mine at TJ Maxx for $10 buck less than the selling price here. The color selection is very nice too. My one complaint is that I had to wash it several times to rid the mat of a chemical odor. I recommend using an organic soap or spray whenever washing a yoga mat. This one in my experience, needs to be washed & completely dried several times for it to have a fresh scent. All in all I say this is a fine product. However, the very best mat imho are Ecomats which are made from jute plant. Much more expensive than this one but well worth the price

Although my wife disagreed - I bought this for my son's 6 year old birthday.  It took him a day to figure it out well enough to jump on it from a stand still and get going a hundred yards or so.  

Materials look reasonably good, it's light enough that he can cary it, and stout enough that I (dad) can also enjoy a fun ride.  I must say this is one of the coolest toys invented.  Easily 5 stars

I'm 26 and I'm having a blast on this board! It's much more accessible than snowboarding and surfing, because you can just grab your board and go!

I take mine to a local tennis court for the smooth surface. They recommend using small hills and stuff, but honestly stopping or slowing down is pretty much impossible on a decent incline, so I prefer to stay on flat land. Its amazing how long you can stay on the board without even setting a foot on the ground! The board seems to be constructed fairly well. I've gotten to the point where I can some pretty advanced turns by shifting my weight effectively, its really fun trying to master it. 

I'm curious if the Ripstik (competitor board) is better constructed since its made by Razor, and they might have put more money into the design. Anyways, I've had mine for about 2 months, and the wheels are definately showing a lot of wear. I'll most likely have to replace them soon. I'm kinda happy that you can use any rollerblade wheels instead of some proprietary wheels. That enables you to look for good deals on some wheels. 

I'd also look around for the best deals on these boards. I got mine at a Sports Authority on sale for $80, after having seen one at an FAO on my visit to Las Vegas for $130.

So, if you're a fun-loving adult who likes cool new ways of moving along,  I'd definately recommend this! It's addicting

Love this backpack, it's been with me to numerous cities and countries and survives the trips very well, while protecting the contents well, laptop included.  The outside large pocket is larger than you think when you realize just how much stuff you can fit in there, and still fit under an airplane seat.  Love the two water holders on the outside. Love the zippers are a loop so you can attach a carabiner, compass, or whatever. The support is great, you'll barely feel its there, and if you do, just use both straps, and then strap the front for great support. The pen storage area could be larger to accommodate larger pens, but thats quite minor.

My only con is that the outside two pockets have gotten stuck twice already. I am now on my third backpack(gotta LOVE REI's return policy). Hopefully this one will last as I have yet to find a better more complete backpack.  
Update 1/30/2007 - Third backpack , third zipper to get caught, time to return, again. I wish I could change the scale down to 2 stars :

For the price and relative ease of use, this is a decent starter net.  The five foot height/width makes it a little small for older youth.  It is easy to fold, carry and store, which is a huge plus - especially compared to other so-called portable nets.  It deploys fairly easily enough, though the support pole set-up is not completely intuitive.  The set I puchased had no instructions, so it wasn't until after several uses that I completely figured it out. All in all, however, I am pleased with it and would buy another should the need arise

I am very happy with my choice. It is just the right size, nicely finished with glossy black paint, installs in a minute. Usage is very convenient: it has that perfect click-into-place property: you push down on it with your forefoot and it snaps into the "stand" position. To "hide" it when you are ready to go, just hit back with your heel or simply start pedalling and it snaps back along the frame. It does the job perfectly and it feels great

I've never been a fan of propane stoves. They always seemed flimsy, made for those toy-sized backpacking pots and pans and potentially dangerous - until now. After two weeks of RV-ing, the Fold 'N Go has become a welcome addition to our set up. 

It is very sturdy and seems extremely well made. The wide separation of the two burners and heavy-duty pot supports allow for two large, heavy fry pans and/or stock pots at one time. Few stoves of any kind can handle simultaneous large pots. And it seems very stable when set on a table.

And because it folds in half and becomes its own carry-case, even though it handles such large tasks, it's easy to carry and takes up very little storage space. It also has an instant start feature - you just turn the nob and then press a button and that's it. You're ready to cook. 

And after you're done, clean up is a snap. Unlike other stoves where you have to take them all apart to try and get at that nasty, spattered grease, this one is pretty much all sealed - just take the pot supports off, wipe off underneath, flip the pot supports over to store inside and then Fold 'N Go!

It's great to get cooking moved outside the RV - especially for things like frying bacon or cooking anything that gives off a lot of steam. And because our meals seem to entail usually one or the other, we plan on getting an extension hose off our main propane tank to run this frequently in the future.

I was spending the day at home with a cold.  The doorbell rang.  At my doorstep, was a large box.

"Already? I just ordered it a few days ago." 

I shrugged on a jumper and hauled the surprisingly light (it's only 52 pounds) box up the stairs.  A sharp knife, a pair of nail clippers, thirty minutes and several small drifts of white packing material snow later, I had my Extreme Pilates put together.

On first impressions, the mat graphic is cheesy, and the frame looks flimsy.  However, this isn't just a Pilates trap table:  the leg spring hooks are placed further back than they are on studio quality equipment, and are less likely to get in the user's way.  The push through bar won't drop if you let go of it, because the metal is engineered not to slide.  There are warning stickers to use the safety strap on the push through bar. Overall, this is a safer machine than the original.

When you try to use it, though, there are a few problems:  I'm 5'4" and the mat is too short if you want to roll down to the floor.  The springs are light, and I would suspect that replacing them with heavier ones might overload the strength of the frame.  It's not clear which springs are the leg springs.  The lack of clips is just silly.

That said, I can do everything I can do on a trap table.  I did the cat, swan and saw with the push through bar, leg circles with the springs, chest expansion and roll down with the bar, and even the magician's series to finish.  

That kink in my shoulder that only goes away with the push through bar started to work itself out.  I could hear the springs (real springs, not bungee cords!)  All was (briefly) right with the world.  This is an amazing piece of equipment for the price.
 
Three caveats:  Not for taller men; it's just too small.  Not for serious athletes; not enough resistance.  Not for people with children if you can't lock it away; springs are not safe for the little ones to play with.

I have had many backpacks for school and am always left wanting more space.  I like to have different places to put different materials.  This gives me the opportunity to do so.  I like the fact that I can put my Ipod in a section that is not likely to recieve the weight of the many books I use.  I would say that the area where you hold the smaller items, such as pens and calculators, is nice.  You have dividers where you can hold many different things.  Overall, this is the best pack for school I have come across

I love my Jansport Odyssey backpack. It has a lot of room and the straps are much more comfortable than any other backpack I have ever owned or tried.  I have a lot of very heavy books and this backpack can't be beaten for tranporting books.  A little more padding in the straps (or smaller textbooks)would make it perfect, but it is still better than anything I have seen out there.  I would highly recommend it to any high school or college student

My kids got these from Grandpa.  They love them!  They're fun to bowl with in a dark room.  We've clipped them onto headboards for a decent-sized reading light.

The problems: The clip is pretty hard to operate, even for an adult.  Also, the plastic base broke on each of our lights (in different places), so now they're clip-less.  They're still well-loved and well-used by the little guys, though.  

I recommend these lights, but be careful w/ the bases

With the birth of our first child, there were tons of little toys lying around all the time, from teethers to rattles, stuffed lovies and blocks.  The traditional toy box was too bulky for our small living space, so when someone gave us this adorable tote we were thrilled to see how much fit inside, how sturdy it was, and how much our baby loved looking at it!   With bold primary colors and cute scenes surrounding the entire bin, there is even a fold out flap with a play space, and a singing bird which attaches to the side basket.  The fun roof is all made of satin ribbons that resemble "shingles."  This was easily stored in our closet or taken along on trips.   Best of all, there seems to be no end to how much you can stuff inside!  It is soft and collapsible, yet stands upright and will hold just about all your small baby toys.  It can be VERY GENTLY machine washed, but we discovered it was best not to throw it in with anything heavy.  I gave one to a neighbor when her son was born and she still raves about how perfect it was for their baby's toys.  I give this 5 stars without hesitation; affordable and totally functional

We have had the 438 for over a year and it has been outstanding.  I started using an elliptical at the gym and still do but the convenience of having this at home is perfect.  Construction is top notch and the workout is oh so quiet.

The workout monitor keeps track of every workout by user and has such features as fitness test, recovery and many workout profiles to keep you  challenged.

What started out as a purchase for my use is now also used by my wife and daughter.  I guess they had to try it after I continued to rave about it.

Time flies while you are on the 438.  Best of all this unit actually gets used.

If you are going to buy one piece of home exercise equipment... look no further.

I've owned three pairs of these so far, and they're easily the best gloves I've ever used.  I had previously only used unpadded gloves, and the padding in the palm seemed a little thick at first.  The padding does make it more difficult to get a solid grip in some exercise machines that also have large rubber grips on them (lat pulldown bars, for example), but that's the trade off for excellent support and protection when using the gloves on machines with uncovered metal grips.  

I found these gloves to be more durable than the other non-padded Harbinger gloves I've worn.  The gloves can be safely washed and air dryed, as advertised.

My only complaint with regard to wear is that the unreinforced leather where my thumb meets the padding in the palm seems to wear out before the rest of the glove.  Every pair I have owned will eventually wear a hole in this particular area.

Quick shipping - I received this bike in 4 days (using free super saver shipping) and it was even over a holiday!  The bike comes in one large box with MANY pieces.  My husband and father put the bike together in less than 1 hour.  It looked a little overwhelming at first but was quite easy to assemble.  The bike is very compact and easily placed in small areas.  It is also very quiet - you have to listen closely to even hear the bike.

The resistance goes from 1 to 8 (one being the easiest to eight being the hardest).  My husband is an avid road biker and 8 could be too easy for someone looking for a really hard ride (like riding the equivalent of up-hill).

The bike offers basic functions that are displayed very large.  The display is easily toggled through.  The heart rate monitor picks up okay, but don't buy the bike based off of that function because it's not totally reliable.

All in all, a great buy!  I injured my back and was looking for a workout that would be good on my back.  The seat is uncomfortable (and I am petite- I would imagine it would be very uncomfortable if someone was larger.  But for the price, you can't beat it

Perfect, exactly what I expected and wanted. I ride to work in rain or shine or storm and was sick of the water shooting up, had it on in less then 5 min. My bike is full suspension, 26 inch wheels with that horse shoe (U) bar on the lower legs of the front fork and it still fit with no problem. Don't know how it would handle a crash in trees though, sits high like a dirt bike look. People ask where I got it

The science is sound, but check it out yourself.  

Police, military, etc., are using it, Fortune 100, other governmental agencies.  Schools should use it, if they don't.  It puts the kids into their best possible learning state.

Seriously, 5 stars is not justice.  50,000 stars.  50,000 is the number of neurons directing your brain when you are in the zone.  The power the brain when "coherent" or not is tangible, and it's driven by the heart.  

You can sense it in a person, anger, happiness, whatever.  It's the healing state.  It's the creative state.  It's where hormones balance.

Compass worked wonderfully for my trip around New England this summer. Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is for want of a backlight for night driving. Remember to moisten the suction cups before adhering to the window. I forgot the first time and it popped off 10 minutes later. Never came off again the whole trip after I moistened them.  Worth the money.

This gun is awesome! It shoots hard and fast. The battery pack was a little hard to get on at first, but it works.  Don't fire them in the house.  They put dents in the doors and blinds [they shoot really hard].  They bounce off the basement walls and really hurt, so go outside.  

I did a battle with my dad and brother, and it lasted 2 hours.  It was great!  Now my dad wants one of his own

Sometimes this unit works flawlessly, other times it seems to have trouble picking up the signal.  I am not sure if that is a problem with this USB device, the Polar HRM, or the way that I am holding it.  In any event, most of the time it works and the data transfers quickly.

This is one of the BEST weightlifting gloves that I have found so far!!  I like it so much, that I've bought a few pairs.  These have very supportive wrist wraps that are adjustable to secure your wrist during lifting - to help prevent injury.  The rest of the glove is terrific.  It is thicker around the palm and fingers, so it provides EXCELLENT cushioning for those heavy lifts. I have not had  one blister, or redness since I've started using these gloves, and I've been using them for over a year now.  They are extremely comfortable. After a year of use, my gloves are still in perfect condition too.  I've tried other brands, and the others tend to have thinner material around the palm and fingers,  and this causes redness and blisters, so what's the use of using them?  On the other hand, this Valeo Ocelot Wrist Wrap Weightlifting glove is perfect in every way!!  Has support, comfort, and it looks great. I have the orange pair (GLOW), and I get lots of compliments at the gym too about how great they look. Well worth every penny.  Way to go Valeo!

I have used this product now as a self supported bicycle rider for two years.  I am pleased with the product.  It's not real soft and fluffy like a thick towel but does a great job in absorbing water after a shower or stream bath and dries fast.  It's as practical as can be for what I got it for!  It also is very compact and light in the pack.  The one piece of advice I have is to not get a smaller version but go with the larger size.  The additional weight and bulk in nothing and having the additional towel surface is worth it

My wife and I put this thing together in about an hour.  There was one cracked foot tread, but after calling Schwinn, we had a replacement within two days and no hassles.  If you are looking for a decent machine at a great price, this is a nice one.  It is fairly sturdy and has some nice preprogrammed workouts

We had in mind the type of exercise bikes we wanted.  We investigated several brands, models, and vendors.  The Schwinn 212 appeared to be the best value.  And, given the free shipping, Amazon had the best price.  So we ordered.  We were not in any way dissappointed.  Assembly was reasonably easy.  And the bikes are working out well for us

The Schwinn Airdyne is built to last out of steel. For upper and lower body workout, it uses a fan/flywheel to create resistance rather than a friction belt or magnetic motor; hint--fewer repairs and failures since there is no friction mechanism to fail.

The onboard computer allows your to select what information you wish to see such as mets, calories, distance, speed, rpm and even displays your pulse if you wear a chest strap.  You can select miles or kilometers for distance and "club or home" for setup; hint--built to withstand use in a fitness center/health club. It even allows you to imput your geological elevation to facilitate a more accurate calorie count.

Assembly is straight foward but does require a few basic tools such an adjustable wrench and phillips screwdriver.

This represents a good way to go if you want a well built durable piece of equipment intended for serious use to achieve your goal of cardio-vascular conditioning, weight loss or just plain old exercise

I like this knife very much; it's size, shape, fit in the hand, and pocket clip are all just what I wanted. It has a nice edge and the Speed Safe assisted opening feature is fantastic. My only complaint is that the safety is placed in such a way that makes one-handed opening difficult with the safety engaged. I want the safety engaged because the assisted opening is so easy to activate and I don't want the knife springing open in my pocket. This is only a minor quibble, though. I do enjoy the knife very much; it is a good size to wear with jeans for light duty day-to-day use, which is what most people need a pocket knife for anyway. I use a different, larger knife for heavier duty use

I own several LED flashlights including 3 different ones from C Crane Company. This little unit from Garrity outshines them all.
It is a bright far reaching light and the long battery life is impressive all in a light that fits in the palm of your hand.

If you need just one handy convinient flashlight to carry with you, throw that old 3 cell mag light in the trash and welcome to the new age of flashlights

We have a slightly sloped yard so I was hesitant about getting a trampoline.  We tried it, and it works fine!  My kids love it!  Of course, like any other toy, they take it in spells but it still gets used alot after 6 months.  I was also concerned at first about them falling off of it.  I almost bought the enclosure to go with it but I decided to wait and see how high they jumped, etc.  This trampoline is so small, they really can't get a lot of "air" so they don't do flips and other dangerous tricks.  It's also very low to the ground.  I am glad now that I didn't get the enclosure.  We don't really need it.  I would recommend this trampoline for younger kids.  The weight limit is 120 lbs so it can't support larger kids.  Also, since it is so small, we only let our two preschoolers jump together.  When we have guests over, it's one at a time.  I love it that my kids want to be outside so much.  This is better money spent than on video games, in my opinion

MFG by Northpole LTD, this roomy chair features padded seat and back for additional comfort.  Seating position is leaned back, lacking adjustment for more upright seating.   Fabric appears to be a durable rip stop nylon.  The arms are padded with foam, and I question foam durability over the long haul.  The chair could benefit from the addition of a cup holder.  Chair is rated at 225 pounds, and is close to 4 feet in length when folded and in its carry bag.  NFL team logo is embroidered on front and back of seat back and looks sharp.  Team name and logo is also printed on carry bag.  Overall, a comfortable, well constructed chair (with exceptions as noted) with an eye catching logo of your favorite team

The display didn't work on the first rower we got, and one of the wheels on the front of it was broken.  Amazon sent out a new one the day I reported the problem, and helped me get UPS to pick up the damaged one.  The second rower arrived in good shape, and works fine.  The different programs are nice, it's extremely quiet, and my wife likes it better than the air rower we use at the Y.  The slightly padded seat is also a bonus.  One of the most important features for us was the heart rate monitor.  It comes with the chest strap, and displays heart rate on the LCD screen so you can vary your workout to stay in the target zone.  The heart rate monitor is not available on inexpensive rowers, and with some of the more expensive ones, you still have to buy the chest transducer separately.  Overall, quite satisfied with the rower, and because of their excellent customer service, extrememly satisfied with Amazon

Overall this is a very good rowing machine - quiet, takes up a small amount of space, and easy to use. My only complaint would be the LCD - the first order sent to me had a damaged computer, but Amazon was quick to send out a replacement rower which took care of the problem. Now every thing is great

We were having trouble deciding between this rower and the Kettler Coach.  This one was available thru Amazon, but the Kettler had to be purchased thru Merchantila, which has a horrible reputation.  So, we went with this model.

I couldn't be more pleased.  Where it was manufactured was not listed, so I contacted Lifecore.  I had a response within 24 hrs.  Made in Taiwan, but don't let that put you off.  This is NOT a China quality product.  It's VERY sturdy.  Smooth and silent.  The preset programs vary not only in intensity, but time.  Some are 10 minutes.  Some half an hour.  Haven't tried them all.  Four programs are for you to set.

Ordered it on a Monday.  Here by Friday.  My husband had it set up before I got home from work.  He did complain that the instructions weren't well written.  But he never complained about actually putting it together.  Must not have been too difficult.  All tools were included.

You can also set your workout by time, distance, calories and strokes.

While checking Merchantila's BBB rating, I also checked Lifecore's.  They have NO complaints.  That also helped us decide.

I love this machine.  I'm sorry I didn't get a rower sooner

The Bowflex is one of the most amazing machines I have ever used.  With its range of exercises and a little creativity on your part, you can do just about any exercise you want to do.  I completely recommend this if you don't have the time to go to the gym or if you just really enjoy working out at home.  

One disclaimer, don't think you can get the same results you can get from free weights.  If you are an avid free-weight lifter, you can get your kicks out of maxing the leg press and perhaps even maxing the bench.  The PowerRods have a tension that is proportional to the amount of bend you give them.  Thus, if you do an exercise with 100 pounds of resistance, but only move the power rods through their first half of bend, you aren't getting 100 pounds of resistance.  Also, when you extend the arms of the pulleys to do the wide grip bench, you decrease the amount of bend in the rods to the point where, even if you bend them all the way, you aren't getting full resistance.  

Don't get me wrong, I love this thing; I've had mine for the past 2 years and it is amazing.  I work out twice a day for about 45 minutes to an hour each session, only because I don't have the time to make it to the gym.  Get this if you are very serious about workout out at home and don't have a lot of space to fit other equipment.  Make sure you have a positive attitude going into the lifting programs.  Experiment with ideas on different exercise movements.  More than anything, this piece of equipment is a blast to use, have fun with it

I'm a small person, not a bodybuilder and hated free weights.  However, I realized as I got older that I really needed to do some type of strength training.  I'd been thinking about a Bowflex and after looking at the literature, decided I wanted an Ultimate.  I purchased a used one and don't recommend that route since the seller lost some of the parts and delivered a damaged machine (long story).  I was able to order the missing pieces from Bowflex, but it took forever to get them.  Once I was able to use the machine, I absolutely loved it.  It's especially good for me since I'm usually alone when I work out and was concerned about injury with free weights or other types of exercise/weight machines.  Additionally, due to a neurological problem, I had little extensor function in one hand.  Using the Bowflex, I've been able to rebuild some of the muscle tone and would highly recommend this for anyone who needs physical therapy requiring weights.  I use this faithfully every day, alternating between arm exercises and shoulder exercises.  It's a pleasure to use and not at all tedious.  I think I probably could have done with one model under this since I never use the leg equipment.  Nevertheless, I'd recommend buying this item new from the manufacturer.  It's pricey, but well worth the money

I had one of these years ago and just recently purchased a new one I can say without hesitation that the product really works.  Its great for martial artists, particularly those whose arts rely on grabs, chokes, and need strength in the hands.

These are also good for anyone needing general purpose finger strength, I havn't used one in ages but my friends still say I have some of the strongest hands they've seen and I attribute this entirely to the use of the eagle catcher

I've had my 1 quart Stanley Thermos for over 20 years now, and this is by far, no doubt about it, the best thermos ever invented. I have poured hot coffee in this thermos in the morning prior to doing field work in the dead of winter in upstate NY.  After leaving the thermos literally sitting in the snow in -20 degree temperatures all day, at 5 pm the coffee was still piping hot.

If you need to keep liquids hot, this is the best non-electric product out there for doing it

This very comfortable strap can be put around your wrist or ankle and when you do the exercise, you can just concentrate on the muscle you're working and not have to worry about the theraband slipping.  It's terrific

I bought this on somewhat of a whim because I've been wanting get a little more in shape (got a little bit of pudge going on) and I realized the hardest part of motivating myself to work out was actually getting ready and going out to the gym.. time was somewhat of a factor as well.  So I ordered this a few days ago because I read some reviews on here and it looked like the price was right.  Set it up earlier today; The quality of the parts is basically no worse or better than I'd expected.. think of it as a stripped down eliptical machine.  Setting it up was fairly easy but some of the instructions were a bit unclear.  Threw on some running sneakers and got on, and I've got to say, the feel/motion of this thing is REALLY strange at first.  Unless you are a ballet dancer or gymnist with really good balance, be prepared to look like an idiot on this thing for a little while because, like it's name, it is completely freestyle.  It's range of motion and rhythm is ALL up to you.  Have you ever been on a ski lift at a mountain and had the urge to swing your skis forward and back in unison just because it gives you that tiny feeling of being thrown off balance?  You might start unintentionally doing that for a few minutes on this thing (it's actually kind of fun but of course, there's not much of a workout factor doing it).  After about 10 minutes, I started to get the motion down.  It was pretty fun once i got the hang of it, but I agree with other reviews, it does make your feet sore... might try putting some foam on the footplates

Just 3 weeks ago, I came here looking at reviews for the Tony Little's Gazelle Freestyle, and read mixed reviews.  However, most were encouraging, and I thought it sounded like the thing for me.  I have now used the gazelle for less than 2 weeks, and have already seen results!

This is no lie -- I lost 2 inches in the waist, 2 in the hips, 2 in the abdomin, and 2 in the thighs.  I'm just as freaked as you may be, but I'm telling you, this is the honest truth!

I was discouraged that I had not been seeing any results on the scales lately, and needed to change things up, so I'd see something move again.  This gazelle did it for me.  At this time, I'm only up to 30 minutes a day, and 1-3/4 miles... I'm still a work in progress. But these results are no lie.  Just think how much results I'll see when I can stay on longer!  They advertise it as a low impact overall machine, and it truly is.  I have Rheumatoid Arthritis, and Fibromyalgia, so I was looking for something I could do that wouldn't hurt me.  I can honestly say I get a full workout on this machine... oh, I forgot to mention, also 1 inch in the arms.  So, that's a total of 9 inches in 2 weeks.

This is the best machine I've ever used, (we also have an exercise bike, and ab lounge, which I've not used in the last 2 weeks at all, cause I was getting such a good workout on the gazelle) and I'm so happy I found it.  And I thank you people, users of Amazon.com, for coming here and posting your reviews, and making it easy on me to know which machine to buy. Mine is the exact picture above, and folds up.  I also love that feature.  It's not a problem to just fold it up and lean it against the wall beside my bed after each use. Therefore, I've still got lots of walking space beside my bed.

I was a little skeptical about the Gazelle at first because it didn't look like you could get a work out from using it - but I was wrong!  But let's start at the beginning: 

It's pretty easy to set up - the directions on the dvd were great and I could do it all myself. I was really excited to use it so I hopped right on (I'm already used to ellipticals) and enjoyed a great workout.  I was sweating and after watching the training dvd, I worked my upper body and lower body.  

I look forward to using it tomorrow.  Now I don't have to drag myself to the gym.  I can work out at home!  

Downsides:  It does squeak, but some WD40 or petroleum jelly should fix that.  It folds up but it's not extremely portable.  I have it in my living room currently.  

All in all I recommend this product.  I can feel the toning and with good diet and weight training, you'll see results

This was bought for my boyfriend and I to sleep on when he comes to town. It is very comfortable and there is a lot of room for us!  It loses a tiny bit of air during the night but not so much that it is on the floor or anything.  It is a little difficult to get up off of it in the morning because it is like a water bed. If you get a good wave going you can jump right up!  The other problem I had with it is that it makes me sweat.  Even with the covering and a sheet. I am still sleeping on vinyl and so I sweat.  Not a lot but it is noticeable in the morning.  I am happy with the fact that it holds a lot of weight too because I am a big woman and my boyfriend is a big man. It holds us with no problem.  It was over all a very good purchase and I am happy with it

When the product came I realized that it wasn't what I was looking for in a fanny pack but I was impressed with its rugged construction.  I needed a pack to walk around Disney World and thought the two water bottle holders would come in handy.  I like to freeze my store bought water bottles so that they stay cold all day.  The water bottles that come with this pack are double wide and have a wide top - meaning you can't wrap your lips around it like a store bought bottle. Plus you have to wash and refill them as opposed to just buying another Dasani.  Unfortunately, you can't use the water bottle holder for anything much narrower than the included bottles because there is just a single strap across the bottom preventing their bottle from falling through but that wouldn't stop a regular 16 oz. job from slipping passed.  So I'm returning mine, but if your looking for non breakable, wide mouthed water bottles, in a rugged waistpack then this is for you.   PS for some reason the blue one is cheaper, at least when I bought it

  The bar itself is exactly what I wanted.  The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because of the troubles I had on the purchase.  The bar arrived literally hanging out of the box, the box was really, really torn up.  The collars that spin on the ends were not even with the bar, needless to say the bar was useless untill I finally found some collars on ebay.  Amazon refunded all my $$ as soon as they were aware of the problem.  Overall the bar is great

I have been buying this brand of prescription goggles for at least 10 years. The price has been gradually coming down each year. I was surprised to find them so reasonably priced at Amazon of all places. These fit well, adjust easily and are extremely durable. I swim 6 days each week and I can easily get over a year of use from each pair. Typically the gaskets begin to deteriorate long before the lenses, when used daily outdoors in chlorinated pools. Keep them stored safely so the lenses don't scratch and rinse them in clear water after swimming and you'll be thoroughly satisfied with your purchase

This is a great pair of swimming goggles.  I swim a couple of times a week and I can't see a thing without my glasses.  This pair is very comfortable and does a great job correcting my vision.  I can't imagine swimming without them.  They have a wide field of vision, the adjustment is easy to use, and stays adjusted.  I've never had a problem with leaking.  For less then twenty dollars you can't go wrong. They are the best goggles I have ever owned.  Much better then the other brands.  

Also, I recommend going slightly less then your current prescription, as the water will magnify things.

And so does Gadget Dad and Gadget Kids.

Not only is it an affordable piece of equipment, but it's great for the whole family.

Having twin boys age 13 and a husband and I who all added a few pounds of winter wool over the last few months, we really needed something that was going to fit nicely into our busy lives.  This does just that!

I'll admit, I was a bit upset when I found that Gadget Dad had ordered it because I was the normal skeptic, but it's been well worth the investment and then some

I purchase my total gym and though it did not give me the workout that I expected, It did help me to get firmer and leaner in a short period of time. I wish it offered more of a workout for the legs but overall, I am very happy with my gym and I use it all the time. Only a 20 minute workout 3 times a week made a huge difference in the way I look

I got this accessory with my Door Gym and I like it.  But, when they say this is an "efficient" accessory - they mean it.  It simply rests on the narrower neutral grip posts of the Door Gym.  The Door Gym has multiple grip areas, but two of them are perpendicular to the rest of the bar for narrow neutral grip chin ups.  The Broad reach bar is wide with downward grips (like lat pull down bar in a gym).  

Anyway, this works fine if you have the faith to try it the first time and prove to yourself it won't roll off because your body weight has it pinned on the posts. It has foam covering that adheres to the foam on the Door Gym posts. It will not roll easily, but it does a little. I think it is safe for adults who understand how to use it.  Do not give it to kids younger than about 15 (in my estimation) because some of them are too likely to play with, or misuse, it and get hurt.

Even though this thing works and does what you want a broad bar to let you do, I deducted a point in the rating because I don't think  they were up front in explaining exactly what it is and is not

This is a must have if you own the compatable shotgun. But a good tip if you get it would be to dump your bbs into another container and check through them for imperfections. (They will jam the magazine)

Pros:

- Very high cap! More than enough for a spring gun!

Cons:

- A bit long, and protrudes from the bottom of the gun quite a bit. (But still worth it

I've had this knife and their rainbow leak model for few years. All I wanted was a thin, small and light knife and I got it. The blade material is hard enough to stay sharp for a while, soft enough to easily sharpen but not brittle like a ceramic or carbon steel knife for example. I have had the vary tip break a couple times but it's because I was doing something foolish with it (like using it as a throwing knife *wink wink* ;) ). It's not the best, it's not the worst but can compete with ether, witch is the best in my opinion. Shortly after I bought it the speed safe spring broke, eehhh who cares it opens fine without. It's vary well made it can take all of my fat butts weight easily when laying sideways on a hard surface. It's vary thin profile is comfortable and I sometimes can't tell if I have it with me or not. It has what looks like brass or copper washers/bushings instead of cheap thin steel/plastic ones (means no binding up, even when in need of oil). The frame lock is far stronger than a line lock and best of all it deforms and wares much slower meaning my knife will stay ridged when opened for a long time.

My favorite thing about it is the fact you can position the clip henge up or down. I chose henge down so it's ready to open the second it comes out of my pocket.

If you want nice quality and availability for the price, kershaw is worth looking at

The knife is sleek and has a great profile. I love the speedsafe function on it. The blade lock is a bit stiff, but I suppose that's just so it doesn't slide open on accident

I purchased this pedometer to replace one that kept resetting itself back to zero ... the case cover on this one protects the buttons so it doesn't reset. I like the fact that I can open the lid and read the LED without taking it off. My only problem is the little leash ... it came with both a plastic and a metal clip.  The plastic clip has lost it's "springiness" and I'm sure will stop working soon; but at least I have the metal clip to fall back on

This pedometer is easy to set up and use.  I tested its accuracy at the local highschool track by walking a 1/2 mile, and sure enough, my pedometer read 1/2 mile. The clip is sturdy, I haven't had any problem with the device falling off.  The leash is a good extra - if it did fall off, it wouldn't hit the ground.  My doctor gave me a goal of 10,000 steps per day, so I wear this all day long.  It is light and I don't notice I am wearing it throughout the day.

The only downfall to this device (as is probably true with others)is that your stride is measured for walking, so when you are running or doing other cardio activity (elliptical) it doesn't accurately measure your distance.  Since your stride is longer during a cardio activity (running), and the device is measuring your walking stride, the distance measurement falls short.  However, the actual number of steps taken is still accurately measured.  I suppose you could adjust the setting to a running stride when running to bridge this gap

I take a Ringside Boxing class at my gym and everyone bought these gloves and really likes them.  I ordered them from online because it was the only place I could find a size small.  I am very happy with them.  They offer excellent wrist support and protection for your fingers.  I really like the bar in the palm to help you grip when making a fist.  They do tend to leave your hands a little black after sweating in them, but it washes right off.  The only thing bad I have to say is that after only a couple of times of using them, the threading started to come apart at the pinky finger.  It can be sewed up, but you shouldn't have to do that so soon after the purchase.  No one else in my class seems to have had this problem.  I still gave them 4 stars, because I have a hunch that the threading isn't a common problem and I love them otherwise

I've been using these gloves for 3 years now and I had to buy a new pair as they were starting to be ripped off between the fingers.

What I like: 
easy to set
good wrist support
good grip with the middle bar

What I don't like:
using wraps can be difficult if you don't take a size above and I recommend wraps otherwise the leather will burn your skin.

For the price and the time that I've used them (2-3 times a week on heavy bags), they performed very well

These cars can be summed up in two words FUN and LOUD.  I have two and my four year old loves it and so do all his friends.  They work great throughout the house and hold their charge really well.  I am even thinking of getting a third.  They do leave little marks on the wood floors but it cleans easily.  Well worth it.

We bought these so the children could have something to play with during the winter.  We backed our vehicles out of the garage, and zoom....they were off having fun.

The box says "Ages 3+" and up to 55 pounds.  The bumper buggie looks small, but it is roomy enough for my 5 1/2 year old.  He weighs 45 pounds and is 45 inches tall.  He can stretch his legs out in the car, but chooses to keep his knees bent while driving.  My two year old can also work the controls.

It is easy to use and the kids can do a complete 360.  My only complaint is that it is a little bit noisy, but no more than other battery-operated vehicles.

I highly recommend this item.  It is so much fun!  Best part is that there is little assembly required.  The only thing we had to do was screw the seat into the car

It was suprisingly easy for me to put together considering I'm a 110lb girl. It only took about 3 hours but i did have trouble getting all the screws to get into their proper holes. It is slightly rickitty however I can go as fast as i want to and it won't brake or anything. It really is nice to be able to lose 200 calories while you watch your favorite T.V. shows.  Also, I am very tall and I had plenty of space, and it's nice to have the handle bars in the front and on either side. 

If you are looking for a reasonably priced bike that won't brake on you, Marcy is a good choice

This thing is great - my wife put it together in half an hour and she's an idiot. Nonetheless it is very solid.
As a long time alcoholic I have a hard time getting up and a harder time going up and down stairs or walking in the grocery store, etc. Because this thing is low I can have the tv on, a drink on the floor on one side and my cigarettes on the floor on the other side and can reach them both while I pedal! I did 1 mile the first day at medium drag (despite what other reviewers have said there is a HUGE difference in drag between settings), 2 miles the second and am up to 5 miles per day now -  now I can drive my car to the store because my legs work again - this thing is really good. Plus it's silent - dropping two ice cubes in a glass makes more noise as does lighting a Bic lighter. But it is made in China... Note: shipping was free and it came in just a couple of days

If you're looking for a basic model without all the bells and whistles, this is an excellent choice. It's also very quiet and it's compact size was definitely on of the selling points for me. Only problem is that I wish the seat adjustment were easier to work. It gets a little stuck sometimes. Again, if you are looking for a basic model this is a good choice

For the price this low-end home gym is generally able to do the things I wanted a cheap home gym to do.  However, there are a few issues you need to consider before buying it.  The biggest issue is ergonometric - this unit is not designed to be used by anyone over perhaps 5'10" or 5'11".  I'm 6'1" and this creates problems for me.  I have to find work-arounds to use a unit designed for people smaller than me.  The problem is that form is very important when doing the exercises (when you don't pay attention to form, you either reduce the effectiveness of the exercise or risk injury) and finding work-arounds sometimes compromises your form during the exercise.
There are also a few quality issues but these were not entirely unexpected considering the price of the unit.  It would have been nice if the bench padding were a little better but its adequate.  The two most annoying quality issues involve the plate bars (the bars that hold the weights).  This first issue was with the plate bar on the lat tower (cable) unit.  It wasn't level.  This means the weights keep trying to fall off one side as you put them on.  The second issue is also with the plate bars.  The unit is designed to accommodate standard plates (small holes in the middle) or Olympic plates (big holes in the middle).  A "sleeve" is included with the unit that slips over the standard size plate bar that enables one to use Olympic plates (big holes).  However the outer diameter of the sleeve is slightly smaller than standard Olympic size so an Olympic size spring collar (to hold the weights on the bar) is too big and doesn't work.  I went down to Home Depot and bought wood clamps to hold the plates in place.  Kind of a pain but functional (just another work-around).  If you buy this unit you probably want to go with standard plates (small hole) rather than Olympic plates (big hole).
So I put this at 4 stars because for this price you really can't expect too much and it generally delivers what I expected a cheap home gym unit to do - with the one caveat:  persons over 5'10" should try to find a home gym designed for taller people.  Since only 5% of the US population is over 6 feet tall manufacturers tend to design for smaller people.  If you're tall, good luck on that search

I bought the V2000 last year and it has worked great since then.  The compass has always given me accurate directions and has lasted through one winter and one summer so far.  I always left my V2000 in the vehicle, although the manual did state that you should take the device with you when the temperature is hot.  The V2000 has visible at all situations.  I can see it clearly in the dark with the V2000's automatic backlight, and see it clearly on a sunny day.  Finding a good place to put the temperature probe, however, is a hassle if you want to get accurate results.  Calibration was also a hassle for me.  You have to be on leveled ground and make a fairly even circle in order to get accurate readings.

*****
This is an upscale designer water bottle, top of the line, and so much fun. The designs Of Sigg's water bottles are gorgeous, from the plain, solid color bottles, to the ones with intricate designs. They are simply beautiful! I switched from regular plastic water bottles because of health concerns, thinking it would take more work to maintain. These do necessitate regular cleaning (I clean mine every day), but having something so beautiful to drink from makes the cleaning fun. Sort of like my rings, glasses, and watch, I now consider my Sigg personal water bottle a vital accessory, reminding me to drink more water, making a statement about my values, and expressing myself with a special design. Yes, all in a water bottle!

Sigg of Switzerland water bottles are very high quality, made of light aluminum on the outside, slightly insulated, and covered with a special powder coat on the inside that prevents any leaching whatsoever, unlike plastic and polycarbonate water bottles. They are light, durable, and perfect for any activity. Well water tastes spectacular in these bottles, just like from the tap.

Sigg bottles come with several different types of tops. I bought the screw top because I don't like sports tops, and I don't mind unscrewing the top when I want a drink. It is totally leakproof, which is important to me. The top is pretty and can be hooked onto a carabiner. I get comments on it all the time, "What's that? I love it!" The sports top version is ok; I just am not a fan, as I don't feel like I can get enough water from the little stream from the sports top. However, for convenience, you might prefer it. For children, there is a cap-type top. All are leak-proof. If you are ever unsatisfied with the top, you can buy a screw top separately to fit your Sigg bottle.

Sigg makes their personal water bottle in .6L and 1L in this style. I have both. I use the .6L for sports activities because they are smaller. When I won't have to carry the container, I like the larger bottle. Sigg also makes a smaller .3L bottle for children that is a perfect size for young people. You can buy Siggs in alternative sizes too, such as .75L, .4L (for kids), .6L, .5L. You can occasionally find this bottle in the 1.5L size, also. Search Amazon for the perfect size.

Pick a style and pattern you like, as this bottle is a personal accessory, and should reflect your style. The colors are vibrant and even prettier than they seem in the pictures on Amazon.

They are expensive, but they are so durable that you can plan on them lasting many years. I consider them both an accessory and an investment in my health, so they are well worth it value-wise for me.

Highly recommended.

This cooler is the perfect fit and size for our boat! The compact size was the main reason for buying this cooler. The lid is easy to open and close and it doubles as an extra seat.  It keeps everything nice and cold all day on the boat.

I was very hesitant to purchase this bike because of all the problems other people reported with parts coming damaged/rusty. The only problem I had was the bar on the rear-bottom wouldn't fit all the way into the slot to put one of the screws in. I tried really hard to get it in, but it just wouldn't budge. Luckily, I could get the screw in on the other end, so it is relatively secure. 
The bike is a bit wobbly when your riding - now I don't know if this is because of my problem with the bar, or because that's just the way it is. but I don't feel like it's going to fall apart or tip over or anything.
Over all, this is a really nice bike. The price is absolutely the best for what you're getting - especially if you choose the free super saver shipping. I got mine about a week from the day I ordered it. I don't think you will find another bike comparable to this for the price. Most recumbent bikes at this price don't offer any kind of resistance, what to speak of programs or the pulse monitor. 
It is really quiet - I can do it at 5 in the morning while my daughter is sleeping in the next room and not have to turn the TV up too loud. The seat is a bit uncomfortable, but it's not that big of a deal considering the price

The bike arrived in fine condition, no problems with bent or rusty parts like other people have reported.  It was really easy to assemble.  Once I had assembled it I tried it out and found that it made a really annoying noise as the wheel went around - as if the gears were scraping against something.  So, I undid all the screws (a pain) and opened the plastic-enclosed base.  There was a bracket that was meant to hold the pulse wires out of the way, but the adhesive on it had worn off or something and it was just kind of hanging, and would interfere with the gears.  So I taped it to the side, closed the plastic up, and that was that.  

Since then the bike has worked really well.  I wish there was more ability to move it back - it is a good length for me but I can see how someone taller could have trouble with it.  The seat is not terribly comfortable, which gets to be a problem on longer rides, but it's fixable with a pillow or cushion.  The console is great - has all the information displayed all the time.  Plenty of resistance.

Overall there are some problems with it, but for under two hundred dollars, I suppose I can't complain too much.  Definitely worth the money

This is an excellent product.  My 7 year old son had ADHD and he is constantly moving.  He has to take medicine to focus at school during the day and moves non-stop from waking up to going to bed at night.  His teacher was happy with his attention at school, but he was still fidgeting a lot.  She gave him this "Wiggle Seat" for his desk and has seen an amazing improvement in his ability to focus and and participate in class.  My son has noticed as well.  He has a hard time sitting at the table when doing his homework at night.  He told me I needed to get him a "Wiggle Seat" for home because it helps him concentrate.

If you have a child with ADHD and you're looking for alternatives to medication, this is a great product to try.  And they'll get great posture as a bonus! :

Great flooring system for a home weightlifting gym. It's heavy and very dense, very similar if not the same type of stuff you see in most commercial gym's. Heavy duty, takes dropped dumbbell punishment, and resists damage/cuts. Use a drywall T-Square as a guide, and put a new blade in a box cutter. Take several passes to cut it and take your time. It cuts straight and square for a professional look. I will definitely buy these again when I get a bigger room for the gym

Dear Amazon,
     My new royal blue Armour duffle bag is the best travel bag I have ever owned.  It is durable beyond anything I have ever had and its design is beautiful with the honey combed stiching and perfectly balanced color design of blue and black.  I actually ordered a small royal blue carry-on duffle directly from Under Armour so the two match and I am utterly pleased.  Under Armour is definitely a KEEPER!!!!!

I already have a set of standard Bones Swiss, but since I was putting together a longboard with smaller wheels, I decided to get slightly faster bearings to make up for it.  These definately firt the bill, and the with the cheap $35.00 price and free shipping that Amazon offers, you can't go wrong.  These may seem dissappointing at first, but after about 3-5 hours of riding, they'll break in and go very fast.  Overall very reccomendable to anyone in the skateboard world

Just a really great sports toy for kids. My son is 9 and he is already pretty good at it, but it is hard to keep my 15 year old from stealing it and riding it himself.  I would highly recommend the flowboard for lots of outdoor fun.

My 13 yr old wanted this and a waveboard for Christmas.  Since his dad and I are divorced, he ended up with both.  I got him the flowboard and he LOVES it.  Of course, I tried it too and was shocked to find it was actually easier for me to play with than his regular skateboard.  There is no chance I'm even going to try the waveboard, as I do value my intact bones.  I've been wanting to learn how to snowboard and this definitely gives the feeling of snowboarding, but without the snow!  It's well made, fun and definitely a hit

THe swim belt I ordered was awesome.  Perfect for my 3 year old to learn how to swim.  The great thing about it is that you can adjust their bouyancy.   Take one or two of the floaty squares off and they have to try to swim a little harder.  It also helps them keep the correct body position for learning how to swim

I would just like to tell everyone who didn't understand the use of this item...They aren't actually anti-gravity boots!  They are used for a type of exercise called inversion where you put the boots on and attatch them to a bar hanging either from a wall or cieling, so in other words, you hang upside down with these boots while attatched to a bar.  They are in no way meant to make you float, or fly, or anything else that can only be found in sci-fi magazines..

These are good to keep on hand for hiking for that quick energy and I also try to keep some of these or a smiliar product in my purse if my blood sugar drops.  I am not a diabetic, but I have gotten low blood sugar my whole life and when I get it I use this or something else to get it back up fast so I can be comfortable.  This really works and tastes great too.  They really did well with this product.  I like to go geocaching and I get out for a long while on hikes this is great to have in the backpack when I need quick fuel

I own several Pelican cases.  When I saw the options for cases for my MacBook, I knew that this case would be just what I needed.

The MacBook 13.3" fits snugly inside the case.  The case says 13" notebooks, but the extra width of the MacBook is accepted.  The case is shipped with small foam large and small spacers.  I used the large spacers but placed them inside the top lid of the case so that the notebook screen wouldn't be opened when I opened the Pelican.

I don't have any worries now when I toss my notebook into a backpack and travel.  I felt uneasy about having to take my notebook out of my Pelican 1510 carry-on case when gate-checking my carry-on luggage for small regional jets

I bought this for my son (recommended by his special ed teacher) and the whole family has been using it ever since.  It's a nice, sturdy, trampoline and it's not too expensive.  The "folding" part is a little disappointing which I why it's not getting full stars.  However, we haven't needed to use that feature so it wasn't that important to us.  Overall this is a good quality trampoline for those who are looking for something less expensive

I purchased this for Christmas for my 8 year old son to play with.  It was $329 with free shipping compared to $450 at the local sports store.  The finished product looks great, appears to be rugged and stable and is quite easy to adjust.  I only gave it 4 stars because assembly was not easy, and I am mechanically inclined. Practically all the holes needed to be drilled or reamed out in order to accept the bolts and the directions were ambiguous.  It was a 4 hour assembly, with filling the base with screened sand really taxing my patience.  But the smile on the 8 year old's face was well worth the aggravation.    

On a side note, I ordered 70% of my Christmas shopping from Amazon, with everything except this arriving before the estimated delivery date (everything else shipped UPS).  They shipped this via DHL, which never delivered the package.  I had to drive 120 mile round trip to pick it up at the DHL facility and take time off of work the Friday before Christmas to retrieve my son's primary gift.  I emailed Amazon requesting $70 credit to reimburse me for my time and gas, which they did in a few days.  This was an oversized package that I assume UPS would not accept.  Nonetheless, their choice of shippers reflects on Amazon as a company.

I've worked out with Cathe for about 6 months now, and I have to say, this is one of my favorite workouts.  It combines cardio with upper and lower body in a 60 minute circuit workout.  

The cardio bursts are short but intense- expect to jump, do Power 15's, fast feet shuffles, spike lunges, etc.  Lower body work - well, let's just say, I hope you like to do leg press- since you'll be doing it  - A LOT.  There are a total of 6 sets of leg press - on each leg.  Also, Cathe inserts some static lunges and squats, among other moves.  She does hover squats with pulses of 16 over the high step- your quads will be feeling the burn, there!  Arm work includes typical weighted and non-weight work, such as tricep dips off the high step, push ups, bicep curls, overhead extension, etc.

Overall, if you're looking for a challenge and a new circuit workout to shock your muscles, this is the workout for you.  Beginners, beware- you can modify certain exercises (I use dumbbells instead of a barbell) - but this is more for the intermediate or advanced exerciser

I recently recieved this watch as a Christmas gift.  I am amazed at the amount of information this watch can gather.  I can check my altitude, see if a storm is brewing, and time each lap of my mile jog.  Everthing works great and is very accurate.  After a glance through the instruction manuel I was able to use and set all the functions with ease.  I love the feel of the band; it is a perfect fit for my wrist.  I would reccomend the stainless steel for best look and price.  This watch is truly fun to use and show off.  It is the perfect watch

You'll never mistake the Shake flashlight for a powerful spotlight, but that's not it's purpose.  It's a niche item, the perfect flashlight to stick in your car trunk or emergency bag and then forget about it.  With no batteries or bulbs, you know it'll always be ready for use whenever you need it.

When it first arrives, you'll need to shake it hard for a couple minutes to charge it up, but just think of it as aerobic exercise.  Once it's charged, it provides sufficient light to read instructions or maps, determine colors of wires or diagrams, and keep you from stumbling around in the dark.  I was surprised by just how bright the Shake flashlight was after about 3 minutes of hard shaking.  The only improvement I can think of would be to have a small diode glow when the flashlight is turned off.  When the light begins to dim, a few shakes will keep the light strong enough to use.

Unlike the previous reviewer, I had absolutely no problems with delivery - I ordered it on 12/26 (non-expedited mail) and it arrived on 12/30, exactly as described

I am very impressed with the F4. It is very easy to use and a good basic heart rate monitor. It is easier to program than my F6, and it fits better.

Polar makes the best HR monitors, and it works with all their chest straps - coded and uncoded, and even with ones that are not from them. I have Vision Fitness exercise equipment, and the strap works with their HR function. Sometimes I strap the watch to the equipment so I can read while I exercise, and I'm able to continually see the HR without constantly changing the view on the equipment.

The color is more of a gray color than an ice blue, so it goes with just about anything you wear. I'm really looking forward to using this unit while I go out and do my walks this spring! 

I can't imagine buying anything else but Polar. This is my third watch and all three of them are still working well

I love this watch!  It's easy to use.  It's also a very basic watch.  It gives your heart rate, zone and calories burned.  It's very nice for what it is supposed to do.  If you're looking for a watch with a lot of bells and whistles, this is not the one for you.  It looks nice and it's not too bulky.  The only reason I would have gotten the F6 is because it says it has something that prevents "cross talk" (interference with others wearing a heart monitor watch.  There are three of us where this same exact watch in my cycling class and we've never had a problem with "cross talk."  As the other reviews said, there is no backlight.  Would recommend

I bought this for myself to play with (I'm 35) and after all the presents were opened and toys, video games, and everything were forgotten (about 4 hours after Christmas), this was the ongoing favorite of the season.  Everybody, younger (down to 8) and older (to 45) had a blast with this thing after a couple minutes coaching. It's already on everybodys wish lists for upcoming birthdays and such.  This is a GREAT present for 11-18 boy. Fair warning though, there will be some good spills on the fairly short, steep learning curve - helmets, knee pads, blah, blah, are a must (and a video camera!

I bought this from lifeline recently and it has been an EXCELLENT addition to my home gym equipment.  I'm not a person who travels back and forth to a gym each day.  I also do not like paying an arm and a leg for expensive pieces of workout equipment that eventually become expensive coat racks.  

This workout solution is about as low tech as it can get.  I agree with the previous reviews below--you could almost make this one yourself.  It consists of a strip of mesh webbing--like seatbelt material; two adjustable, quick locking clips; handles made of webbing and plastic tubes; and another piece of plastic tubing that locks the Jungle Gym into place when the door is shut.  The equipment is simple, but sets up in seconds.  The clips adjust quickly and are incredibly secure.

It's so simple--but it really works.  The emphasis of the instruction sheet and the DVD that came along with it, is in upper body strength.  You can do chin ups--by regulating height, you can work up from lifting part of your body weight to full body weight.  For me, this was the best part of the Jungle Gym.  My chin ups/pull ups have improved remarkably by using the device.

Body rows, push ups, and fly push ups are also possible.  Using the Jungle gym, pushups take on a new dimension with a fuller range of motion (like an Atlas pushup)and given the instability of the webbing, you also get more of a core workout.  

You can use the webbing for balance as well as to maintain better technique when doing squats.  You can also make the exercises more challenging by using a fitness ball.  You can do abdominal crunches by holding the handles and lifting your feet from the floor.

Some exercises (full body rows and dips) are difficult when attached to a door and Lifeline suggests draping the Jungle Gym over a tree limb so you can achieve a truly vertical workout.  I have not yet tried using this over a tree limb...  However, I was able to perform the dips with some creativity while attached to a door but it was not easy.

This is not a full fitness solution.  But when used in conjunction with weights and exercise bands, it really makes the home gym complete.  I have searched for a pull up bar for a long time that is removable, but none of the current offerings fit the odd sized door frames and moldings of my 99 year old house.  The Jungle Gym has worked.  Given the ability to do pull ups of varying difficulty, it has also improved my ability to do pull ups/Chin ups over a short period of time.

The downside of the device is that it requires a STURDY DOOR and DOOR FRAME.  I would be leery of using the device is the door does not close securely AND LOCK or if you are worried about the integrity of your house's construction.  Remember, the Jungle Gym is strong enough to hold your body weight, but the door it is connected to has to be able to do the same.  If not, you will find yourself flat on your back with a new home improvement project to do.  Remember too, that when your feet are touching the ground and you do pull towards the door, the weight decreases as you pull. This is not a defect of the device, it's just the physics of the situation.  (With free weights, the weight is stable throughout your range of motion.  With exercise bands the weight increases as the band lengthens.)  Also, this is a great device for weight/circuit training, but is not really an aerobic solution.

The Jungle Gym, along with a few exercise bands are IDEAL for travel.  I used mine with three lifeline exercise bands (2 R6s and 1 R8), exercise band door attachment and the lifeline triple grip handles.  This yielded a gym that weighed less than two pounds, fit in my suitcase easily and allowed for a variety of body weight and resistance exercises

except for the nifty little metal clips that keep the strap at the length you set until you press on it to lengthen/shorten the strap again. Does exactly what it is supposed to do, and makes for challenging exercises due to the inherent instability. Great for spotting oneself too. I would buy it again, tho I don't think it is as indispensible as some might have you believe. So if you can burn the $35 or so, get it with no fear. Otherwise, use your frustration to fuel your desire to workout

I bought this item after much research and this particular model was suggested to me by a friend.  No problems at all with shipping; package was in perfect shape though only delivered to my back steps.  I opened up the box and brought in pieces individually, with the flywheel being the heaviest (though I was able to bring in myself).  It took me about 2 hours to put together.  Instruction book was better than most I have seen, and only problem was the misprint in bolt sizes, but you can figure that out easily (as everyone has noted on their reviews).  The elliptical's size is on the smaller size and fits well in my sitting room.  Easily moved if need be.
In regards to the workout.  I cross train on my treadmill and found this workout to be as effective.  There are a variety of programs so you can vary your workout.  The backward motion is a little awkward for me (I am 5'3") but found that holding onto the lower handlebars works well (versus the movable upper ones).  The machine is very quiet, only slight squeeking coming from the upper handlebars that disappeared with a little WD40.  It has very smooth movement and you can definitely tell a difference with increasing the level, which I was worried about as it doesn't have an incline as some gym machines do.  The heel rise can occur when you do not sit back on your heels when working out, so you just need to be aware of your foot placement.  The foot pads are comfortable and a good size.  
Most of all, for those who do monitor their heart rate, I have a Polar F11 heart monitor (with chest strap) and this monitor is within a 3 beat difference at the most.  I recommend to let the monitor read for a minumum of 45 seconds before you follow the rate.  This held true for me even if pacing at 70 RPM's or above.  I listen to my IPOD when I work out, so I have not used the book holder.  The water holder holds 24 oz Polar Spring bottles without any difficulty taking out and replacing the bottle.
I highly recommend this for anyone who is looking at increasing their fitness level in the comfort of their own home.  It's very well built/solid, quiet, effective, and affordable ($599, free pad, free shipping)

My husband and I finished off a bottle of wine before assembling the unit. : ) It only took us an hour and a half to assemble, and our kids were running around like a couple of nuts during the process. After we finished the assembly, we both took a turn on a preset program. The machine is extremely sturdy, quiet, and worked like a charm - just like a unit found at a gym. We're extremely pleased with our purchase and would recommend it to anyone

Just purchased this chair 3 wks ago and so far so good!  I use it almost every morning for 15 minutes while I watch the news.

Needed a chair like this because I'm starting to get a gut and my pants are getting too tight.  I hate exercizing and definitely don't have the will/motivation to go to the gym consistently.  I bought the ultra version because I needed to be able to hide it away when it isn't being used.  Once folded up (4 1/2 inches tall - 29 inches wide - 39 inches long) it fits very nicely under my couch.

It is fairly easy to fold up/unfold but it could be easier which is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.  There are 2 bungee type straps that need to be unhooked, 2 curved handle bars need to be removed (simple twist knobs), and one stabilizer bar undone (simple twist knob) to fold this unit down.  Removing the parts and folding the unit takes less than 2 minutes.  Not difficult just wish it was easier.

Overall, I would definitely make this purchase again knowing what I now know.

I worked with Eureka to design this exclusive tent for Amazon.  (Note: I work at Amazon and am biased),...but want to share why we built this tent for Amazon customers.

Eureka is one of the best names in the Outdoors industry.  Their Timberline tent design has been one of the most popular tents for decades.  They have built on that innovation, and I believe build the best "family camping tents" in the business.  

This tent was designed to offer customers an incredible value for a large family tent that has all the special features for a good-sized family:
- Spacious  and big.  It has a center height of 7 feet, and feels huge.  It's a 11x11 and gives you 121 square feet.  You can fit 2 queen sized airbeds quite comfortably
- Easy assembly.  Shock-corded fiberglass poles and ring-and-pin systems make for an easy set-up with 2 folks.  
- Quality.  From seams that are sealed to high quality mesh.  This tent is designed for rugged use through 3 seasons.

As I re-read this review, I realize I haven't done a sufficient job in highlighting the spacious feel of this tent.  7 foot center height is tremendous!

It works as advertised. Not a lot to say about a bike rack. I have hardly any wobble from mine, and I suspect those that do didn't assemble theirs correctly or aren't tightening the hitch pin bolt down far enough. My only complaint is the weight--it uses a really heavy steel tube for the vertical portion of the rack, which I don't quite understand. The vertical tube has the lowest load, with the highest load being on the hitch draw tube. But it's not that big a deal. It just increases the weight on the rear of the car needlessly

We also bought this bike rack because of the price and it will hold 4 bikes.  It could be improved on the Hitch end but it was not bad.  It does tend to loosen at highway speeds but we use it with the larger attachment for class 3 hitches.  It kept our bikes from damaging our Suburban.   We use it for adult bikes and also several smaller BMX bikes.  It is more challenging to get the BMXs on.  One trick is to make sure you swing the arm down to mount the one inside bike, then tilt it back up for the other three.   Also use a wrench and tighten the hitch bolt very tight with the lock washer or it will loosen on the highway. We also bought a big Schwin cable lock to run through the bike frames for security while parked

Neoprene pouch keeps water cool, but it has a very strong displeasing smell, kind of like used motoroil, which overpowers the taste of what your drinking from the bottle. So you might want to pour your drink into a cup to enjoy it.

This item garners the same complaint that I have with the Aqua Sphere pull buoy: it floats, is functional, but nicks/gouges very easily.  I try to keep this away from the sharper objects in my swim gear bag (snorkel, fins), but it still gets dented, nicked, scratched, and gouged.  Regardless, it works quite well and I really like the smooth underside, the ribbed handholds, and the ample crescent at the base (perfect for kicking with my head down into the water).  One of the best parts is that it isn't as small as a kid's kickboard, but it's not huge, either.  Really good product overall

I just recently baught this weight tree since i had a weight bench and I needed a place to put the 400 lbs. besides the floor.  The the weight tree does hold that much weight and could hold more, the only thing I do not like is that it does bend in a little, when you put the max weight on a slot.  But it does its job

Treadmill sets up fairly quickly, unless you are a moron, then it might take you some time.  The pistons are stiffer than I thought they would be, allowing for a very challenging upper body workout.  I usually row while I am watching TV or a game, and have never had to turn up the volume because of the noise - it really is very quiet.  Unless you are looking for a health club quality rower, this rower would be a very good pick for nearly anyone

I had one of these similar many years ago and let it go at a garage sale. Dumb idea! As I get older, this Stamina machine has replaced it and is giving me all the exercise I need. Good to set in front of the tv and row for 30 minutes, I've gone from a size 40 to a size 36 waist. I like the hydraulic part of it and the adjustability

I bought this for my medium sized 9mm. Luger with the laser sight attached to it. My cousine, who has been in the Military for several years, recommended it to me. I'm only 3 feet 6 inches tall, and it fits me well. He is over six feet tall, and it fits him just as well. It takes a little time to adjust it to your liking but, well worth the money. It is comprable to holster costing 5 times as much

When I got the machine and started putting it together, I noticed I was missing a few small pieces.  Understandable, I think, as this machine was shipped from Germany.  3$ and a trip to my local hardware store later, the Kettler Kadett was all assembled.  I had some problems with the foot straps loosening while I exercised, but I found that a velcro strap fastened around the toe area (to provide an additional foot strap) and some velcro adhesive slapped on the existing foot strap fixed that problem.  

With the exception of those minor nuisances, the Kettler Kadett is an amazing piece of machinery.  When I use it, I can tell it's not going to break or fall apart at the nuts and bolts.  It went together easily and it's solid as a rock when I use it.  I've never rowed on a real boat in my life, but this feels just as I'd imagine it would.  And of course the most important part, when I get off, I feel like I've gotten a gym quality work out.

4 out of 5 stars for this rowing machine, the packaging could have been better and slightly re-designed foot wraps, but all in all an excellent buy

I had a cheaper version of this product and the strap was flimsy and cut into me in certain poses not to mention that it was too short for many poses.  The hugger-mugger strap is not only long enough but thicker and smoother so it doesn't cut in to my skin and it is comfortable to grip.

Many years ago, an acquaintance of mine was the property manager of a low-rent motel.  One morning, while he was in the back office behind the front desk, two men jumped over the counter and started beating on the door.  He could see them, but they could not see him through the privacy security glass.  The men continued to beat on the door, trying to get in.  He waited inside patiently, with his Glock pistol.  As soon as the door fell and the men ran inside, he shot them both.  They turned out to be high school teenagers who were trying to break in to obtain crack money.  I recalled that many in the community dissaproved of his actions.  It turned out that he had plenty of time to leave through the back door and call for help.  When asked why he had to kill them, he simply said, "I own the life of anyone who threatens my personal safety.  I did it because it was my right and I could."  Fortunately, it was considered self-defense.

I remembered that he always carried a short stick, attached to his keys.  It was not until many years later that I finally figured out what that little wooden stick was.  I became interested in self-defense and decided to buy a baton for myself.

This was my first Kubaton.  I was concerned because this one has a pointed end.  The pointed end, although not sharp compared to a blade weapon, will easily punch a hole through four layers of very heavy cordura cloth with little effort on my part.  I was afraid that if ever I had to use it, the amount of damage it will cause and its design would make it hard for me to claim that I was acting in self-defense.  I bought another Kubaton, from the same manufacturer, with a flat end.  The replacement baton is exactly like this one, except the end is flat.  

I tested the replacement and it will also punch a hole through heavy canvas.  But it takes a lot more force to do so.  More importantly, to the average person, it looks less aggressive than this one.  If I had to use it in self-defense, a presiding judge or jury might be less likely to think of it as a weapon.

If you are not concerned about perception, then get this pointed baton.  If it can easily punch a hole through layers of cordura cloth (the same material used in heavy duty outdoor bags, outerwear, and hiking shoes), it can easily injure an attacker who might be wearing several layers of clothes.  But please understand that some might put this in the same category as they would a knife.  That might make it difficult to claim self-defense, in the event that you have to use it to protect yourself.  

My old acquaintance was well-versed and knowledgeable.  He not only knew how to use his weapons, but he also understood where the line is between self-defense and assault.  He knew just the limits of what he could get away it in the use of deadly force to defend himself.  This pointed baton, made out of hardened aluminum alloy, is probably for such a person.

MY FRIEND'S TIP:

Here's a tip from that old acquaintance of mine.  The keys themselves are a part of the weapon.  And you can make them more effective, which will increase the damage from the baton.  Take some keys that you no longer use.  Any metal key would do, but try to find different sizes.  About four of them would do.  Take the keys to a grinder (even a rasp will do) and sharpen the teeth of each key.  Now, put the four keys in the keyring along with your regular keys.  Face the sharp keys in opposite directions.  Meaning two should face one way, but the other two should face in the opposite direction.  The idea is that when you swing the baton like a flail, the sharpened keys would cut into the attacker's flesh.  The keys are faced in opposite directions so that you can do major damage regardless of which direction that you are swinging.  

CITAN'S EXPERIMENT: 

Please keep in mind that you can also cut your hand.  I tried this technique.  I wore a pair of leather work gloves and swung against a wooden post.  The sharpened keys bounced back and hit the back of my hand.  Without the gloves, my hand would have gotten badly cut.  For what it's worth, I swung against a large watermelon and the keys didn't bounce back though.  I don't have anything else to add here, except maybe it might be good to swing against an attacker's fleshy parts to prevent the keys from rebounding.  I'm not an expert though.  But it was fun trying it on a watermelon

Let me start by saying that I ordered this rowing machine on April 2 and it arrived on April 5!  I was so excited!

Even though it has poor instructions on putting this machine together, it isn't impossible.  The tension strap is twisted around part of the machine that needs to be unwrapped first and that is not mentioned in the instructions.  Also, two of the steps seem to be out of order, but I still give this product a 5 star rating.  

When I was in college, I used a machine like this in their exercise room and loved it.  This is just like it, but I think it's even better.  I don't have a problem with the foot holders on this machine like I did with the one at college.

The quality is great for the value.  I feel that I have enough resistance and that I'm getting the workout that I'm looking for.  I use an elliptical rider first, then I get on my rower.  This is now rounding out my workout and I love it!  My elliptical rider is a gym quality machine and was very expensive but worth the cost.  This rower is inexpensive, but doesn't feel like a cheap machine.  Again, I am thrilled with it. 

By the way, I don't think that you can tell it in the picture, but the fan cover has holes all the way around it.  When I'm working out I can feel the breeze that it is generating.  It doesn't blow me away, but it's enough to cool me off some.

I hope you find the machine you're looking for.  If you're looking to save some money and get a great workout, this may be the rower for you.

Let me start out by saying that this rower is not perfect. It is, in fact,  flawed. As you may have noticed, I still gave it a five star rating and I will try to explain the reasons for doing so.

Reading the reviews here, I noticed two complaints: One pointing out that this machine doesn't perform to the same standards that professional gym rowers do and the other regarding assembly of this machine.

I researched the various rowers available in the market for quite a while. I spent a lot of time and effort driving around and trying various models before purchasing this one simply because I tend to be an informed shopper who wants to get value for his money. During my research, it became very evident that my favorite rower is a Water Rower followed by Schwinn's WindRigger - both were extremely smooth in their operation. Both were also about $1000! At any rate, these sophisticated rowers gave me a benchmark against which to compare the Integrity and it should surprise nobody that the Integrity doesn't really come close to the performance of either of the other two rowers. And it shouldn't, given it substantially lower price.

And this is exactly what it important in considering this rower: You cannot expect to get a professional-grade rower for such a low price just like you cannot expect to get the comfort and performance of a Rolls Royce if you are buying a Honda. Nonetheless, what you DO get from Integrity is well within the parameters of what I would expect for about $200.

The machine is reasonably stable, it is reasonably smooth, and it does provide a great workout. The noise level is also not too bad and actually seems less than that of the WindRigger. The electric monitor is basic and provides speed, time, calories burned, and distance. It also provides an option that continuously cycles through all these functions so you cant track all of them during your workout. The seat is comfortable and slides smoothly along the track and the whole thing actually has a pretty professional look to it and doesn't appear flimsy. I was also quite surprised by the level of resistance this rower provides - it is much more than that of the Schwinn WindRigger. In addition, resistance can be adjusted pretty easily.

I think my only disappointment is that the air-flow created during operation is not channeled toward the person using the machine to aid in cooling him/her down - but this is certainly a flaw I can live with. As a potential buyer you should also be aware that the rower tends to slide across smooth surfaces such as tile - which means you need to have a non-slip mat under it if you intend to use it on such a surface.

As I said before, I also read that at least one person had a problem assembling this rower. I cannot confirm this problem. Assembly was extremely easy and quick - even though the instructions are not the greatest. However, it should be quite clear to most people where parts go and what needs to be hooked up where. Winding up the chain onto the gear wheel is a breeze, too. All you need to do is unhook it from the retracting cord that you hooked it up to one or two steps before. I suppose the person who wrote the instructions could have switched these steps to make it more logical - but as I said, the instructions are not great. 

Taking all these factors into account, I think Integrity provides a fantastic product for a very low price. It does exactly what it is supposed to do and it does so in a surprisingly good manner. However, as with any product, your expectations should be realistic and if they are, you will not be disappointed. If you expect a gym-quality machine - you will not get what you are looking for. If, however, you are looking for a basic functional rower without all the bells and whistles of high-end products, then this is probably the best deal you can get

I wonder why the other reviewer had leaking problems - perhaps a bad silicon seal?  I compared this in store to other products by thermos, no-names, etc, and it is one of the most solidly built food carry products I've ever seen or used.  I should have bought it years ago, and it would have saved hundreds of dollars via home-made lunches.  And jeez, the worry that every time you put tupperware/ziplock lunches in your bag, something is going to leak - how much is that worth to put to rest forever?  I used to wrap my food-carrying plastic wear in TWO plastic bags in case of inevitable leakage.  Never again.  This thing is solid.  

I must admit, it appeals to my guy side, (see my bachelor-style typical lunch and dinner, below) with the hammered green siding and shiny metal parts.  I think I sprouted a few extra hairs on my chest after I bought it.  It looks like something you might dig out of the basement in your parents' house, to which they would say, "Oh, that used to be your grandfather's, and I used it too.  It still works."  They could call it the Man-Jar.  (Ladies, don't be afraid, the thermal properties are gender-blind, and green will be in this fall)

If you got dumped recently by your girlfriend (or wife, or mom, or whatever), this jar can help you in your process of manly rediscovery.  

Despite the fact that spending money is something I generally discourage, this jar will actually help you save money in the long run. 

You could carry it home late at night on the subway as a weapon.  Heck, my cooking is a pretty dangerous payload.


Technical stuff:

I put a heated hamburger patty and microwaved (prev. frozen) vegetables into the container, with a thermometer.  Started at 180 deg. F, and arrived at 140 deg. F four hours later.  

I bought it before a 7-day road trip, living out of a cooler in the back of my car.  I didn't eat a SINGLE crappy fast-food meal, and I didn't spend a dollar on anything but gas.*  All healthy, pre-cooked, home-style, k-dog-style stuff.  Get yourself a Corning wear microwave bowl with a heavy-duty fridge plastic cover, and you have a home-cooked meal at every rest stop.

I've put boiling water in it, let it sit overnight, with the top off, and it was still warm in the morning.  



* And a hotel.  And a speeding ticket.  I musta been so excited to have this food bottle.  Damn ohio pigs

I have been using a headlight for years when I work night shift at the hospital.  When that light gave out, I bought this one.  I like having the three settings of brightness.  

Though I had a light on my bike handlebars, I wanted to get a light that would go on my helmet.  It came down to two choices and I went with the Aurora since I had been impressed with it at work. It turns out that it is brighter than the light I had on my handlebars that I paid more for just last summer.  Now I wish I had gotten an Aurora for my handlebars, also

     I was surprised at how good this worked with very little uncomfortableness while sleeping.  It didnt take much pressure on the toes
to be able to get up in the morning with very little pain on my heal.  Had problems for the last 4 months before the Thermoskin.  Have been using it 2 weeks now and am already trying to slowly get back to running.

The Cold Steel Spike Tanto is a lot of knife for a reasonable price.

It is viciously sharp and will remove arm hair quite easily.  It has a width across the spine of the blade that is unmatched by any knife its size I have ever seen.  Virtually indestructible.  The case is excellent if plain.  This knife leaves very wide wounds in steak; I think stitches would be the only way to close the wounds.

On the down side it doesn't hold an edge very long and its handle is very short and I wear a medium glove.

Overall this is a knife built for the sole purpose of self defense.  It is small to make it easily concealable and comes with its own neck chain.  It is a knife that won't let you down when the going gets tough, used in its intended purpose it should be virtually indestructible and wickedly efficient.

This is the perfect monitor for the average person.  The chest strap communicates with the machines at my gym so I don't have to look at the watch while using the machines.  While walking or jogging the watch provides a quick way to know your heart rate.  I haven't used the other features that are offered so I can't rate them, but it does everything that I wanted out of it when I purchased it

My treadmill came with a heart monitor of the same chest-strap type that only worked about half the time.  I never had a problem like that with this one, once it's on, it keeps reading until I take it off.  It's also compatible with all the treadmills/ellipticals/bikes at the gym, so I don't have to hold the handles any more

I am very happy with this watch. I really enjoy running and I wanted to learn how to get the best benefit from running without over-exertion and injury. The polar website said heart-rate monitoring helps with pace, getting the desired benefits from my run, and helped to reduce injury.

Pros: Works perfectly, immediately picked up by the gym equipment--no holding on required, setting 3 zones for warm-up, running, and cool down was a snap, the audible beeps help me to know when I'm slacking off or working too hard, the constant feedback is very motivating.

Cons: Not many here, however, the screen seems difficult to see in the sunshine. Will have to see the effect of that when spring comes !

I did a lot of shopping online and I liked the Polar M-61 ($130) best but I got this one because of the lower price ($80). The M-61 has more features and is more fashionable; so you may want to look at that one too

I've always loved Victorinox Swiss Army Knives, but I must admit that I when I purchased this one, I was not sure if I made the right choice, but my expectations were soon exceeded.  It was right before a trip to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in Minnesota, I had lost my other Swiss Army Knife (a Tinker), and I was looking for a versatile knife with a locking blade.  I did not need dozens of other tools for my pending stay in the wilderness.  I settled on this one because it was on sale, and I have not been disappointed.

The handle has a mild contour that made it very comfortable to handle.  For its size, it had just the right heft, but it was not too heavy to weigh down my shirt (where I kept it in my buttoned breast pocket).

The 4" locking blade worked wonderfully.  I could close it with either one or two hands.  When closing it, the blade pauses at the halfway point, reducing the risk of closing it on your fingers when closing it one-handed (that said, it does not eliminate all risk, so close the knife with one hand at your own risk).  During my recent canoe trip, I lost my fillet knife on a portage trail and was surprised that cleaning a 24" northern pike with this blade was quite painless (though it did take some skill).

Beyond the blade, I've always found the leather awl and the screwdriver handy, but the can opener blade is a primary reason why I prefer Victorinox Swiss Army knives over those produced by Wegner.

The knife shipped in a simple cardboard box.  A sheath or pouch would have been nice, but I was able to fabricate one with duct tape before my trip.  Since I kept it in my shirt pocket for most of my trip, the sheath wasn't necessary, but it is one accessory you should consider purchasing if you choose this knife.

I recommend getting one.  You will not be disappointed

Here's a secret for the uninformed: This is a very popular scale with people who never weigh a single fish. This is perhaps the best inexpensive package scale you can get, and if you're a regular eBay seller, it's one of the best tools you cna buy for making accurate weighings for estimating shipping charges. With this scale and a plastic bag, you can weigh any package, no matter how irregularly shaped, and get a weight accurate within an ounce or two. But remember- it's a secret

These flashlights are made in China.  That is not too surprising nowadays and is in no way an adverse comment on their quality and construction which seem to live up to what we might hope from a traditional American brand such as Smith & Wesson.  I have two of these and I expect them to last me the rest of my life.  (I am 60.)
 
A tad expensive (which is why only four stars) but small enough to be convenient, bright enough to be useful and efficient enough to be inexpensive to operate.

I bought these flashlights for use during blackouts but their convenience has me using them for illumination whenever I am fiddling around with cables behind the TV or under the office desk or inside the computer.  The small size means they are easy to hold in an armpit or in the same hand as another tool.

I also bought the red-LED version for use in the car so as not to affect night vision

Smith & Wesson is an American arms maker. The flashlight also got solid construction and reasonable weight. The more important aspect is that it uses two AA batteries, which are easy to find and economical. It came with two Energizer AA batteries. Three white LEDs are bright enough for general purposes. I keep it in my car's glove box.

I purchased this item as a gift for my mother.  She has a huge outdoor swimming pool and will use it as a changing room for all of her grandkids.  She's very happy that her new floors won't be ruined by everyone coming inside dripping wet to change after swimming

PowerBars were created out of necesity to be efficient, not to taste like a $2.50 gourmet treat similar alot of other bars that have since come out. If you want something that has a food like texture and tastes like food - eat food; like a steak, a piece of cake, or a banana. Power bars were made for energy in the 1980's; people who eat them now got used to them and now actually like them. Power Bars are practically synonymous with the term "energy bar" because they are the time honored benchmark. Try a Cliff Bar or a Snickers if you are looking for something tasty; when you get tired of those and long for something more in life, try a powerbar

Hey,

I decided to review some things I didn't buy off Amazon, but I have owned for sometime that are really great items: the kind I would buy again for sure if they were lost. I would say lost or broken, but Jansport has lifetime warranties! If anything happens to your backpack, all you have to do is mail it to Jansport with a note of the problem, they will fix it for FREE and send it back to you. They will even send you a card while they have it telling you it misses you and will be back soon. Overall, these are such great products, you just have to get a Jansport if you're thinking of a backpack.

Also, I am in a review writing competition with a friend of mine and if this review is helpful, which I hope it really is, I would love to have your yes vote!

With Care, 
Sa

If you have ever been caught at a check out desk or some place in need of a pen and no one has one, then this knife is for you.  

The other day I was at the check out line of the supermarket, and when I went to sign the credit slip, I couldn't as the casher has lost her pen.  I then whipped out my keychain with this on it and quickly signed the form and was on my way.

I highly recommend it for situations like this

I have bought over 20 of these knives.  I trim my nails, open packages, write notes, tighten screws, and strip wire (great for stripping wire).  You can buy replacement toothpicks and pens.  I put toothpicks in place of the twizzers.  I have never used the twizzers in 30 years.  I can use the toothpick a couple times a day.  I would love to see a thinner version with an LED, toothpick and pen. 

Airport security keeps taking my knives.  Remember to remove the pen and toothpick if they do take it.  The pen just pulls out. 

This is the best most used tool I have ever owned

Excellent product.  Great for home use as it folds up and slides right under the bed.  The height is adjustable and it breaks down and stores quickly. Very good quality materials for the price.  I have had my eye on one in the in-flight magazine when I travel but I saved a lot of money buying it here especially since they included free shipping

This Yakima roof rack system works great and I highly recommend it. I bought one for my Mazda 3 and have use it, along with a Yakima roof rack for 2 cross country ski trips (I live a Florida, skiing is far away). The rack hasn't shifted an inch and was relatively easy to install. Yakima has a product guide on their site to make sure you order the right pieces for your model car

I purchased this snorkel equipment for a vacation in Aruba and I used it for 4 days of snorkeling.  I had always rented snorkel gear before and this was the first time I decided to purchase a set.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  The fins are fantastic.  The design of this fin from US Divers with the split in the middle makes it extremely easy to move through the water - it's a great design feature!  The snorkel mask was comfortable and it never leaked.  The set also comes with a great blue and gray backpack that you can store all of your gear in

I bought one of these a while back to use as a day pack for hiking. I find it an absolutely great backpack. It has enough compartments for everything I need to carry as well as a ton of smaller pockets for nick knacks and smaller items.
I found I didn't need the waist belt and never used it as it doesn't do much. (It's not like your trying to get weight to your hips with a small pack like this anyways. I ended up cutting it off. It has a nice carry handle at the top built into the harness that makes it real easy to carry this pack or move it around with one hand when not wearing it.
The padding on the back is very comfortable, I haven't overloaded this pack yet, but with about 15-20 pounds, it's very easy to wear.
It has straps for a skateboard/snowboard, and while I've never used it for those, They make nice straps to lash things on if you wanted to. I also like the cell phone pocket, which I actually do use for a cell phone. I liked that so much that I zip tied my folding knife pocket exactly opposite it.
One downfall for me was the 2 side pockets. Usually used for water bottles . They are quite small. my nagaline 32 oz bottles won't fit in there, though no problem with smaller sizes. The pack is able to be used as a camel back, though I didn't see a bladder specifically made for it.

So in the end, I just bought another one of these for a friends birthday and I'm really impressed with it. I would definatly recomend this pack.

My daughter received this toy for Christmas and at seven weeks old, immediately loved it. My five-month old nephew also received one and loves it as well. It is easy for infants to grab and soft so they don't hurt themselves when they pull it towards their face and mouth. The colors are visually engaging and it has a "nice" rattle sound to it (loud enough to get the child's attention, not too loud to be an annoying toy). I recommend this toy for anyone shopping for a shower or birthday gift.

This is the same toy I was given as a shower gift except mine has a rubber duck in the middle. The women who gave it to me said she got it a a dollar store. Awesome toy for infants since it's light, easy to grip, and easy to bit. My son loved this toy for 2-3 months until he was old enough to move on to bigger heavier toys

This was the first toy my son picked up and put in his mouth at 3 months.  I think he liked it because it is very light and easy to grab on to.  He has found it so entertaining, and I especially appreciated that in his first months when there wasn't a lot I could do with him.  Now I try to include it with all of my baby shower gifts!

 deep gouges caused by feet of sofa where all finish was off  in  2   6"x9" areas were discovered during move-out; this product saved us from complete refinishing of otherwise gorgeous oak floors.
  simply rubbed the felt-like stick over the area, and the gouges seemed to "fill in"!
applied 2 more layers, and were amazed! couldn't tell where they were.
