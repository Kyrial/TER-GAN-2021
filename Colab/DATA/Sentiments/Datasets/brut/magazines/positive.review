I was sceptical at first. But after getting a few of the magazines I really got into the way they looked at the Whole Body health and didn't JUST focus on "body" exercises like most magazines

In Christmas of 2005 I decided I wanted the most interesting and best cooking magazines out there. But which ones to pick? After buying one here and there I found three that I absolutely love.

Saveur was one. The recipes are nice though some I wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole (ethnic ingredients that don't appeal to me). But the stories and the pictures... they aren't just amazing, they're astounding! Where National Geographic talks about certain things or places, Saveur takes you to different places and shows you what's there and how they eat. 

They showed me Ireland and I even made Colcannon (a mashed potato and cabbage dish) everyone loved it. I made a french dish last night that was amazing. It was a little time consuming but worth it!

I do have admit I was a little disappointed with my first issue I received from them with my subscription. It looked like a dog ate it then ran through the water with it. It's readable but I wasn't happy. They also promise two exclusive magazines for new subscribers. I've never seen them. But I have been getting my magazines and they look good. 

I was thinking about it the other night, my three magazines I picked... one was articles and recipes about healthy eating (Eating Well), one was easier recipes with no articles (Everyday Food), and then Saveur. If I could only pick one to keep... it would be Saveur. It's really that good of a read.

Saveur is a celebration of authentic cuisine with everything from Food Festivals to very easy-to-make recipes, like Blueberry Pudding. While there are a few book reviews for foodies to enjoy, the writing introduces cooks to international flavors and seasonal fare. Restaurants are also a feature as are gourmet cooking essentials. 

While reading you may discover a pastry shop or start to dream of making a recipe like Chicken Fried Steak. Yes, this very gourmet book has comfort food recipes as well as more complex recipes like the one for Olive Bread which actually only requires a minimum of bread making skills. 

After reading this magazine I'm normally in the mood to drizzle olive oil over just about anything I'm putting in the oven. The recipe for Stuffed Tomatoes and Summer Squash had me wishing it was October again and the recipe for Fig Jam reminded me of my childhood in Africa where we had a Fig Tree in the backyard. 

Saveur is filled with nostalgia, entertaining food adventures and delicious recipes. With Amazon's Gourmet food section, we can now find the ingredients to make many of the recipes in this magazine.

SAVEUR has been a guilty pleasure for me for some time. Guilty because it is hard to take serious a magazine with such a hoity sounding name... and admittedly some of the travel-and-food stories are just on the edge of self-indulgent, self-concious behaviour. They laugh at me at home (or used to) for reading it.

What makes it good is the content. The cover story each issue is usually a "destination" article, focused on a particular area and its food (cuisine is the wrong word here), written in a personal vein, with beautiful photos, and this is the heart of the magazine. But the other content is equally beautiful and it is amazing how many of the recipes actually are useful and have become mainstays for me... not just something good looking.

Hide the cover if you must, but I think this is the best "foodie" magazine

The high price is predominately due to the shipping costs as this magazine is produced in the United Kingdom.  A subscription over there runs about twenty bucks.  However, even with the added expense to get this delivered stateside, iCreate is a great looking magazine with excellent editorials.

Top-notch magazine and highly recommended.  Just wish Imagine Publishing would recognize the potential of this product and start producing this, as-well-as a few other of their excellent magazines, here in the States

Great magazine couldn't recommend it any higher for anyone starting out with macs. iCreate also introduced a great Pro section in 2005 to delveinto the workings of ProApps such as Final Cut Pro, Photoshop, mDVD Studio Pro etc. Now here's the thing, I'm wondering how the magazine can be available for subscription while the magazine was put on hold late last year. Me, or anyone I know with a subscription haven't recieved the mag for months, and there has been no contact from the people who handle the  subscription despite zillions of e-mails. So be careful, get the full story before you hand over any money!!!!!!!!!!!  check the web for similar storries, you will find the

You bet, this one is. There are only a few Mac oriented magazines out there and they all wish they could be this well written. This is a large format magazine and each issue is filled with a series of how-to articles that I consider the best written, best illustrated and easiest to follow. I can slog through some fairly dull reading but this is the magazine I would give to my wife / daughter / co-worker to explain how to use iChat, hook up an iSight camera, customize iCal, get started with Safari and so on. 

They review many new software tittles and the latest hardware goodies. Since it is a magazine, the reviews are very current. Each issue comes with a CD and they are starting to include pdf copies of prior issues, great for reference

I subscribe to all of the home and garden magazines and Southern Accents is the best, bar none.  The houses featured are absolutely dreamy--the photography is gorgeous--and while the magazine doesn't offer how-to decorating ideas, there is so much inspiration.  I find it to be intelligently written...which is rare in a decorating magazine. The articles on antiques are particularly informative.  This magazine will appeal to anyone who is interested in beautiful, classic design--whether or not you live in the South

As an interior design student, I find this magazine a wonderful source of inspiration, variety, and creativity.  This magazine is more about art and design than advice on "do it yourself" decorating or cheap furniture finds, so:

do NOT subscribe to this if you are expecting the latter or else you will be sorely disappointed and become one of the reviewers who give one-two star reviews here because they had expected this magazine to have a different, more practical purpose

The articles range from architecture, to renovated homes, to specific garden types to the average home owner. I found so many great ideas and inspiration in this magazine as well. The pictures are great and I find myself tearing things out every month!

Fantastic for anyone interested in design, art, or interior decorating

I've read The New Yorker since 1963 and though it seemed a better magazine then, it is still a very good magazine now. As magazines go, it may even be one of the best this nation has ever published.

For good writing, reporting, cartoons, and opinion one can do no better than this well known magazine. And their occasional special issues offer abundant pages that double their weekly issue. I don't believe any issue in all the years I've read it hasn't had at least a couple items of interest, with some of the issues being read from front cover to back.

Try a copy, it might just be for you.

Although I often disagree with the 'New Yorker' politically and find the writing of Seymour Hersh offensive I believe that the 'New Yorker' publishes exceptionally fine pieces of non- fiction. I stress the non- fiction because this is what interests me in 'the New Yorker now'.Once it was the fiction of Salinger, Singer, of S.J. Perelman. But in recent years it has been the writing of Malcolm Gladwell, Adam Gopin and a number of others. 
This is without speaking of the special feeling of class the New Yorker gives, its still topnotch cartoons, the 'On the Town' feature, and the first-rate 'Talk of the Town ' calendar

I have read this magazine on and off for a several years and wanted to add my 2 cents.  Yes, the magazine does have many ads for business opportunities.  But this is exactly something I want to read and evaluate, the marketplace of business opportunities.  Many of these are franchise opportunities, which is exactly where the first time entrepreneur should start.  The articles are generally well written and many will obviously be useful, but not all.  The value of each article often depends on where you are in the business creation process.  It was not until I read the E-Myth Revisited that I understood the value of these franchises.  This magazine slices and dices the franchises by many metrics to help you find one where you are most likely to both succeed and be happy.  The magazine is easily worth more than the price to any person seriously starting or building a small enterprise.  Hope this has been helpful to the entrepreneurs out there

It's true that Entrepreneur mag is loaded with ads--but those ads can be interesting in themselves. I always find it fascinating to see what ads pop and what ads are junk--and it's easy to see the difference. This is an opportunity to develop your own advertising strategy! 

As for the content, there is certainly room for improvement. I personally enjoy the entrepreneur profiles, though I wish they were longer. I would like to see more meat here.

Having been in business for several years now, I find the most value in this magazine comes from the front section where they list interesting tips, new products, and survey results. Not a month goes by that I don't bookmark a page so I can follow up on a new product or check out a website mentioned in a short piece.
For that alone, the low subscription price is worth the investment.

There is a lot of information on franchising, which is great for those interested in this business model. Though this is not my personal cup of tea, I still find it interesting to read the lists of franchises and notice the trends in popularity. Who knew there were so many pet service franchises available!

Sure, it could use more real-world advice, but I still consider this one of the best general magazines available for entrepreneurs. Not every topic can appeal to every reader since we all run different kinds of businesses and seek different information. If you're looking for something more specific to your industry, a trade magazine would make more sense. But I still recommend you keep your Entrepreneur mag too so you can keep an eye on the climate of the small biz world.

I've been playing video games since my Atari 2600 (and my lucky neighbors CalicoVision) and I'm happy to say that someone who grew up around the same time decided to start a magazine. At Play they go out of their way to show games that they think are great but that are never going to get any press anywhere else. Also, since the mid-1990's I've been into anime but have only been able to go by word of mouth or more recently by what I see on TV (thank you anime and cartoon network). Now I have play to read, as it has extensive, 20-30 pages of quality anime reviews. 

The reviewers are more than competent and may actually posses brains, unlike the reviewers in most other game magazines. They realize that their reader is not only the thirteen year old Grand-Theft, Tony Hawk player but also people like me who need humor and intelligence in my reading material.

Finally, the quality of printing and lamination on the pages will make you want to keep each one forever and I have reread and consulted past issues over and over.

Thank you Play for giving me something other than Bills to pull out of my mail box.

 I THOUGHT MY FIRST ISSUE OF YOUR MAGAZINE WAS A LITTLE SPARSE. IT WAS A VERY THIN ISSUE. THE MODELS WERE BEAUTIFUL. THIS WAS GOOD.BUT YOU KNOWIF YOU WOULD INCLUDE MORE IN DEPTH ARTICLESSUCH AS REALLY IN DEPTH STUFF ABOUT SKIN AND HAIR. LIKE I SAID BEFORE AGING SKIN NEEDS MORE DONE TO IT AND SOME THINGS LIKE MICRO-DERMABRASION COULD BE HELPFUL. ALSO 8 GLASSES A WATER A DAY IS THE MOST HELPFUL THING A WOMAN COULD DO FOR HERSELF. BESIDE PLASTIC SURGERY,THERES NOT MUCH FOR THEM TO DO. BUT I WILL SAYTHIS, TO ENLARGE LIPS I PUT A VITAMIN E CAPSULE ON MY LIPS, AND THEN HONEY AND THEN A GOOD LIP MOISTURIZER AND LEAVE IT ON OVERNIGHT. IT DOEES MAKE THE LIPS PLUMPER. ALSO I USE BABY POWDER ON MY FACE AS A FACE POWDER. SOMETIMES I USE THIS JUST ON MY NOSE AND CHIN. SOMETIMES I USE HALF MAYONAISE AND  CONDITIONER AND MIX THEM TOGETHER TO MAKE THE MAYONAISE SMELL BETTER ON THE HAIR. SOMETIMES I USE VITAMIN OIL IN MY BATH WATER SUCH AS VITAMIN E A PERSON CAN BUY THIS AT THE DOLLAR STORE.  IM NOT RICH BUT I DO SOME THINGS TO HELP THE WAY I LOOK AT  MY AGE. THEN YOU COULD INCLUDE PICTURES OF MOUNTAINS AND RIVERS AND STORIES OF PEOPLE .  THEN YOU COULD HAVE ARTICLES ON CELEBRITIES LIKE FRANK CONVERSE,ROBERT BLAKE,REALLY INTERESTING ONES LIKE THAT. PAUL NEWMAN HAS ALWAYS GOT SOMETHING TO SAY INTERESTING. ALSO WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO ACTOR RICHARD HATCH WHO STARRED IN THE HITCHHIKERS?  someone told  me the other day that the most handsome actor there was or is was yul brynner. i didnt see that as i should. i dont know if you agree with that or not but it would be interesting to see a profile of the way he lived .i like brad pitt and those people are always great. i love jennifer anniston because she she is higher up than most women in her thoughts and actions.angelina jolie i   really like too beacause women do like these women. i miss johnny carson and they really need to find someone to replace him. yes there is people like that still in the world. ive found some of them. well thank you

Harper's is easily my second favorite fashion magazine, second only to InStyle.  It is great and packed with great fashion.  It actually does have some good articles too that I thoroughly enjoy reading.  (The articles are MUCH better than the ones in Elle.)  If you can only get one sub, get InStyle.  If you can get two, get InStyle and Harper's Bazaar.  It is well-worth the money

Harper's Bazaar is the very best fashion and high style magazine out there, nothing compared to the always disappointing Vogue. Better fashions, editorials, articles that I actually want to read and keepsake editions that are just classics. The true bible if you want to be in style

I watch CNN, too.  When there is a big story, I get parts of it on CNN, then Newsweek comes and it fills in with a larger story, the bigger picture in a way that I understand.  Then I relate to other news sources as a more informed listener/reader.
If it in fact has a liberal bias, I have not detected it, but I tend to have a slightly liberal bias myself, so I can't speak to that.  
I buy Time on the newstand when there is something that seems to be particularly well covered in Time. I do not consider Newsweek lesser.  I used to take Time years ago.  Now I prefer Newsweek.  
The only complaint I might have is that both magazines seem to be having more "magazine", or feature type stories, that I do not see as "news" and am not interested in.  I think that is driven by these magazines (both Time and Newsweek do it) attempt to find out what works in this expanding world of media.
Ninety percent of those human interest subjects are not my interest and that annoys me.  But the few that speak to me, yes, I will buy a magazine for that.  For instance if Time has a good article on the older groups of people in America, I will buy that single issue.  At the same time I am usually disappointed in whatever is featured in either magazine if it is not news driven.
Newsweek has been my news magazine that comes in the mail for years.  For me, it remains my choice.

Still nowhere near as technical as the web reviews
</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
Print magazines are behind current news by about 3-4 months. The websites have news about new digital cameras instantenously. The print magazines are destined to be 3-4 months behind. If you are looking for the latest news, you will get them tape-delayed if you only read magazines.

However, this magazine goes more in depth than some other ...popular magazines. The reviews are actually 4-5 pages long, not one-page politically correct recaps of the feature lists. (Still nowhere near as technical as the web reviews).

Having said all that, and understanding the limitations of print magazines, this is a good, affordable magazine to read if you are interested in digital photography. It has some useful and helpful information, reasonable reviews, and some interesting articles

After reading several digital photography books, and going to grad school classes... I found this magazine to be far superior to anything published in this country.  There are many articles on artists, workshop-type tutorials, as well as the latest and most fantastic hardware and software for the digital fan.  I believe this magazine has something for everyone... from beginner to more advanced at relatively low cost.  In addition, I have found two other British publications, Digital Camera World, and Digital Photography Techniques (both at www.dcmag.co.uk), that I would strongly recommend for those who can afford them

This magazine does a great job of featuring good articles at the beginning and then breaking down events you might want to do in New York City that week. The magazine is organized into various categories that are color coded so that when you get it, you can just skip to the section you're interested in. There's a whole city out there to discover and TONY can help point you in the right direction

Ah, the men's magazine. So many out there, where to draw the line when it comes to subscribing? Ultimately it boils down to what is worth the money you are shelling out, and for me, FHM is a cut above the rest for the following reasons.

1. Articles are more intelligently written, less sophmoric, and delve on a wider array of issues.

2. Paper quality is high glossy and sturdy, while other magazines feel like cheap pieces of newspaper by comparison. Paper feels like the same paper used by Playboy.

3. Quality of women featured. FHM has by far a higher quality of women. Maxim tends to pull from a rung lower on the quality ladder, while FHM features beautiful, sexy, intelligent, and funny women whose interviews are actually readable.

4. FHM Top 100 Women Special. Wow. Worth the money right there.

[...]
Only negative with subscriptions is that these companies will send you last month's issue and count that as one of your 12 issues. That is annoying

 This magazine is one of the alltime best mags for men. It has everything you want, including hot babes, cars, gadgets, and sexy bikinis. It is also very cool in that it can turn you on to some cool stuff, like the new watches they showed by Fossil and DKNY, and some excellent Martini recipes, and then they turned me on to a DVD called "NEW SEX NOW" 
 which has greatly enhanced my reputation with the ladies.

I, for one, am hooked.

I am a huge Nelson fan and thought I was the only one left; until I visited their website www.thenelsonbrothers.com. They are as hot as ever! Since "After the Rain" they have released six more Cd's. I highly recommend the "Brother Harmony" Cd, or the "Like Father Like Sons" Cd, where they honor their late great father, Rick Nelson, by bringing back his music. 

They are currently available to come to your hometown and put on a performance that will leave you wanting more. To contact information on booking them for your area, please contact them at
www.nelsontourinfo.com. Hey ... it's an awesome experience to see them in action.

In Touch is a weekly glossy magazines that retails at newstands for $1.99.  It is very similar to Star and Us Weekly.  They offer fodder on the Hollywood flavor of the moment, so expect lots of stories about Julia Roberts, Britney Spears, Brad Pitt, Jenifer Aniston, J.Lo and the usual suspects.  It is very worth the newstand price.  They rarely, if ever have human interest stories, most of the stories are all about celebrities, style, make-up, or fashion. They also have contests some times. A lot of times I notice they run the same stories and pictures as Us Weekly so if I had to choose between In Touch and Us Weekly 1 year subscription is less I would choose Us because it still seems like they get more exclusive stories that In Touch.  Also, some of the news they run sometimes is weeks old, I often think they end up filling space close to print time. It's an okay magazine an worth the cover price

Touchstone features articles, editorials, book reviews and other material from the perspective of Protestant (both mainline and evangelical), Catholic and Orthodox Christians who hold to traditional, orthodox understandings of Christian morality.  It tackles the tough issues of our time both in scholarly articles and practical advice for parents who must raise children to be faithful in a post-Christian culture.  While it does not seek a false ecumenicalism which demands unity at all cost (see the July/August 2003 issue on "Christian Unity & the Divisions we must Sustain"), it also recognizes that orthodox believers of all three major branches of Christianity must work together on moral issues on which we all agree.

The publisher, the St. James Fellowship, also produces an excellent devotional guide: The St. James Daily Devotional Guide for the Christian Year, available by subscription though [...]

Touchstone is one of the better magazines/journals to discuss and debate the meaning of the mind and heart in the contemporary world by standing on the shoulders of those who have struggled with this perennial question in the past. The editors, numerous in number, are Orthodox, Roman, and Protestant Christians who take seriously the creeds and scriptures of the Church. In other words, they realize that Tradition is the glue that holds the Church together, and by extension, sanitizes and sanctifies culture.

First Things is also an excellent journal that you will want to check out as well. Enjoy!

This is one of the best dog magazines of all time. The issues just keep getting better and better. This magazine goes beyond purebreds and honors mixed-breeds as well. It has wonderful rescue-related stories.

One of the other reviewers compared the quality of the articles in this magazine with that of NPR. That comparison really opened my eyes as I have for years enjoyed and appreciated the quality and fairness of the information provided by NPR.

Conde Nast Traveler is a magazine for the wealthy or the want-a-bees.  The magazine is geared mostly to North America and Europe.  It tells where to eat, shop or be seen on the two continents.  For example, an article will inform the reader of a new five-star Sushi restaurant in Florence, Italy.  Thus, if you plan to travel to Florence for Sushi (not Michelangelo), this is the magazine for you.  It is a great coffee table magazine for the armchair traveler, for the pictures are gorgeous.

this is a great travel magazine - wonderful pictures and stories.  it is also much cheaper than the equally wonderful travel+leisure, so that makes conde nast traveler a better deal.  be aware though, the items in this magazine are not very cheap, unfortunately.  go with another magazine (arthur frommer's budget travel) if you want to find travel baragains

I was in the Travel Industry for years, and found CN to be an excellent, albeit brief source of continually updated information on destinations, and all other aspects of travel, whether upscale or backpack. Yes, it is not encyclopaedic, and yes it is chock full of adverts. However, the latter brings the cost of publication, no doubt, and the former allows CN to cover a wide array of topics in each issue. Their travel product ratings are next to none, and shortlists the selection process, allowing the consumer to make more intelligent and cost conscious purchasing decisions

Nice replacement for my Oprah Magazine.
Like the concise and to the point articles.  Good suggestions sprinkled in magazine.  Very heavy with the advertisements...but then the ads rip out quickly, leaving a more simple Real Simple read.

"As we grow older and realize more clearly the limitations of human happiness, we come to see that the only real and abiding pleasure in life is to give pleasure to other people." ~P.G. Wodehouse, Something New

Creative advertising (love the GE firefly ad), practical advice for your home and luxurious perfumes all blend effortlessly throughout the pages of Real Simple. There I was wondering when I should replace a down comforter and this magazine had the answer. They also have some lovely quotes and ideas for decorating your home with Liz Claiborne home items, like the lovely bedding and towels. 

The do it yourself features are fun with ideas like a hostess gift you make up yourself with a basket and candles. Loved the articles like "organizing your recipes; 8 foolproof methods." But their advice on tossing cookbook in favor of just keeping a few recipes! Hello. There are some cookbooks you definitely want to keep. 

They always seem to put a spin on old favorites, like the modern cheesecake that is gourmet and elegant. The applesauce cake in the November issue uses chunky applesauce so people might think you spent all that time chopping apples.

I am not a big magazine reader -- never have been, never really had time to!  However, a friend of mine at work kept bringing me copies of this magazine to read...after falling in love every time read it I finally I had to get a subscription of my own!

This magazine covers everything! It's got tips for life, cooking, decorating, organzing, and getting the best deal for your money.  A lot of the stuff in here -- shortcut cooking ideas, for instance, are stuff that I use and apply to my normal life.

For example: the July 2006 issue has a dessert shortcut for peach cobbler.  The result of that recipe was a WONDERFUL dessert for my family of four that took me... less than 15 minutes to prepare and tasted great!  

They don't endorse products NEARLY to the same degree that most magazines do, and when they do it's in an article where they had comparisons done...always a recommendation, and usually more than one.  The important thing here is they don't say "buy this product" they say "buy products that have such and such feature, make sure it has this in it for silky smooth hair, and oh here's an example of what we're talking about."  They make you an informed shopper instead of just throwing products at you withotu reason or rhyme.

So, in conclusion, if you're like me and can use a few extra ideas about EVERYTHING in your life...this is a great magazine.  The information is helpful, applicable to normal everyday life...and it's not so full of ads that you want to choke the advertisers

This magazine compares favorably to &quot;American Heritage&quot; with its interesting and accessible but well-researched accounts of the past. Each issue focuses on a person (I just read the story of Thomas Aquinas--and hadn't realized his fascinating interaction with Muslims) or a movement (The Huguenots, who's sad history led to their dispersal from France to all over the world--including the Revere family moving to Massachusetts). All in all, an intriguing glimpse at how Christians of the past continue to influence us today

What I like about this magazine is that the articles are unique and informative.  I have bought the last three issues and can't wait for the next one.   This magazine covers equipment in a current mode rather than a 6 months to a year behind style so familiar with many of the other photography magazines.  
This magazine provides me some much needed diversion because it captures my attention each time I have picked one up.  Every article is telling me about or showing me how to implement the lastest techniques from the best photographers in the industry.  
At the beginning of this year I noticed  that some of the  "popular" or "modern"  "digital review" magazines were running the same old head to head comparisons of  consumer cameras that have been out for the better part of a year now. 
I need to see the technology  that is cutting edge or even around the corner.  
So far this magazine is giving me the best bang for my buck.
Good luck

After having subscribed to Peterson's Photographic for several years, I'm now hooked on this new magazine and am going to let the old subscription lapse. I've gotten tired of all the articles targeted at beginners. Digital Photo Pro digs into the meat of photography a little deeper. Some examples of articles which I've enjoyed are discussions of how digial imaging sensors work and how ink jet printers work. In the most recent issue is a good article on using the unsharp mask in Photoshop. Also, I've enjoyed the large section on new products in each issue.

One caveat is that there is some nudity. You may or may not find this objectionable (my wife is in the former category :). Also, there is usually an article on glamour photography or glamour photographers in each issue. Even if this isn't your cup of tea, there is still good stuff to learn in those articles.

The magazine is beautifully published with very high quality paper and printing. It's also nice and big.

On any list of pure English-language business reportage, BARRON'S would figure in the top ten. This newspaper-style weekly compiles more numbers than just about any other publication.

Though 'fluff' is not a word commonly associated with the Wall Street Journal, think of BARRON'S as 'WSJ without the fluff'.  That's how focused it is.

Electronic availability of business numbers has pushed BARRON'S off the 'must read' list, though it has its guild of old faithful readers who consider nothing else its equal. Published by Dow Jones, it is as focused on Wall Street as any publication could be.

Business people appreciate its 'Review  & Preview' section, which at a glance brings a reader up to speed on last week's business news leaders and next week's announcement and world holidays affecting business.

WSJ and the Economist will give you more extensive analysis.

Without slighting its columns and feature articles, BARRON'S is for the pure numbers guys and gals among us. They're all in here. Honest

First off, most people don't buy this magazine in order to salivate over what they don't have but desperately want--at least, I don't.  This magazine is a wonderful inspiration for those of us who are interested in making the most of our home and free time.  Isn't our home supposed to be a haven?  Someplace to return to from the hustle, bustle and craziness of the day and just relax and spend time making memories and creating joy in our lives and of those we love.  This magazine simply caters to people with that ethic.  It's always full of ideas--both trendy and traditional.  It's not full of "BUY, BUY, BUY!" hyper-consumerist propoganda--it simply presents current trends and new ideas to keep your haven fresh and fun.  Anyone with a lick of sense and an ounce of self-respect doesn't turn to home magazines looking to be led, like a sheep, into the latest buying frenzy.  Most of us are smart enough to flip through the pages and get ideas of things we like and then find clever, inexpensive ways to incorporate them into our own lives--on our own budget.  This magazine is always full of beautiful pictures, great advice, and even terrific information about how and where to find bargains.  Mainly, though, it's about making the most of what you've got, and using your free-time to truly enjoy life to its fullest.  Don't fall for the neosocialist rhetoric of the first review.  This magazine is worth every penny

Looking for a nice well-rounded magazine with the major focus on contemporary interior design? Miss superb printing quality, clean European lines, meticulous attention to details? You've got it all in this magazine. After moving here in the US from a major European capital, I have frankly missed a good magazine with the latest trends in metropolitan interior design. Architectural digest is great if you live in a grand mansion in Ladue, but what if you want simple and elegant functionality of a nicely designed European apartment or loft in your typical suburban house. This magazine has been a delight to read (nice coffee table edition too). It has been a source of ideas and inspiration for me for several years now. Recommend highly

From a subscription point of view (about $12/yr directly) this magazie is a decent value.  While half the information is fluff (looking back - 15 years of innovation, etc.) there is some timely relevant information hard to find easily in a consolidated way.  The focus is not just on laptops but mobile solutions - this includes peripherals, PDAs, mobile phones among others.  There is some opinion (RIAA vs Sirius) but the focus seems to be vendor/advertiser driven.

For example, the cover story of the Mar 2006 issue is on First Four Core Duo notebooks.  They review Centrino Duo notebooks from Acer, Dell, Gateway and HP.  They run benchmark tests and provide charts, etc.  Fairly useful info.  Except they don't give the information consistently.  The weight of Dell laptop is not even mentioned while those of others is.  They do mention a few cons for each notebook but do it gently without a strong opinion. Two of the four systems reviewed are selected as Editors' Choice. The other two still are rated well.   There is no single table that compares them all in a single view.  You get the feeling, they were trying to please the advertisers and avoided any direct head-on comparision between multiple products.

I disagree with their choices as well.  How could the Editors' choice be a 6.6lbs laptop from Acer that has an average battery life just because it offers some value?

In the same Mar 2006, there is a review of Windows Treo 700W; a showdown between slim   phones Moto RAZR V3c and Samsung MM-A900; a short test of Nokia's pocket Internet Appliance and Kodak's first dual-lens digicam; Wifi routers; list of restaurants for business  travelers;   etc.

For a $1/month, I recommend this to anyone who travels a lot and is looking for a quick update on the mobile computing world.  If you want in-depth technical info, stick to Toms Hardware or other web sites

Laptop Magazine is an excellent resource for the mobile professional.  The staff has done a great job of reviewing products relevant to those individuals attached to their laptops and related gadgets. Despite the name, the magazine is not merely about laptops but also the tools and strategies for the peripatetic white-collar worker.

With information on laptops, mobile phones, hotels and airlines, Laptop Magazine is loaded with great insights. Its layout is excellent as it appears far less cluttered than other computer magazines - much like how the Harvard Business Review differs from Star Magazine.  Yet, it is a bit light on specific computer tasks and tweaking.  This may be due to the demographic of the audience, which is most likely a collection of mid-level executives and sales professionals instead of hands-on technology gurus.   As such, the magazine is well worth the read as it will certainly save time with your work, travel, and technology purchases in the future.


Pros:
Excellent product information
Great organization and layout


Cons
Light on nuts and bolts computer technology
No concise source of the laptop reviews (i.e. like Motor Trend has a summary of tests with dates and results with every magazine).

I've been to a lot of concerts, met a lot of bands, seen a lot of hype, seen a lot of scandal. This magazine is pretty much the best source of any up-and-coming band that you may be hearing on the radio or seeing on MTV.
Not only is SPIN the best magazine for music for "kids my age (22)" but the picture quality is some of the best quality that I have seen in any magazine. I have framed pages out of previous spin magazines, because they were pictures I wanted to keep forever. I would recommend spin magazine to any fan of indie rock especially. Death cab for cutie, the shins, and the flamming lips are just some of the bands that are talked about in SPIN magazine monthly. SPIN magazine does include some rap/hip-hop music that I try to avoid but the indie-rock and rock band information that I receive is some of the best.

As an aging,53,appreciator of music,I find Paste to be a welcome read every time it shows up in my mailbox.Granted- I do not know every artist mentioned in the magazine nor do I care to, but the artists I do follow are treated with respect and with a sense of genuine interest! The CD that comes with the magazine will help you decide beforehand whether or not to purchase that Winterpills or Eddie Spaghetti CD!As previously mentioned,in another review, the print can be small and my reading glasses are always nearby!

I've been subscribing to Paste for over a year now, and it's a great magazine. I agree with what others have said about the writing: the interviewers often seem in love with their subjects and deal with the musicians as fans instead of as journalists. There are tons of reviews in each issue on a wide variety of bands and music, and the sampler CD and DVD are worth the subscription price all by themselves. It's a great way to listen to bands that you would never have heard otherwise. If you love music and are spending a small fortune on CDs, this magazine is for you. My only real criticism of the magazine is that it is very text heavy, with tons of small print jammed onto each page, often with a background picture/design behind the words, which makes it a chore to read. I would love to see larger print and less eye junk on the pages. Then again, I'm closing in on 40 so younger eyes may not find it as problematic

I read the Nation for its poetry, Katha Pollitt and takes on the news.  It's a left wing magazine.  I don't understand the people who criticize it for being liberal and expect "objectivity". Humans have opinions and viewpoints. Even Time magazine and the National Review have viewpoints.

The author of the Declaration of Independence and promoter of a bill of rights for the U.S. Constitution, Thomas Jefferson once wrote: "I read no newspaper now but Ritchie's, and in that chiefly the advertisements, for they contain the only truths to be relied on in a newspaper." [Letter to Nathaniel Macon, January 12, 1819]

The Nation is not a newspaper. Rather it is a weekly compilation of informed opinion and investigative reportage that reports what the main stream press and infotainment TV doesn't dare to. Those Americans whose minds have been addled by a steady stream of ideological propaganda and lies call The Nation "left wing," "liberal," "radical," etc., etc. 

Plato had written 2,300 years ago his Allegory of the Cave: "Behold! human beings living in an underground den, which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching all along the den; here they have been from their childhood, and have their legs and necks chained so that they cannot move, and can only see before them, being prevented by the chains from turning round their heads." Plato's "punchline" was "...  And if he is compelled to look straight at the light, will he not have a pain in his eyes which will make him turn away to take refuge in the objects of vision which he can see, and which he will conceive to be in reality clearer than the things which are now being shown to him?"

And so, dear reader The Nation is filled with sunlight that too many Americans cannot stand to look into directly. It is much less painful for them simply to say: "... the Nation's political bias is so far to the Left that it repeatedly errors in its evaluations of the American and world - situation."

For those who wish to know the simple truth of what is going on in America and the world read The Nation. It prints the patriotic, incisive truth.

I have been subscribing to this magazine for years, and it is a very special part of my weekly regimen. In fact, every Monday or Tuesday I start to feel a pang of something being 'missing' if I haven't yet read that week's issue. As I explained to my daughter this summer, I do not read every word, every page, or every article. But I do flip through every page and read whatever interests me or catches my attention. Alot of it is just to look at the pictures and read the captions. Every issue usually contains at least a few articles that I read in their entirety -- usually in the business and lifestyle sections -- and I often pick up tips on good books, music, and movies from it. A very solid subscription. A way of life, actually

I personally have always enjoyed reading Time magazine long before I became politically aware. I started reading this magazine since I was in my adolescence.Do I think it is liberal biased as some of the other reviewers claims that it is? I don't know and I don't care. I don't read it from a particular point of view. Some of the cover stories in the past may be highly questionable given how shallow they might be but I don't take it personally. One of the best articles I have read in a long time is the issue on high school drop outs. I thought that was quite thought provoking. I didn't think much of the 100 most influential people in the world list. Katie Couric?! C'mon. That woman is to hard journalism as Paris Hilton is to music. I won't even get into Rachel Ray. If people think Time Magazine is too liberal, then go read the National Review. I don't see Time as hard journalism. Half the stuff they publish is fluff pieces.

New York magazine is the flag bearer for "New York is the Center of the Universe" belief.  It meets this goal in dishing up news, gossip, reviews and viewpoints on a weekly basis.  (How else can one get away with call shopping Strategy?)  The magazine succeeds because behind the snobbery (example: An article on the 2nd best cities in the world) it turns up the restaurants, stories and culture that make NYC such a fantabulous place.  It's worth diminishes rapidly, though, the further one gets from the Big Apple

I love the City. Its particular rhythm and energy is like no other place in the world. 'New York Magazine' captures some of this , and works to be fashionable and fast, glossy and up-to- date, stylish and hip( If that is still the word.)
I sort of like some of this, but a lot of it seems to me trivial and idiotic. And a lot of the trendy stuff is just way out of my league.
But 'New York' often has wonderful writing. I cite here James Atlas as a particularly good contributor. And it tells you things about the City no other magazine does. Some of those things old conservative me will not read. 
But at times there are pieces here that cannot only be 'fun' but give a real feeling why the Big Apple is still the 'Empire State Building( or Flatiron Building) of all the great cities

Long time MSL subscriber.  I get out my dec, dec/jan issues every holiday season to see what works for ornaments and decorations and such.  I loved the cookie issue last year, definite keeper.  Her projects involve time and materials, but you end up with something that will last, and instructions are generally very clear.  I've seen that since her trial/jail, the high end advertisors have almost entirely backed out, which means adds for average joes, like me.  I really appreciate the depth that the mag goes into a certain subject, even if its not a particular fave of mine. 
I haven't really watched the Martha show much, I really enjoyed the original MSL show she started with.  Sometimes I get annoyed that the materials seem very exclusive to New York and similiar, but c'est la vie

American Spectator Mag. is an Oasis of true conservatism in this jungle of Liberalism!  Mr. Emitt Tyrell has got to be THE coolest guy to ever put together a magazine.  The information is fantastic, the intellect captivating. I highly reccommend it to everyone

The American Spectator offers an eloquent and often humorous conservative viewpoint on the more pressing political and cultural issues facing the world today.  The emphasis here is "conservatism", not "Republicanism" as TAS is often highly critical of GOP politics and policies that stray from conservative ideals.

Publications like TAS counter the insidious, tendentious underpinings of the mainstream media, hollywood, and the mistake that is the United Nations.  I recommend you at least give it a look. Samples of its content can be found at www.spectator.or

I've been a subscriber for several years now.  I was trying to decide between maxim and stuff.  I chose maxim because the info is very random and entertaining (i.e. how to do doughnuts in your car, ect.)  They do have some photos of actors and such, but many were of people from other countries and just other pretty girls you may have never heard of... I would suggest this magazine

This is *the* magazine dedicated to advanced topics on the Windows NT series (NT, 2000 and XP).  As the most popular and one of the best operating systems, Windows NT series is incredibly complicated, and this magazine, issue after issue as well as on its cluttered website, gives you lots of detailed information.  A lot of the contributors are respected programmers who really know Windows internals.  You also get the "inside" view of Microsoft managers and developers from time to time.  This is just one incredible resource for expert Windows uers.  (After all, even an expert still has a lot to learn.)

Now, this is going to make Amazon mad: if you subscribe on Windows IT Pro website, you save another $10 plus you get free access to their entire article archive

I started reading the Economist after a recommendation from a professor during my undergrad years.  That was 9 years ago.  
Reason blended with wit and intelligence, the articles in the Economist are a perfect antidote to the often insipid stuff put out by conventional newspapers.  Once I get my weekly edition, you couldn't blow-torch it out of my hands (my wife has tried).
The Economist is one of the few newspapers that has consistently defended the classical liberal perspective.  Free markets, civil liberties, and skepticism of those in power.  In my opinion, it has no competitors.  I couldn't rate it highly enough

Most newsmagazines are dumbed down in both intellectual rigor and political bite.  This is the only weekly newsmag I can stand to read, and I love to read it.  US news is a grab bag of topics, international is excellent (vs. other US sources of news), finance & business is excellent, science is a grab bag, books & arts is quite good, and the periodic special reports are great.  Cheeky and clear, a delight to read.  Bring your skepticism, though, because the reporters & columnists are not shy about taking a position, and you have to be ready to grapple and form your own opinion.

Too often in America we are fed news by deceiving journalists (such as those that work for Fox News). The Economist offers news with an agenda that does not always correspond to America's. It is a great resource for furthering ones knowledge of the world, from politics to economics to science to the arts. Best of all, the articles (except for the Special Report) are concise, allowing for an easy read.

Although I have yet to subscribe to Aperture, what I've heard and what little I've seen advertised in one of Sally Mann's famous publications is enough to arouse my interest, and I can't wait to partake of a first issue of 'Aperture'.  Feedback from other members is always anticipated and welcomed

Aperture is indeed the preeminent art photography magazine, and consistently has enough good material to warrant a subscription independent of its clout.  Although ostensively devoted to art photography, many of the spreads are essentially photojournalism.

If you are primarily interested in just art photography, and can subscribe only to one magazine, I would suggest "Blind Spot"

This newsletter is a great resource for dog people.  The articles are well researched, detailed, and best of all, applicable.  I keep them in a binder, and often refer back to earlier issues if I have a health or training concern about my dogs (and have been known to share them with friends.)  Both the positive training and the holisitic health information is great.  I definitely recommend this newsletter to anyone who loves their dogs.

I've received The Whole Dog Journal for the past year.  I have found it to be refreshing as it has no advertisements.  It's pure holistic news, information, health, nutrition, training, food testing, and anything else pertaining to DOGS!  I would recommend this magazine to new dog owners as well as seasoned.  One thing about the world of dogs is that it is ever changing.  It's not always easy to get information that is up-to-date, helpful, and necessary.  With The Whole Dog Journal one can be certain that they will have the best knowledge

The Whole Dog Journal should be mandatory for anyone that loves their dog. The information found in this magazine is the best I have ever seen regarding the health and happiness of any dog.  The editor and contributing writers are the best in the dog world. They tell the whole truth about dogs that you will not find anywhere. And this information can and has been lifesaving. You will not find better information anywhere

I'll agree with everyone else and say that this magazine probably does need a new name. However, I love all the other features in the magazine! It is Cooking Light, but there is so much more - always an article on a travel destination, an article on beauty, and an article on a sport, as well as other constants. The theme of the magazine is total healthy living, incorporating health issues and exercise as well as healthy food, though I do think that it is mostly a food magazine. I gave it four stars because while the recipies do look good, some of the ingredients are a bit too sophisticated for everyday and too expensive.

EQMM is definitely a worthwhile magazine for any true fan of mysteries.  Is every story exceptional, of course not and that's unrealistic to expect it to be.  The stories are however entertaining and you get the opportunity to see something from some of your favorite writers.  I think it's enjoyable to read a short story from writers you like whether it is a surefire classic or just another tale.  To address, some of the issues by the jaded first reviewer, look at it from the standpoint of a mystery lover.  If the publishers only produced great classic books, we would have only a handful of books each year, instead of the masses that readers have the fun of combing thru each year. The pages smudge, but this is not a magazine that is mass produced like People or Time or Sports Illustrated.  At the current price, you could probably only get one to two stories a month for glossy pages.  If you're reluctant to get a subscription then at least go to your local bookstore and buy the latest copy of EQMM and find out for yourself how enjoyable getting a quick glimpse into dozen of mystery writers can be

OK, so there aren't as many ads (which incidentally helps its portability), but I've been reading Computer Shopper for 6 years now, and I still find it a great read and a very valuable resource. I read every issue not only for its usefulness, but also for entertainment value - I guess you can call me a tech geek! It's a great tool for keeping up to date with the latest high tech gear - I particularly like the Alfred Poor's Computer Cures articles and how-to guides for us "do-it-yourselfers".  Its features and buying guides are relevant and very informative. Over the past few years, I have bought several computer systems for myself and family members, thanks to advice from the experts at Computer Shopper and their recommendations on where to buy. So, even though I do miss the "tech-mall" feel of the old magazine, I'm still a fan and would recommend it to anyone interested in buying technology

The New Yorker has made it's way to our kitchen table since I was tall enough to see over the edge of the table.  My Mom was an avid reader and now I buy the magazine, cause she would have wanted it that way.

I like it for the cartoons and I'm absolutely naive when it comes to politics, so I need this magazine to get some idea of what is going on. 

With all the Blogging and other nonsense, I feel secure that the New Yorker does diligent fact checking before it prints something, so I rely on it where I won't rely on news printed on the internet.

Few magazines can match the New Yorker's high caliber of journalism, fiction, reviews, and of course, cartoons; all written by some of the best writers in the land.  It makes mainstream magazines like Time and US News look like high school newspapers.  But, one word of caution: if you're the type of person that whines "liberal bias" at anything that you slightly disagree with, then this is not the magazine for you.

It now looks a lot like a hip, European magazine-kind of like "Jalouse", my favorite French publication

<review_text>
I don't know if anyone else out there has noticed this, but JANE Magazine has gone through an  A-M-A-Z-I-N-G transformation! I picked up the October issue this week, and was shocked to find out that it not only has gone through a visual transformation. (It now looks a lot like a hip, European magazine-kind of like "Jalouse", my favorite French publication), but also, the information provided inside is really valuable and applicable to my lifestyle. (I am 24) There's tips for decorating your home with cool silkscreened rock posters, delicious recipes for dinner guests on a budget, and really great fashion coverage that is not at all cookie-cutter and formulaic like some of the other women's books (aka Lucky, Glamour, etc) Also, the voice of the writers is so clever, and funny-I would hang out with these girls!! Anyway, I am not going to go on and on like a crazy person, but I was so excited that I wanted to share with u folks-Follow my lead and pick up a copy (or a subscription) asap!!

now known as Body & Soul, which I do not care for
</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
I'm one of those people who always looks up product reviews before buying ANYTHING, so it was on a leap of faith that I bought Natural Health magazine without reading anything about it.  A friend suggested it, and since this particular friend has never led me wrong before, I caved in and bought the July/August 2005 copy immediately.

Let me start off by saying that I'm an extremely picky person.  I have extremely high standards for every purchase I make, and I absolutely will not cut a manufacturer any slack if I find a fault.

Now that I've gotten that out of the way, I will mention that I was thoroughly impressed with Natural Health.  Long ago, I subscribed to New Age magazine (now known as Body & Soul, which I do not care for).  It was among my favorites solely due to its wide variety of content and true-to-focus natural lifestyle tips and advice.  I cannot stand redundancy, incorrect information and excessive advertising.  I found that Natural Health was much more long the lines of the former New Age magazine, filled with dozens of little gems that make it worth much more than the $3.95 I paid.

To give you an idea of what the magazine includes, here is a small sampling of the articles I found in the July/August issue:

Small articles include:

- "To bee or not to bee", a breakdown on aromatherapy ingredients that include bee pollen, royal jelly, propolis, and honey, stating just how effective and natural these ingredients are.
- "How can I get relief from PMS?" Experts (including a Naturopath, Gynecologist and Dietitian) answer this question with excellent responses.
- "Medicine Cabinet: attack of the weekend warrior" Natural remedies and aids for those like myself who love to be weekend warriors.
- "Clothes to pose in" Great yoga gear!
- "Medical Breakthroughs"
- "Healing Supplements:  8 ways to beat anxiety"
- "Fitness Fix - knee savers"

Longer articles include:

- "Healthy Appetites: savvy strategies for eating well" Delicious, healthy recipes and tips.
- "Good medicine: a clean, healthy mouth" A well-researched article on "mercury fillings, fluoride toothpaste and the best at-home remedies".
- "Five Paths to Peace" Five simple meditation techniques.
- "Eat to Beat The Heat: Yin Foods" More great recipes!
- "Sacred Spaces" - making your home your personal retreat.

This is only a sampling; in fact, that's less than half of the magazine alone.  Some articles are fairly short, but provide just the right amount of information to get the point across.  My personal favorite was the last page, "Make One Change", where this month's change is to "upgrade your z's".  It included simple tips that I was able to implement immediately.

The amount of advertising seemed slightly less than usual (probably about the same amount as you'd find in a Yoga Journal, but not nearly as many as in Oprah magazine), and they seemed to be in line with the natural health focus.

Judging by the past reviews on Natural Health, it seems the magazine had a bad run in the 2003-2004 timeframe.  Let's remember that magazines change editors frequently.  I found none of the past complaints to be true in this issue, but that may not be so in future issues years from now.  As for me, I want a subscription ASAP

As someone who has recently become more interested in a healthier, organic way of life, I decided to check out several magazines on the subject matter.  Many did not strike my fancy.  For example, I found Organic Style Magazine to be a little too fashion and product-oriented for my taste, while Mind, Body, and Spirit Fitness seems a little too redundant and doesn't cover natural and organic living at all.  Natural Health, however, falls somewhere in between, covering a nice array of topics including fitness/diet, natural remedies, beauty, and food/recipes.  As someone who is not interested explicitly in holistic medicine and naturopathy, I appreciate the diversity this magazine has to offer.   

Though many of the articles do cover ideas and products that aren't entirely natural or organic, I still find them to be useful.  Many items and articles, though not all, are vegetarian-friendly as well as eco-conscious, which I appreciate.  One of my few complaints is that the articles can be short, sometimes merely "glossing over" many topics.  However, if one piques my interest, it can be a decent jumping off point to do further research.

Though I can't compare with the previous version of the magazine that everyone else seems to have preferred, as I only began to pick this up at my local whole foods market in the last year, I can say that I am impressed with what Natural Health has to offer it's readers.  Sure, there are several ads plaguing the pages, but I still feel as though there are far fewer advertisements than many of the magazines on the shelves today.  Besides, some of the ads have led me to decent products I would not have known of otherwise.  

Furthermore, at this price, how can anyone really go wrong

I guess I don't have the agendas of other reviewers.  I prefer to use organic foods, healthcare, and body products, and find this magazine offers much useful information on alternatives to conventional offerings.  I am not familiar with the "old" Natural Health magazine, maybe it was more "earthy-crunchy" or something, but I found nothing offensive in the "new" format.  I would recommend this magazine to my mother and my siblings and friends, who I'd like to see dip their toes into the world of natural health/beauty/food products.  Just be aware that not everything in here is purely organic.  I find this magazine much less offensive than "Organic Style", which in its last issue had models wearing leather coats, uber expensive consumer goods, and advertising from merchandisers who are definitely NOT on the organic band wagon

Filter and Under the Radar are the only music magazines I come near. I hear Mojo is just as informative, renovative, and enjoyable, but I'm a little too close-minded to care about other genres I... don't care much about. Fans of rock/pop/what the kids are calling "indie"/alternative/punk/post-punk/folk/!!!!, take a gander at this. 

And the covers are slick and durable. They don't look out of place sitting on a coffee table.

I have been a Smart Money subscriber for over three years. I must say that each month I look forward to receiving the new issue. It needs to be said (to those who aren't aware) that this is a publication of the Wall Street Journal. There isn't as much market news but the writing is just as good. From undervalued stock picks, to mutual fund screening and research, finding cheap bottles of good wine, car ratings, retirement planning and portfolio health - this magazine hits on many important topics for people in their working years. I find the writing to be accurate and insightful. I would still be a subscriber if the subscription was $3 per issue. That's the true value I find in it. Hands down it's the best personal finance magazine around. Head and shoulders above Money & Kiplingers

This is a magazine I frequently get confused with Foreign Affairs magazine. The primary difference is the longer well-written essays by leading experts in Affairs whereas Foreign Policy has a more frequently published, more up to date and more direct version of the other. It would be great to have both since Policy keeps you more current with a high degree of professionalism while the other gives you the deeper detail. If you don't have a lot of time to read, Policy is the one you'll need and enjoy.

Foreign Policy is a terrific journal.  It goes beyond the conventional wisdom in an effective manner:  Topics are well-chosen;  orientation is not as predictable as New Republic or tendentious as an academic journal.  Good links and bibliography.  Stimulating arguments and perspectives.  I enjoy it; recommend it; and often give subscriptions to friends

The Good
--------
* This is a nice magazine for the price. 
* It has some informative articles, which maybe useful to newcomers to photography in general or the digital aspects of photography. 
* If you are getting started in photography, or you are at a beginner/amateur level, this magazine can be very helpful as a stepping stone
* If you are an experienced amateur/pro, you can still like this magazine, but don't expect many in-depth/advanced topics.
* The Monthly Lens reviews are helpful to SLR/DSLR users
* For people who like to flip through magazines and even look at ads from different vendors, this is a good resource.


The Not so good
---------------
* The technical reviews of digital cameras are skin-deep compared to the in-depth technical reviews by the online photography sites (such as dpreview). 
* Sometimes the reviews are word-smithed in such a way that they avoid saying negative things, so -at times- you have to pick-up on what is not said in the review in order to figure out if there's something wrong with a product.
* The "News" are 4-12 weeks behind real time. 
* If you expect in-depth or pro-level articles, those are rare.


Consumer beware segment
-----------------------
Towards the back of the magazine there are plenty of ads from various mail-order vendors. Some of them are very reputable, honorable and reliable vendors such as B&H and J&R. 

However, some other vendors are less than stellar - to put it in mildly. You will recognize them by the too-good-to-be-true super-low prices, and they usually practice "bait & switch" among other things. These have been documented on various websites and photography forums. If you are not familiar with all these, and you see prices that are very low, you may want to do some research before purchasing

i heard of this magazine even before i came to this country and it never disappointed me ever since i subscribed it. i valued it most among other photography magazines i subscribed to. the reason is that i find this magazine have &quot;real stuff&quot;. for equipment, it has a detailed and objective test. the articles are not just obscure evaluation u find elsewhere, for instance, it once said:&quot;...based on our field and lab test, this amateur lens gives a better performance than its professional counterpart...&quot;, whereas in other magazines, what u find probably is &quot;this lens is good, and that one is nice...&quot;. for photo tips, it is more insightful than just &quot;sunny 16&quot; or &quot;always use a tripod&quot;. u can find the photographer's own consideration as to why put the composition this way but not that. in all, i think this magazine is for anyone who is interested in photography to begin and continue wit

American Heritage is a fine magazine brought to us by the same publishers who bring us Forbes Magazine. It is a magazine that examines history in all shapes and forms, examining past events and cultural changes that have shaped the American nation. 

One thing about this magazine that you will notice right away is that it is not just a magazine about American political history or the type of history that you remember from your school days. It does talk about this type of history, but it also includes stories about music, art, and other topics, breaking them apart and explaining how and why things happened the way they did and how they compare to the present. It also points out facts from the past that are more obscure, making for some very stimulating reading. 

Current events are also covered in this magazine, and in these instances, American Heritage discusses present- day phenomena from an intellectual and critical standpoint, often comparing it to similar events in the American past. This helps to keep the magazine current and more in- tune with important issues of the day.  

History buffs will love this magazine, and so will those of an intellectual persuasion. The articles here are more thoughtful than other magazines and many of them require greater concentration. For these reasons, American Heritage is not really a casual reading type of publication. It is intended for those who like to read, think, discuss, and debate. It's one of my favorite magazines of its kind on the market today.

When I was little, my dad always said good things about this magazine.  My attitude was always &quot;I'm not gonna buy a magazine to bore myself some more&quot; - I mean, c'mon, it's a history magazine.  I was absolutely wrong.  I picked up this magazine one day and I was hooked.  I would say that American Heritage has found its way to make history interesting.  One way that it does this is to somehow weave issues of current interest (as subtle as they may be) into its articles.  On the second thought, I should have listened to my dad from the beginning - he's an anesthesiologist - he knows what put people to sleep and what does not.  This magazine keeps me awake - sometimes I would put my paper/project aside just so that I could finish my copy in one sitting.  It's unfortunate that this magazine only comes out every two months.  American Heritage makes history grrreattt! ... even for a non-history buff in his early 20's like myself

I just wrote a review for OPM, and had forgotten about this magazine.  I also used to subscribe, and had recently let my subscription run out.  I will not say it is not because I do not like this magazine, but because I am trying to save some money.  But the fact is, that this is probably the best multiplatform gaming magazine on the market.

The reviews are smart and fresh, never hackneyed, or cliched, the way a lot of other magazines are (and some of my reviews, sorry guys!).  But the introductory article in each and every magazine, by the Chief editor, always sounds like it has been written by a Harvard Grad, with a Layman's ability to make everything easy to understand.  He has a way of making every article within the magazine all come together.  Never biased, they are not afraid of telling it like it is in their reviews.

I would highly recommend subscribing to this magazine, and like somebody else mentioned, better to go directly to the store, and get the discount card.  After $150 - $200 in used game purchases, it pays for itself.   

Highly recommend!

I had forgotten, I had called Customer Service about a missed issue.  They were nice enough to extend me a two issue subscription free of charge, to cover my missed issue.  I was quite impressed, and tickled pink, when I got my newest copy in the mail, when I arrived at my posh homestead.  

Thank you Game Informer for continued excellent service and a wonderful magazine.

Since first getting this mag from Gamestop as one of those free add on things you get when you buy games there I have come to really like it. Unlike other magazines who only seem to care about backing one system or another Game Informer talks about everything that is going on in the gaming world, even addressing the serious issues of children and M rated games

In the world of gaming, there are specialized magazines for each system (PlayStation Magazine, Xbox Mag, etc.), most of which suck because they only report on (duh) games on their respective systems.  Others, like Electronic Gaming Monthly, encompass most systems but only do it half-assed, not really giving you anything to make you think highly of it.  Then, there's GameInformer.  There are many things that set GameInformer apart from many other "gaming" magazines:

1)  They have completely unbiased opinions about the games they play.  If the game sucks, they say so; if it's an awesome game, they'll tell you about it.

2) Matt Helgeson (Senior Gaming Editor) and the other editors actually inform you about the game's most necessary attributes: its ESRB rating (E to M), their rating for the game (from 1 to 10), and a brief introduction to the game's faults and successes.  Best of all, however, they include screenshots from the game- and most screenshots rock.

These are just some of the reasons that GameInformer magazine is the absolute best gaming magazine on the market.  I have a subscription to this magazine and this magazine only, and I hope my review has explained why.

Overall, this is the best gaming magazine I have read.  It covers all consoles, gives sensible (and funny) reviews, and previews the hottest upcomming games.  

Most games are reviewed by two people, adding to the accuracy of the score.  It has a rating of 1-10, 10 being the best, a rating which precious few games recieve.  

The previews section gives you a sneek peek of upcomming games.  Some of them are one page long, some ten.  They all include pictures, and most have an estimated release date.

Also, there is a section on news in the game industry.  Ususlly near the beginning of the magazine, they include news on developers, consoles, and the big names in the industry.  

All in all, this is a great magazine, and well worth your money, because each issue is well over 100 pages

I've been a P&W subscriber and reader (even when not a subscriber) for years. I've also tried various other writers' magazines, such as The Writer and Writer's Digest. The latter two were fine when I was just beginning to dip into the freelance market, just beginning to look at publishers for first manuscripts, but when I gained more experience, I soon realized those just didn't make the cut anymore. The articles were too often repetitive and geared towards such elementary basics that I was no longer gaining new insights. P&W was the next step up. 

P&W provides advice, inspiration, informative interviews, current resources for the more experienced and discriminating writer. The bimonthly issues include articles, detailed listings of markets, contests, grants, and helpful, relevant ads. For the price, this is the best magazine available today for the writer who has a portfolio already underway and keeping an ear to the ground for more, staying up to date with what's rumbling in the literary world. With its up-to-date information, I've been able to leave the others aside, including that old bible, Writer's Market, which was, unfortunately, obsolete the moment it was off the presses. 

Highly recommended for the writer wanting more.

I'll let others argue whether or not the quality of the magazine has subsided over the years. I, for one, still get something out of  the writing. Can't do without my monthly dose of Harper's and The Atlantic.

What I would like to point out is that why would you buy here when the subscriptions cost less on A.M.'s own website

I used to read the online content for this magazine (I still check out the blog), but I have to say that there is even more content in the magazine than there is online, and it's really worth subscribing.  The articles are well written and usually change my mind on issues I may not have realized I had a mind to change on.  I would recommend this magazine to anyone

There are not many magazines specializing in political commentary that are really any good these days. So many of them are geared toward a political party, instead of concentrating on the issues that are most important. "Reason" magazine is the exception, and with its motto that a "free mind implies a free market" and vice versa, it has proven to be a publication that one can count on for objective analysis under the umbrella of that motto. The authors who write for it definitely have their biases, but they are attentive to these biases, and usually anticipate and answer objections to the ideas on which they expound. 

Many times this reviewer heard that the authors and editors of Reason are "socially liberal" but "fiscally conservative." This kind of description almost implies that their thinking is a mere hybrid of liberalism and conservatism. But this description is incorrect, for the content of the articles in Reason is a consequence of the general belief among its authors and editors that freedom, and that means first freedom of the mind, is a moral universal, regardless of the place and context in which one finds oneself. The `social liberalism' of Reason, if one is to call it that, manifests itself in the tolerance of ideas that one finds repugnant. The `fiscal conservatism' of Reason manifests itself in the belief that freedom is to be not subject to an arbitrary and coercive government that has no qualms about using deception or actual force to collect taxes, impose censorship, or generally violate individual rights. 

There are always many fine articles written in Reason on a diversity of topics. The advocacy of biotechnology is refreshing and reflects a common sense attitude that is very rare in political debate on this branch of technology. One will also find commentary on government waste, propaganda, torture, and the "war" on drugs. In addition, many book reviews are included on books that are relevant to the issues that the magazine wants to address. One can only hope that Reason stays afloat and delivers many more insights in the years to come. The magazine is both a barometer of freedom of thought as well as its creation.

I subscribed to Details because I'm interested in the male psyche. I also like looking at the male celebrity pictures and the guy models on ads. Its not the most politically correct article on the planet, for one the last page is called "gay or...?" In which the writer tries to uncover if a certain type of person is gay or not, and no conclusion is actually ever given so I suppose its for the reader to decide. 

Its a very stereotypical part of the magazine, but beyond that there are cool articles to read from male perspectives. I also enjoy reading the celebrity interviews, in addition they include interviews with female celebrities. I don't agree with everything that is printed here, but certain articles have made me think and I've actually gotten a lot out of it. It helps me understand guys and I do agree with certain opinions. The mag leans toward the liberal and is unabashed in its attitude to do so. I like it a lot, it may  not be for everyone and that's fine.

Jeff Goldblum's character in "The Big Chill" said that he couldn't write an article longer than the average person could read during a, er, "trip to the library" (wink, wink, nudge, nudge, know what I mean?). The writers at Details seems to have the same marching orders. In these hectic times, maybe that's not so bad. The articles I have read are well researched and nicely bite-sized.  I actually finished the entire magazine between PM mail delivery and breakfast the next day. The topics they covered in my first issue ranged from fashion to health concerns. And, again, they cover the topics in very few, well-written pages. I do think the models look like under-fed children but at my age, that could be tunnel-vision (grey hair, I remember Filmore East, you get the picture?). My suggestion, take a look. It's a magazine with an interesting voice and it may be for you.

I love this magazine, the images are crisp, the writing consistantly to quality and the photography is always fabulous.  Let's face it when a magazine coins a phrase, you know it's good.  I have read GQ for several years and have found it consistantly good, though I must confess the only part that I consider must read every month is Style Guy, I don't always agree with him, but I love the questions, you really wonder if these people have ever picked up the magazine the are writing to..one never knows.  The clothes they feature are usually top shelf, uh with top shelf prices as well..I mean a $2000 pair of alligator lofers..you gotta love it.  If you have any interest in the latest styles and some great writing as well, then I highly recommend this book to you, though frankly I can't imagine anyone reading this that does not already have an opinion of this iconic magazine..but if you don't then by all means pick it up and form your own opinion..it's worth the effort

Since the early 80's I have been a fan of Cemetery Dance magazine. It comes every other month full of short stories by popular and up and coming horror authors. The magazine also contains great movie and book reviews, advertising, and author interviews. I encourage any horror fan to check out their website...the staff there is very friendly and helpful. On those hot summer days, it is a super mag to delve into and forget about the weather!!!! Enjo

I've been a subscriber for over fifteen years, and will probably continue to subscribe until the day I die. But at times I find National Geographic frustrating. I have no interest in Soccer, nor do I want a huge fold-out map discussing the sport. Aren't there more phenomenal things going on in the world today? Also, Geographic does have its pet topics. 

How many articles must we read about Pandas? A dozen? I like pandas, believe me, but surely there are other less cute animals to discuss. Also I could do without lectures and PC environmental propaganda. The articles about oil-drilling in Alaska was filled with a thinly veiled agenda which was preachy and annoying. Yeah, we get it, you don't want Alaska drilled. Can we move on, please?

Other articles are quite interesting. I enjoy the zip code discussion, the old-fashioned pictures, and articles about countries. I could do with fewer articles about underwater archaeology though, and the articles filled with preachy environmentalist scolding gets boring.

A friend of mine (a Joe Average type guy), said he stopped subscribing to Geographic because the articles were depressing him. I tried to argue with him, because I think the magazine is great- but I do kind of have to agree, the topics of late are downbeat and aren't particularly uplifting. I do believe the magazine is getting a little 'out there' with its choice of topics, too. 

I recommend this magazine for those interested in the environment and the world around them

Although the stories and interviews in The Strand are well worth reading, I think it is worth saying that there are not many stories per issue, and, at least in the case of John Mortimer's Rumpole stories, they are taken from forthcoming books. That being said, The Strand is worth the four stars I've given it, but I would describe it as a &quot;coffee-table&quot; magazine, if such a category exists, due to its glossy pages, large size format, and relatively low number of stories and interviews in content

Mother Jones is what Journalism should be: gutsy, honest, no-holds barred investigative reporting.  Regardless of your political party, this is one of the last vestages of honest reporting left available to us.  
Everything from world news, the envirnment, American politics and current events is researched thoroughly and reported honestly.

A must read for people interested in more news than is available the newspaper, or in Newsweek and Time.  If your tired of the pathetic blather that parades as news these days, it's time for Mother Jones.

If you're like me - middle-aged, white, male, conservative, Christian, who buys most of my clothes at Old Navy - you will be the target of all the condescending ridicule in every article.  And yet I find it very entertaining!  Although I'll never be able to afford even one of their recommended outfits, and I'm usually a full 180 degrees opposite of their political views, I find their articles interesting, well-written, and insightful.  I must admit, I should hate Esquire, because the editors and writers would find me disgusting.  But somehow I look forward to seeing it in my mailbox every month.  The writers, if nothing else, are intelligent, which is more than I can say for the writers in most guy magazines like FHM and Maxim

I will always subscribe to this fabulous magazine.   There is so much variety in each issue.  I am amazed at how this magazine always get me interested in things that I have never even thought about before.  And the way the articles are written, I feel like I am being entertained while I am being informed -- it's awesome!  The mix is not just heavy subjects either -- there are always ighter-weight articles too, so I can pick up this magazine on any occasion when I'm in any mood and I can always find something that I want to read about

This is an excellent magazine. There are very few magazines that I choose to read cover to cover. This is one of the few.

The photographs illustrate the text and accompany it just right. They are gorgeous. 

The writing is clear and concise and interesting. The topics they write on include history, travel, historical objects, animals, places and so on. 

One monthly article that has fast become my favorite is about photographers. Each month they highlight a famous picture and the photographer who took it and discuss what made that picture 
important. They tell a little bit about the photographer and the person who was photographed (if it is a person). 

This is a fascinating magazine and well worth the money. Enjoy.

Smithsonian says it like it was, albeit short and sweet.  Without sprinkling complex grammar and cute expressions that are the hallmark of so many publications, Smithsonian provides the latest meaningful scholarship, especially if it departs from traditional concepts.  Their photos are always profoundly informative and fresh, without cut and paste from the time-honored sources.  Their article on Gavrilo Princip, the assassin of Archduke Francis Ferdinand, shook me to the core.  Thanks Smithsonian.

"Fortune" is a classic on the newsstand, and is as vital and important today as ever. "Fortune" generally caters to people with a managerial bent, especially upper-level executives, but also offers excellent analysis on current events in the business world, the global and national economic climate, and forward-looking technology and trend information. 

Each issue is normally organized around a theme or major story, like the Enron trial, or the 100 best companies to work for in a given year. I do enjoy the articles where they rank things, but more than the rankings themselves, I am always interested in the justifications they use for their rankings; while I don't always agree with the magazine, I do always find it good food for thought.

The features are generally very polished and accurate, and the lessons are conveyed in a straightforward manner that is as useful to a CEO as to a college business student. I particularly appreciate the interviews that "Fortune" has with key players in the financial industry, and also appreciate the very useful index of companies and individuals featured in every issue. 

The magazine will probably not be the favorite for investing advice because it also covers so much other financial terrain; small investors may also want to read a more specific magazine like "Kiplinger's." Nonetheless, the investment advice and insight "Fortune" offers should generally be held in high esteem. 

I also appreciate the coverage of key trends, and in particular want to note that "Fortune" has been in the lead with excellent reporting on the pension crisis in America: coverage of this sort is what makes me a loyal reader.

Many other financial magazines are available and are competing for your money; while there are several I would recommend, "Fortune" remains a reliable source of information on macro-level trends, and should be a part of everyone's business library

Of the Big 3 (FORTUNE, Forbes, and BusinessWeek), I like FORTUNE the most.  BusinessWeek feels like it's always copying someone or dying to jump on the bandwagon for the next big thing.  Forbes is a good magazine but sometimes is so original that it veers too far from its original purpose---to report and analyze the business world.
FORTUNE profiles the people it chooses and writes about current events without just summarizing the way BusinessWeek does

Our growing row of Everyday Food issues has the potential to become an extremely resourceful cooking library, but where is the card catelogue? If I want to find a particular recipe or a new recipe that I can make with a particular ingredient, I'd have to flip through hundreds of pages.

Luckily, I located a downloadable Everyday Food Index at OmniNerd.com. When used together, the magazine and Index truly make something that can be used effectively everyday

As a subscriber to Martha Stewarts magazines I have to admit this has become my favorite, simply because its concise and interesting to boot.  Love the Week End dinner section, as well as the Recipe Index at the front of the magazine which is helpful when I am looking for something quick to consider fixing, but do not have the time or desire to sit down and read the whole magazine. 

Some of the other regular features that I like and find helpful are the Cooking for One section, since as a widow I hate wasting food and know of many other singles who want to eat healthy but need some ideas.  Also like the Wine Basics section which has enlightened me on new wines that I now like trying.  In Season is a great section because it reminds the reader what is in season, which makes shopping and cooking easier. 

The size of the magazine is nice because it slips easily into my pocket so I can recheck it while shopping to see what items I have highlighted to pick up.  This is also a great magazine for couples, singles of all ages, which is refreshing since so many magazines are geared to upper middle class, 2.5 children homes.  And... the magazine seems to improve with each new issue

I have been getting this magazine for a year now. I have a few new favorites I make on a regular basis. The pictures are pretty. The prep times have been accurate for my cooking speed. The ingredients are all easy to find in my local grocery store. There is detailed nutrition info available for the dieters. So if you are looking for some nice new things to make this is a great way to find them.

I never subscribe to anything! This magazine is great. There are usually quite a few recipes with ingredients that are easy to find and a nice mix of healthy recipes and indulgent recipes.  I'm on a health kick right now and find  most cooking magazines aren't that useful to me. I might enjoy reading them but I don't actually use their recipes. I've made 4 of the recipes out of this last Everyday Food issue and they were very healthy (lots of veggies, chicken, brown rice, salmon etc.) tasted really good, and were also fast which is a bonus for me. I'd give this magazine 10 stars if I could :-

I have looked at many photography magazines - many of them are just filled with ads....not what an amateur is looking for. I wanted indepth articles, helpful tips and information to help me improve my craft. I found it here. I read every issue cover to cover and back again. I find helpful information in every issue. I highly recommend this magazine - even if you aren't purely an &quot;outdoor&quot; photographer

I'm a bit of a magazine junkie and subscribe to about 15 different magazines (and slowly reviewing them all).  In Style is DEFINITELY my favorite FASHION magazine.  It doesn't give advice on how to pleasure your man but they do have a few fun articles on celebrities and fashion-related news.

The styles they show are so versatile and easy to assemble yourself in real life.  In Style offers alternatives to super expensive clothing by categoring some pieces in $, $$, and $$$.  I love it because I can afford 80% of the fashion they show, whereas Elle, Vogue, and W are all a little bit "over" my taste.  To me, In Style is more affordable and easier to relate to on an everyday basis.  If you do enjoy high fashion and $1000 purses, you should probably look elsewhere.

In Style offers a healthy dose of celebrity fashion that I need every month, and I really, do do do love this magazine

I've been reading Foreign Affairs since 1980 and have always admired the well rounded scope covering everything from Social & Cultural issues, Media/Public Opinion, International law, Human rights, Economics, Trade & Finance, Science & Technology, Intelligence, Energy, resources & environment, International organizations, and the list goes on. 

What I love most about this journal is that there is no agenda - the journalism is highly ethical and thorough. You'll also find out about great new books. I've loved and studied International Relations since 1980, and this is the one magazine that has never let me down. Its coverage is the pinnacle in print journalism. 

Deserves 10 stars!

one of the most erudite music magazines on the market!  several in depth articles in each issue.  extensive reviews that don't fudge - candid and critical, and lots of pings to bands you've heard before, when reviewing those it's likely you haven't.  the only criticism i can think of, is that it's become so big and thick with ads that it's gotten harder to get thru!  but many of the ads display great graphic design, even they are fun

This is one of my favorite magazines, and the only magazine subscription I've ever given as a gift.  My list of recipients should tell you a lot about for whom this magazine is appropriate.  I've gifted The Floss to my 73-year-old retired grandma, my 23-year-old writer sister, my 40-year-old trivia buff co-worker, and my 15-year-old high school sophomore cousin.  You might call me lazy for using one gift to knock off a good portion of my Christmas list, and you're probably right.  But there's something in Mental Floss for everybody.  

I pick up a half-dozen conversational nuggets each month.  I probably subscribe to 10 mags, and I'd say this is the one I actually read every month.  Great stuff.  My highest recommendation.

Despite its name, this mag isn't just for brainy types.  Anybody who's interested in knowing more quirky, fascinating things about the world around them -- presented in a highly readable, humorous style -- will find 'mental_floss' a fun read.  Interested in the weird history of hackers?  Ever wanted to know how to grow your own organs or wrestle an alligator?  All written by your smart, funny friend from college -- or so the mag's super-accessible style will have you thinking.  A definite recommend

I've actually met people who have said, "I'm too old to learn new things." And younger folk who have said, "That's too much like being in class." If you're one of these people, don't bother with Mental Floss magazine, or with going to school any more, or for that matter, with continuing to be alive in the first place. Living is learning, and this magazine helps edify and entertain you while you're doing all that living and learning. Most highly recommended.

But if you like staying stupid, you're probably not reading this. Carry on, then.

P.S. To the person who complained that the editors correct their previous mistakes and clarify their obfuscations in each issue: you'd prefer the wide variety of publications and TV "news" shows which don't ever acknowledge human error? Good luck with that

Not as deep as MacWorld but worth the subscription due to the alternative perspective on software and hardware. Very fun to read with a unique style of writing. The reviews can rarely be spotty with lack of depth as the culprit in some cases. The majority, though, are on target. The best part of the magazine are the unique 3rd party hardware finds. Overall a great addition and enjoyable read

needed. It's just as informative as MacWorld but more fun too read. To me MacWorld is like reading a text book while Mac Addict is like learning the same information from a really funny professor.

I especially like the Do-It-Yourself projects that MacAddict walks you through each month. They range in difficulty from how to build your own Mac OS X icons, to how to program your own video game in Visual Basic, to how to void your warrantee by soldering crazy stuff to the motherboard. These guys are seasoned mac geeks and they aren't afraid to help you become one too.

If you're a super sensitive person, MacAddict may rub you the wrong way. Sometimes their editors make jokes that draw hate mail from the readers, like when the Polish editor in chief cracks Polish jokes. I don't mind these silly things, but some might. To me all of the jokes usually help their articles make a more concrete and lucid point.

Throughout the year MacAddict has special issues devoted to topics like maintenance, practical jokes, digital media, preventing disasters, detailed OS X guides, etc. I find these invaluable.

I'm the guy my friends ask for mac help, not because I'm smarter than other people, but because I've been reading this great magazine for 6 year

Let's face it ....... owning a Mac is like owning a Harley or an Airstream.

It's a cult!!!

Good fun.  Harmless as can be and it just makes you feel good everytime you sit down at your Mac.  Having a magazine come every month with a bunch of foolishness about this very slick machine increases the joy way more than the magazine price.

I read it from cover to cover and even believe some of it

This magazine is totally awesome. from the excellent software on the disk, to the FREAKIN-AWESOME reviews, to the silly humor and funny letters on the back pages, this magazine is for any mac user who want's more than the professional MacWorld can give

Projecting humor into a computer magazine is not something many editors can do, bu Rik Myslewski (spelling?) does a great job. I totally recommend it

most of the beautiful gardens I see are in Washington or Oregon or back east somewhere.  Having lived in Washington, I do enjoy seeing some of the plants that I am missing here in Colorado, but it would be nice to see a more varied selction of gardens becasue we all can't live in the Pacific Northwest.  I have a subscription to Sunset so I guess that will have to suffice, but I do wish BH&G would take that into consideration.

Otherwise, I LOVE this magazine.  I used to get several magazines, but this was always my favorite.  It is chock full of ideas that we can really use.  And I love the photography.  What sets BH&G apart is that you can see a hint of life in these beautiful houses.  Slippers on the floor, newspaper on the table and often the owners of the home are in the pictures too.  They are sometimes blurred from movement which is actually nicer than a posed shot.  It helps set the feeling that this home is lived in and is attainable.  

I would say get this magazine right away.  I would have given it 5 stars except for the whole garden thing.

Actually, it deserves 4.5 stars. This is a Brit magazine that offers great articles that cover classic bands' tales as much as keeping you tuned in to the latest waves of musicians, from Americana to Blues to Brit Pop.  There's at least one excellent, long article per issue which will tell you more about bands you thought you knew about than any magazine published in USA (check old issues for Dylan's or Pink Floyd's, for instance). 
If you are old enough to remember Rolling Stone when it concerned itself with musicians and other artists creating new boundaries for popular art, rather than catering the current, pathetic BritneySpear-NightmareMachine ... you would enjoy Mojo. Tip: you can get any single issue at B&N, Borders or Tower Records for the same amount, that way if you don't like it you won't have to mourn 100 bucks

W..
W is an excellent magazine (excellent + very big)
Although i must say to ensure you dont want waste your money..
W isnt for everyone!
This is such a good magazine though, i've being reading it for such a long time. And in my opinion every issue is worth it.
Just to give you an idea of what W is all about..its about:
*Amazing High Fashion spreads and fashion updates, etc etc
*A Backstage pass into the lives of Americas High Society
*Informative articles, offering opinions by the writer and the 
 readers of the magazine
*Amazing and very unique interviews of celebs and other upcoming
 people whos names will be very well-known in a very short time.
Overall, if you like reading about High-Fashion, and the lives of the Rich and Famous and indulging in abit of luxury, then W is definetly the magazine for you.

If you want a magazine based on fashion but merged with stories and interviews of top celebrities, then W magazine is perfect for you.

This large magazine is not only interesting, but beautiful. It has pages and pages of high quality, remarkable photos. Not to mention tons of beautiful fashion ads. If you live for fashion, or if you simply admire it; you will get latched onto W.

Celebrities such as Kate Moss, Mary Kate Olsen & Lindsay Lohan have graced the cover of this magazine. Pick it up even if you're the SLIGHEST bit interested. You won't be disappointed

My initial reaction to this magazine was that this magazine is huge, and full of ads.  I also read Vogue, though, and to be honest, W has less ads in it.  W convieniently avoids the snotty air of Harper's Bazaar and Vogue while at the same time avoiding the trashy how to sex up your man type articles in Cosmopolitan, Redbook, and Marie Claire, and it also avoids the rampant celebrity worship of InStyle.  This magazine has excellent layouts, and from what I've read thus far, excellent-and very different-stories.  As a regular Vogue reader, I'm used to reading about older designers like Coco Chanel, the Versace and Prada lines, and reading about a small smattering of socialites, like Aerin Lauder, Paris Hilton, Jemma Kidd, Victoria Traina.  What is different about W is that it profiles the new and the modern.  An article in the September issue profiled Kate Spade and her new line.  Other articles talked, almost sarcastically about the latest exploits of the socialites, meanwhile talking about, in an article aptly titled "A Bag Called It" the trend of statement purses and their proper place.  W is also similar to Vogue that in addition to the good layouts, it has even better photography, there are no Photoshopped to death photos in here, and if they are, this student can't find them.  What I like most about W is its sarcastic wit, something that is lost in most magazines, many of which these days assume that everyone wants to learn the latest way to sex up their man, worship Teri Hatcher, or read dumbed down articles.

First, I received this subscription as a gift for the holidays and can say that it is the gift that just gives, and gives, and gives.  This magazine has been a wonderful source of ideas for in the kitchen, on the grill, around the house, in my garden, in the state as well as all through the south for traveling.  Being a woman who moved from the Detroit suburbs to Florida so I could be with ailing family, I was really a duck out of my elements.  

I had no idea of what was where within the state; what are good places to visit, where are some of the great attractions outside of Orlando, the Keys, and the Everglades and who does what where.    In this magazine, there are sections devoted just to Florida (which I suspect they do for each state per subscription) -- what to plant when, what festivals are going on, what's hot and what's not - a whole derth of information devoted just to the state I live in.

And that's not all...

Not only do I get to learn more about where I am today, I can explore and learn about where I'd like to go tomorrow.  One month, it's "Welcome to Alabama" and all the wonderful gems it has to offer.  Another month, I am poring over beautiful Georgia.  A different topic?  Seafood of the South.  How would you like to learn about fantasic, but yet unknown, places for bargains and great finds?  

Now - I am also an avid cook at home - and I cannot tell you how much I love to read through and try/improvise on all the de-lish recipes found each month closer to the back of the magazine.  How many differnt ways have I learned to make potato salad alone is worth the cost of admission!  I have learned so much more about grilling, vegetable side dishes, breakfast treats and savories from all over the south, tempting, lip-smacking desserts - and everything in between.  I have always known the south was the jewel of the States when it came to cooking - but W.O.W!  So much history and fun can be shared whether it be in the kitchen or on the grill.  And it is a great compliment to what I learn from other books, the Food channel, and beyond.  It speaks to where I live, what I can get down here, and what the heck plantains are anyway :-)

I love looking through many of the decorating ideas, the travel tips, and vignettes of different states, or towns, or themes.  The only reason this magazine does not get a 5 from me is that it sometimes caters/addresses a crowd which can afford more than I can in the way of travel, decorating, etc.  I am more simple, down-to-earth folk, and do not share much with "decorating your summer cottage", or what to do with that spare $ thousand plus dollars on a cruise, or splurge excursion.  Sometimes, and since they are not making this magazine specifically for me I am not going to be able to relate to EVERYTHING, I am not the crowd they are talking to.  

Otherwise, this magazine is a 10 in my book  :-)  Well worth the money - but even more so - the anticipation of next month's "explorations"

Great magazine.  This is not my typical type of read, because I've never considered myself as someone into computers or multi-media.  But the great thing about this magazine is that you don't have to be someone that already knows a lot about technology to learn about the latest gizmos.  It tells you about them in simple terms too, no high-tech vocabulary needed.  I feel informed whenever I read my monthly subscription, of the better products to purchase, as well as the politics behind the big computer and internet companies

Where else can you get a magazine that talks about whatever it wants? From the perspectives of guys obsessed with computers, technology, and electronics, you get to find out news on just about anything remotely relating to these topics. Political, scientific, hollywood, businesses, technology, I love it. I get to read about topics that are covered in mainstream news sources, and on the next page, what's new with Japanese schoolgirls. I get such a kick out of it.

I also love the pseudo-geek talk that they caricature. It's kind of stupid that reviews are all "wired" or "tired" but in a funny stupid way. 

And buried in the enjoyable trash of this magazine are of course, all the many articles about new electronics that I love to keep up with. Like popular science, only not lame. Well, I do like popsci, so I shouldn't make fun of them.

No doubt, Wired is one of the best tech magazines in print, but the subscription for Wired for Amazon is apparently managed by a company called Synapse. I subscribed for a year's subscription in July and my first issue did NOT turn up even by mid November. I had to call and cancel my subscription. I now subscribe directly

As an author I find Oprah's magazine to be the most inspirational any human being could use to start their month.  "Divorcing a wife because you can not be all she needs is a very loving act.  Everyone deserves intimacy-emotional and physical.  If a gay or bisexual man loves his wife, her happiness will be more important to him than his own.  Setting her free to allow her the opportunity to be loved as she deserves to be, is the ultimate expression of love." Dennis J. Schleicher

Oprah is an inspiring role model for millions of people. I believe that her mission is well-known- to help people live their best possible lives. It's rare to find another person who so consistently sticks to their "mission" and really change lives talk show after talk show, and magazine issue after magazine issue. If you want to make your life better, live more passionately and meaningfully then The Oprah Magazine will definitely help you out. It contains many interesting, inspiriting and balanced topics on a broad range of subjects written by excellent writers and contributors. 

I am glad that the magazine still contains many really readable and informative articles appropriate for every woman who wants to feel happy, empowered, informed and intelligent. I enjoy this magazine because it opens my mind to the world and celebrates life and womanhood. Each issue has a theme such as love, health, home, fitness, etc. and will cause you to take a serious look at your life and see how you can further improve yourself. You will find interesting and up-to-date information about fashion, movie stars, book recommendations, delicious recipes, money, relationships and friends. My favorite section is her quotes on bookmarks.

Oprah Winfrey is an example of a modern, smart and sensitive woman who consistently uses her talents and staff of editors to bring us the talk show and this wonderful magazine. I think that your greatest benefit will be to gradually realize and energize her main message-You should be the first priority in your life, because if you are confused, exhausted, dissatisfied, depressed then you will not be able to help anyone! The magazine covers all of these important areas and I am pleased to recommend it. Following Oprah's tradition to draw attention to books of great value I recently read and highly recommend to my male and female clients scientist Ritz' bestseller "Scientifcally guaranteed male multiple orgasms and ultimate sex" because it truly delivers great value and results. I dare say that this magazine and book will dramatically change your life for better

The London Review of Books is, without a doubt the best literary journal in the world: at the same time erudite, entertaining and informative, each issue is a foray into a world of knowledge that is all too lacking in other publications and media. There was a time in my life when I couldn't afford to put my heating on in the bitterly cold British winter, but I never thought to cancel my subscription to the LROB. Highly recommended

The London Review of Books is simply the best generalist journal on topics of literature, the arts, culture, history, politics, philosophy published in the world today--it now beats the NY Review of Books in terms of giving you the full picture and leaves the TLS back in the dust.  If you want to get your bearings in the world of  culture and politics, this is must reading.

There is no comparing the incredibly honest reviews on Amazon with the high-brow reviews found in the LRB. One surveys average readers, and the other is the opinion of people who make a living writing about books. I, Brockeim, am more like the people than the professionals, and believes most of you are as well

Spike Fett is mistaken. The 100 Greatest Moments he mentions is not for ALL TIME. They were the top 100 moments of the magazines lifetime, which is only 8 years.

This is one of the best film/dvd magazines out there. I highly reccomend it. It has awesome articles, reliable reviews, and great color photos. 

Another thing I like about it is that its an British publication, so you get a different opinion and point of view.

Its a great magazine.

I have been a subscriber for years and have grudgingly paid more and more every year for my subscription.  Still I have always loved PW and look forward to my weekly edition...although I do not always receive my magazine in a timely manner. Whether because I live on the West Coast or if it's just the mail, I don't know.  Sometimes it arrives way into the following week, sometimes closer to the beginning of the week.  I still find the magazine valuable, but have to say the following:

For a magazine directed at the publishing trade I find it ludicrous that there are so many typos in the reviews as well as the text. WHO IS DOING THE PROOF READING HERE?  There is a new format that has updated the look, but I miss the best seller lists being in the back of the magazine.  Now they're somewhat in the middle and one definitely can't just easily flip to them.  Also, the Q&A's with authors are so stupidly placed in issues which don't contain the review of the author's book who is being interviewed.  Instead, there is a reference date to the issue said book was reviewed in. It's frustrating to read the Q&A and then not be able to see the review of the author's book in the same issue.  I guess the publisher thinks people keep the magazine at least 4 weeks or issues just lie around the house or office and pile up.  I like the "Deals" columm and "Hollywood Reader" column, but my very favorite section is the Author Profile.  I am curious tho about the age of some of the writers in this publication... I'd also like to know how the magazine and the editors decide what book should get a starred review.  Sometimes I'm astounded as to what gets starred.  The website, which you get full access to when you register as a subscriber to the magazine, is easy to use.  Even before I receive my issue in the mail, I can see the latest issue on line

I have been a reader & fan of Dog World since I had my first dogs in 1981. Being an avid dog-lover since childhood, I have always enjoyed the breeder ads & discovering breeds new to me. These days one of my favorite sections is the "rare breeds". I thoroughly enjoy the bi-annual "all breed" special issue. Although each issue does profile a breed of dog, what I like better than Dog Fancy is that the profiles are more informative & in-depth. Dog World also covers rare breeds in their profiles, not just AKC breeds. I would recommend Dog World for dog professionals & avid dog-lovers involved in dog sports; and Dog Fancy for the more casual dog people

Having recieved both DogFancy and DogWorld, I prefer DogWorld. I have found that DogFancy tends to focus more on purebreds and AKC events than on the general, everyday mutts of America and what the owner of one can do with them. As an owner of a shelter mutt, I appreciate DogWorld's emphasis on the world of dogs- their nutrition, health/care, exercise, and varied news paragraphs. I especially like the column on agility training- it is as beneficial to agility persons as well as great advice for any other sport- flyball, obedience, herding/hunting trials, etc. since all sports deal with pretty much the same mental and physical aspects. I also really enjoy the different sports they highlight in each issue. The only thing about DogWorld that bothers me is its series articles. If you don't follow one series to completion you get confused and sometimes the series are more geared to the professional world (veternarians and trainers) than to the 'regular' folk. DogWorld gives a much more rounded view of the world of dogs and what can be done with them than DogFancy which tends to focus on more of the breeding side of the world and AKC

I love to cook. I am not a professional by all means but I do enjoy the concept of preparing food. Other than tv, "Bon Appetit" is one of my main sources I refer to that inspires me to create my next meal. I have been an on and off again subscriber to the magazine for several years now. I have to admit I don't necessary use the recipes in the magazine but they and the ingredients that I read definitely leads me to come up with my own ideas. Some of my favorite issues includes the topics of barbecue (I love some of the ribs recipes they have printed over the years) and Thanksgiving. What I am not so wild about is that a lot of the recipes over the years have become so high end. From my point of view, a lot of these meals are not every day meals you would make. I am blessed to live in a big city where I can find most of the ingredients but if I lived in a smaller city or town, it probably would be difficult to find.  These recipes are not geared for single people or families who have mouths to feed. All in all, I still enjoy reading "Bon Appetit" and being inspired by the magazine

I have been reading the NY Times Book Review for many many years. There rarely is a week when there is not some review of considerable interest to me. Though I oppose its political bias which is left liberal, I appreciate the solidity, and respectful way in which most reviews are written. There is a sense that for the Times books and culture in general have meaning and importance.
The 'Times ' tends to bet for its main articles on proven winners. A review in the Times can make a person's name, and many many are the writers whose books have arrived in the 'Times' offices never to be given a real look at. 
The 'Times ' articles and reviews are not the longest and the deepest but they do often provide pleasant reads, and arouse real interest in the book in question.
The NY Times Book Review is still of first importance because the NY Times is . 
I still try to skim through every week searching for the review or two that I really have to try to chew and digest.

This is not the kind of magazine you read, at least not cover to cover.  This is for serious shopping, or shopping ideas.  Feel a whole in your wardrobe? Lucky can tell you what to put in it for a variety of price ranges.  That is one of the reasons I really like this magazine it shows different price ranges of a style so you can decide how much you want to spend on the perfect look.  It also gives great website types, which is very helpful when your stuck out in the middle of the continent.  The "everyday girl" advice on mixing and maxing is often lacking, but the magazine makes up for it with pages of clothing, shoes, etc.  Devoted to shopping, pick this up

I thought, eh, Lucky magazine, i don't really need this anymore... so I broke it off. (I am a college student, so, I'm a little bit poor. Lol.)

I was wrong. I love Lucky. I know fashion and trends are kind of an "air head" market, but I'm going to subscribe again because:

A.) I am a design student, and fashion and trends are chock full of design elements

B.) I subscribe to Newsweek and I watch the news all the time. It is depressing, Lucky is not.

C.)After coming home from a long day of classes and work, it's not so bad to want to read something with lots of pretty pictures, is it? (The answer is no, that is not bad.)

Lucky rocks. Seriously. If you want something that's fun to read and fun to look at it's great. I don't recommend it for people who are in deep credit card debt becasue they just HAD to have the latest designer handbag, becuase this will get you into trouble. FOr everyone else, who just wants to look hip... or just plain sytled. Lucky is a great magazine

Even if this magazine is a mag-a-log, what would we do without it? September issue rocks with Eva Mendes on the cover and some juicy fall finds inside. The biggest news? Lucky has found a way to shop with your cell while stuck in traffic. It's about time technology got up with our lifestyle

This magazine single-handedly taught me how to dress with style- and believe me- that's no small feat. I love how Lucky shows  how to put pieces together to look fabulous without mindlessly following the crowd. If that's all I had interest in, then I could've simply bought the Lucky shopping guide book.  But their reviews of up and coming clothing and jewelry designers, hair, makeup, home decor, and the "How I'm Wired" sections keep me coming back to the magazine.  Plus the Lucky Breaks are awesome.  My only complaint is the average price of their featured raved-about items.  What Lucky is for me is a fantastic template for fashion and style that I can use to find similar items at cheaper prices in stores like H&M, Target, etc.  It's so worth the $12/year, and I look anxiously at the beginning of each month for its arrival in my mailbox

I say almost due to the fact that Aperture gives them a good run for the money. You know those photography magazines with about 10 pages of pictures and articles and the rest is advertising? This is not it! If you enjoy a magazine that delivers informative photographing techniques, get this one! If you are interested in seeing the work of other photographer's, get this magazine! If you want a hot collectible, GET THIS MAGAZINE!!! Yes there are ads in here, but not a ton of them. For you guys (and girls) out there who love to see the occasional beautiful star photographed, get this magazine. One of the aspects of this magazine that I like, is the fact that the photo layouts are sometimes full page, unlike some magazines where you have to get out a magnifying glass to view the photos. And this one IS a hot collectible, though the French version of it is an even hotter collectible. Whether it's nature,  special effects, or provocative photography, this one is a superb magazine. In short, this one is a must get for the photography fan

I love this magazine(not because of the big ole booty's), because of the way they present the ladies. I have never seen a cover of King showing some skinny, no meat eating, starving her self to death type chic! They show real women, with real shapes. It shows how women look in the real world! I love it, and yeah I must admit, I do love the big ole booty's!! Sorry Ladies, I am a man! LoL

I ordered a free trial of this mag a while back, before starting my own e-business recently. Immediately I began a subscription. The reviews from pros on REAL businesses offer a lot of insight while the profiles give it a real world feel. 

I would recommend this to anyone even considering working in the high ranks of any business. Keeps you informed and in touch.

I subscribe to Inc.. Although I am not a business owner, yet, I find the articles to be informative and the magazine a useful resource. As an accomplished song writer and aspiring song seller, the article on (...)-May 2005- made me aware of a resource that I did know was available. Check that one out.
With Joe Mansueto, CEO of Morningstar and self-confessed fan of Inc., acquiring the magazine I can only imagine the great things ahead. The full-page N.Y. Times ad reinforces Mansueto's commitment to growing the brand. Can't wait for future issues

Inc. magazine is a publication designed to guide small businesses on their path to prosperity. With Inc., you get timely advice on taxes, marketing, financing, and many other important considerations and challenges that business owners face every day.

Probably the strongest point of Inc. is the way it presents important information to readers. The authors of this magazine get directly to the point. They don't waste your time with petty discussions and attempts to soften the blow of an undesirable fact. Even when the news is bad, like with regulations, taxation, etc., Inc. lets you have it in a direct manner. This is good, because I get annoyed by magazines that try to ease the reader into hearing some unwelcome news and then try to downplay the facts. Inc. writers are direct, and I respect them for that.

If there were some criticisms to be made about this magazine, I can think of only two: The lack of articles geared toward startup businesses and the tendency of the magazine to highlight success stories that, while nice to read about, present personal success that is a little out of reach of most business owners. Inc. is designed for small businesses that are already established and need some guidance for growth. This is fine, but I would like it a little better of there were more articles on getting a new business off the ground. And, every now and them the magazine goes off on a tangent and interviews someone who is very rich. Again, this is ok, but I would prefer to read about ordinary people who are only moderately well- off because these stories and the individual level of success they portray are more realistic. 

Still, Inc. is a very good publication for small business owners. It provides some good, timely advice on how to help your young business grow and how to handle legal issues and concerns. The price to subscribe is low, too, making Inc. magazine a must for owners of small, growing companies.

I can give this great music magazine no greater praise than to say that pretty much all of my favorite new bands in the last couple of years have been discovered through Under the Radar. On top of that, they also write great articles on some of my pre-existing favorite bands. Under the Radar generally has much better writing than some of the other indie music mags out there (Devil In the Woods, Rockpile, Big Takeover, etc.) and fits my musical tastes perfectly

Under the Radar and Filter are the only music magazines I come near. I hear Mojo is just as informative, renovative, and enjoyable, but I'm a little too close-minded to care about other genres I... don't care much about. Fans of rock/pop/what the kids are calling "indie"/alternative/punk/post-punk/folk/!!!!, take a gander at this. 

And the covers are slick and durable. They don't look out of place sitting on a coffee table

So often when looking through magazines I haven't found quite what I was looking for in the Christian literature.  I like the approach Christianity Today takes.  It has articles that are broad, and not focused on a specific demonination.  I believe the magazine has a slight evangelical bent to it.   I do like the variety of articles, and coverage of current events.  I would recommend this magazine for those who want to become a little more informed of Christianity in the modern world

This is a decent magazine and it's good to support an unabashed Christian magazine.  But if Sojourners ~sometimes~ errors to the left- Christianity ~often/ persistently~ errors to the the "right."  
I subscribe to both, and if I find myself agreeing with the editors of one magazine too long, I dig back deeper into the Bible and then come out in the right place.
Contributor Yancey is an inspiration and a true Christian voice; while Colson is deluded by the high places of power and is a stain on an otherwise reasoned approach of CT

I agree that Veranda has too many advertisements, but that's the trade-off for this very affordable, high quality publication.  I'm not sure I'm the intended target for this magazine because I can't afford most of the things in the ads, but I've gotten lots of ideas about color, layout and accessorizing that I can use, and the variety of architectural and design styles has helped me define my own style.

A woman that is passionate about beautiful things writes this review.  I am an avid do-it-yourselfer and love to do things around the house.   This magazine has been one of my favorites for years.  I look forward to each new issue and the decorating ideas that it will provide.

This magazine concentrates on upscale decorating, architecture and landscapes.  Many of the articles feature European country looks.  The photographs in this magazine are absolutely beautiful.   

The July / August 2006 edition contained the following:

1.	Venetian Villa (Adrienne Vittadini in Sarasota Florida)
2.	Nantucket Renewal (Enlarging a Classic Cottage)
3.	Blooming Intensity (Saturated with Color)
4.	Coastal Hues (Seaside Radiance Captured)
5.	British Accent (This side of the Pond)
6.	The Art of Dining
7.	The View from Veranda (Summer Place)
8.	Tableaux (Staged Elegance)
9.	Personal Luxury (Cool Coral)
10.	On Exhibit (Jungles in Paris)
11.	Trade Secrets (Summertime:  Fabrics, Rugs, Lighting)
12.	Passions (Birds of Paradise: Home Aviary Design)
13.	Showcase (Summer Seating:  For Pool and Porch)
14.	 Verdant Paths (Annevoie:  Belgium's Water Garden)
15.	The Last Word (Vanity Flair:  Adrienne Vittadini Sketchbook)

There are many photographs of this magazine of both house interiors and exteriors that I find to be very inspirational from a decorating perspective.  If you are looking for either painting or decorating ideas this magazine has much to offer.  I have replicated some of the interiors in my own home.  

The exterior photographs of this magazine are always very appealing.  I have been slowing changing the landscaping on my property to reflect a more Italian way of life.  I think you will be inspired to create an alfresco dining space after you have seen some of the beautiful landscape photographs.

The merchants that advertise in this magazine are fabulous.  I have purchased many items from them and have always been happy with my purchases.

I highly recommend this magazine to anyone that loves interior design, or just likes nice things.  This magazine is top notch all the way.

This magazine is so packed full of goodies that you may need something with wheels to carry it out. The paper alone is worth the price.

There are a lot of good books on decorating. And more on picture of foreign places. This one however is of items that you will want and maybe even afford one or two, if you have not spent all your discretionary money on books and book cases. Every library should have a fire place and this magazine often shows some of the best surrounds.  The furniture and art work is well within the norm but just beyond the ordinary.

Even if you do not take advantage of the ads and articles to spruce up your abode, you can sit back and dream of being there.

I am a serious foodie that loves to cook and is always looking for new ways to shake up the meals that I prepare for my family.  The beauty of "Gourmet" is that they do not concentrate on the cuisine of one culture.  I also appreciate that they provide articles on both the best methods, and on quick methods and dishes.  I have read "Gourmet" off and on for at least 20 years.  The magazine has changed somewhat during that time.  The focus has shifted to more of a lifestyle magazine than a pure cooking magazine.

The features of the June 2006 edition are as follows:

Tiki Time:  a collection of Polynesian food and drink
We are Family:  recipes for a summer party
A Greece Less Traveled:  northwestern Greece travel and recipes

In the section, Seasonal Kitchen, there is a very well done article on salads.  The roasted vegetable panzanella is fantastic.

In the Gourmet Everyday section, I always enjoy the three regular articles:  Quick kitchen (30 minutes meals), Five Ingredients, and 10 minute mains.  These are always tasty and usually all quick.

If you are a foodie, and/or you want to be this magazine is a nice starting point.  I would suggest that you pick up a couple of issues on the newsstand to confirm that this magazine is for you before subscribing.  I highly recommend this magazine for budding home chefs.

THE NEW YORK REVIEW OF BOOKS is published 20 times a year, biweekly except in January, July, August and September. It is a respected publication which is devoted mostly to reviews of current books and an occasional movie. It also contains articles of social or political interest. The Letters section is usually brief with little waste.

Contributors to a recent edition included Mark Danner, Sister Helen Prejean and Daniel Mendelsohn. Reviews covered such diverse items as a collection of short stories by Graham Greene and two books about the actress Anna May Wong in addition to ALEXANDER, a film directed by Oliver Stone.

THE NEW YORK REVIEW OF BOOKS consistently offers provocative writing in a highly readable style. It definitely deserves its reputation for excellence

NYRB features long, in-depth articles about recent books and events.  The "reviews" frequently take the book under discussion as a starting point for a wide-ranging essay which then becomes a work in its own right.  Indeed, I've seen articles in NYRB referred to in academic papers.  Don't fear that NYRB will bore you, however.  I've often found a NYRB article to be a great introduction to an area of thought or literature previously unknown to me.

The only negative is a rather tedious Michael-Mooreish political stance.  I have no objection to seeing Bush bashed, but wish that NYRB could do so in a more creative and less repetitive manner. Maybe once in a while we could hear from someone who actually likes the man?

Nevertheless I find NYRB an indispensable periodical.  I find it a great complement to The Economist, which features a more pro-business and pro-free trade economic stance and wider, but less deep, coverage of the world

A playground for the mind. Covers a wide range of subjects. Each review is a full essay on the subject of the book. Many reviews compare and contrast several recently published books on the same subject. Learned and sophisticated yet fully accessible.

This magazine would be a delightful reading experience for a wide audience. It appeals the *most* to busy young adults, who are looking for quick, healthy, easy-to-make delicious meals, which they just *might* want to spice up with an occasional adventurous new taste in wine recommendations. There is a wonderful column on "new flavors". In the June 2004 issue it is "lemongrass". In the July issue it is "miso". There are fine recommendations for new restaurants in exotic locales, such as, Bermuda or Sao Paolo, Brazil. Also included are foods for special holidays, such as in June for "Father's day". Naturally, grilling is the "haute cuisine" on this auspicious day. The recipes for "Salmon Nicoise Sandwiches" and "Tuscan Baby Back Ribs" are mouth-watering ... 

The "fast food" section is loaded with tasty healthful salads, such as, "Spicy Chicken, Avacado, and Mango Salad" and "Turkey and Green Bean Stir-Fry with Peanuts". Some grilling suggestions include, "Tandoori Pork with Gingered Mango Salad" and "Korean-Style Chicken Wraps". Needless to say, all the food is tempting and the recipes are not too difficult to accomplish, provided one is already familiar with cooking techniques.

Overall, the emphasis on this magazine is *not* on wine but instead on food. For a change of pace, the June issue has a very fine article on "vodka". In the July 2004 issue there is a superb article by Robert Parker called, "Australian Wine Guide". The regular wine column covers "German Reisling" by Richard Nailey. Most impressively, the July issue introduces the reader to "America's Best New Chefs of 2004". Of course, each selects a recipe to share. This magazine is loaded with unique articles for the adventurous cook and aspiring gourmand. Highly recommended. Erika Borsos (erikab93

The magazine is based on the work of an actual test kitchen outside of Boston, MA.  It is thorough and focused and right on.  I have also found it to be very impressive because it is printed on recycled paper and it isn't your typical publication with glossy paper and lots of photos.  In fact, pictures that are found within its pages are drawn by staff members, thus "illustrated".  You'd be surprised at how great it is.  It leaves you with a feeling of nostalgia with every delivery.  It is also written with great clarity.

Plus, you'll find literal gifts to yourself in every issue, atypical of most others.  There are, of course, terrific recipes.  Then you'll find equipment ratings, taste tests and comparisons, suggestions for supplies, herbs and spices, specialty foods, tips and techniques, shortcuts, etc. 

One of my most favorite areas is the editorial from the publisher in the beginning of each issue.  I love his down to earth, somewhat quirky style of writing as it is always interesting and always intelligent.

If you go to their website, name of magazine, you'll find good deals on subscriptions and they will send you a free issue.

There is something for everyone here....the novice cook and the accomplished chef.  Highly recommended.

Quite frankly this is the only cooking magazine I have ever subscribed to that I actually have looked forward to using and to receiving every two months. I like it so much I am writing my first Amazon review! The format of the magazine makes it easy to follow the recipes - they are always printed on two pages across from each other - and unlike some of the other posters I prefer the black and white format so that the paper is thicker and doesn't tear easily. Having tear away ads (for their own products) on the outside of the magazine means that the usable portion doesn't take up much space on my shelf. 

The recipes are easy to follow and usually clear. When they include specialized ingredients there is usually also a substitution listed. Their product reviews are terrific - I wish I hadn't wasted so many dinners on bad whole wheat pasta. My only gripe, as someone who does not have a dishwasher, is the great number of bowls and kitchen tools the recipes require.

I have made at least half the recipes from the magazines, many several times, which is no small feat for a "flexitarian" who never has meat as a main dish.

This is not my favorite fitness magazine.  This is the size of a Reader's Digest, but is packed with ads just like a Beauty Magazine.  I find this a bit disappointing considering the breadth of information they tend to cover.  They share reasonable and attainable goals, and suggestions for us normal people.  The magazine seems to cover a wide age group, with information that is good for both young and old.  They do offer recipes, workout suggestions, and much more.  The magazine takes little time to read, and seems to only serve as a springboard for more follow up on topics you enjoy.  I think this is a better magazine to browse through at the supermarket than to purchase

As a potential interior designer, I find that this magazine is both realistic and elegant in the articles it provides for the professional and for the hobbiest.  I have a subscription and I find that studying the designers, the styles and the themes I have learned so much about the work of a designer.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys color, fabrics or just pictures of beautifully designed rooms and interiors

This mag has its ups and downs but there is no other magazine with more class and originality. It's an icon all over the world. The editor has inspired books and movies for her perfectionism and professionalism. She and Vogue have gone a long way toward making women strong and independent. Without Vogue magazine fashion would not be a multi-billion dollar industry

Vogue used to be my favorite fashion mag out there, but today the advertisements are simply ridiculous. I think the ad to editorial ratio must by 90:10. It still has wonderful fashion tips, but the ads are becoming burdonsome. In Style has replaced Vogue as my #1 fashion mag, but I'll always be a Vogue reader

If you love fashion, you need to get Vogue.  Vogue will familiarize you with designers, classic style and the fancy-schmancy side of fashion that most other magazines will not get as deep into.  However, most of what is in Vogue is way out of the average person's reach.  I, for one, could very likely not afford one thing that has ever been in a single copy of Vogue.  However, for whatever reason, the Vogue empire continues to publish this fashion tome and sell the subs for a VERY low price (usually $12 for 12 issues).  Now THAT I can afford.  It is an unbeatable deal.  Will you glean anything from it?  Yes.  You will see how the other side lives and you will see some really wonderful photography and fashion at its best.  Is it practical?  Not really but it is fun and well worth the very low price.

It always seems like a holiday when my UTNE arrives.  It has never failed to delight me in my long tenure as a subscriber and fan.  

Nowadays, with so much of our "news" actually being political spin and hype, with that forced-fed feeling, it is so refreshing to be able to read interesting, tasty, thoroughly satisfying stuff that is not the run-of-the mill, banal, overly celebrity-focused junk. [Hey, I like celebrities just as much as the next guy, but I like to take a break once-in-a-while.]  UTNE respects your intelligence. It seems to arrive just on time, every time.

The focus here is on improving one's life and, perhaps, one's corner of the world (or just a corner of a room).  Sure, there is a progressive bent to the content (it used to be dubbed "the best of the alternative media"): there's ample pro-environment, pro-organic, pro-diversity, pro-spirituality content here. [Have they made "progressive" a dirty word, too???] I find it consistently conducive to recharging my batteries.

GO FOR IT.  YOU WILL BE AMPLY REWARDED.  Like entering a fresh, new world every two months.  You will likely read it from cover-to-cover

Interesting May 05 issue.  When I saw the cover I sighed and with a somewhat sinking heart picked it up wondering who "now" had declared war on America.

Oh! why it's only the Christians now.  This was a great issue.  I had not read one in quite awhile and forgotten how funny and sad they could be.

The Harper's Index page is full of eyebrow lifting information.  Readings was great.

The articles on the market economy and the religious right was a jaw dropper.  I had to get up and look under the table to find where mine had fallen and rolled.  Most everyone knows this information in some depth and degree but . . .  these articles were different.   Like some other books and articles I have read they are couched with the attitude of,  "Wake up, please.  Throw some water on your face, look around and Wake Up, hurry before it's too late".  Once you get through the large amount of heartbreaking information contained  (Please tell me that America did not `sell' cornmeal that we knew was going to starving people etc., etc., etc.) you are deposited at Karbola for an account of the Sunni versus Shia and then on to Katmandu and the monarchy and Maoists.  The final article is on Tango dancers and somewhat of a relief.

After reading this you might want to go home and just pull the covers over your head.  Don't.  Waddle around to another section and fiind a magazine called "What is Enlightenment?"  The April/May issue has a equally jaw dropping set of articles on the market economy.  It's the perfect follow up to the Harper's.  Harper's is a wake up call if you've slept late.  WIE is the what can we roll up our sleeves and do about it.  The people they interviewed are not Pollyannas.  Several are quoted as saying that they really think there may be nothing left to do but totally dismantle the old system but they are willing to put that aside and focus on fixing instead of destroying and trying their hardest to make the new ideas work.  

They have some incredible contributers to the articles and to the new system they are trying to impliment.  Short articles from Dadi Janki and Joseph P. Milton are included.  The article about Tex Gunning - President of Unilever Bestfoods Asia and his new direction for his company is wonderful.  These are people who are trying to shift the whole attitude of companies.  It's not the current spate of altrustic activity that is geared more toward upping sales with profit as the end result but a real shift to business conducted with the end result as a healthy, sustainable world.  The end result would benefit humanity first, the business second and the shareholders third.  Novel concept eh?  They make you believe that it just may work.  They are however very up front about the timeline and how many people have to be shifted - quickly - in order for it to work.  

Read them both - it's worth the time and I think that they both have something very important to say.

In the several years since my retirement, I have come to wait by my trusty old rusted metal mailbox around the third or fourth of every month, waiting for my monthly issue of two magazines, the Atlantic Monthly and Harpers. Each in iuts own way is likely the best amalgams of intellectual articles on a variety of subjects one can find in contemporary America, and each features a stable of highly regarded writers and authors. For good reason; from subjects as arcane as the supposed imminent fall of the Soviet union based on demographic and economic analysis in the mid-1980s to the recent synopsis of former spy Robert Baer regarding the evils of dealing with the highly corrupted Saudi regime, the magazine consistently offers an erudite, informative, and provocative look at aspects of contemporary reality one cannot find elsewhere. 

Needless to say, I really enjoy reading Harpers, especially under the guidance of editor Lewis lapham, and its articles often lead me on Amazon searches for tomes by the talented authors, which in the case of said author Robert Baer, or perpetually sagacious satirist P.J. O'Rourke, or a whole raft of noteable others. All of them lead to some worthwhile reading experiences indeed. It avoids the trendy, so we are spared the suffering through the latest and greatest mass experiences in favor of intellectual roads less traveled, being grassy and rather wont of wear, makes for better and more satisfying traveling, whether trudging through the snow with my Wintertime Dunham Tyroleans or padding down grassy fields in my summertime Birkenstocks. Just keep on trucking! Enjoy!

My husband and I love getting our monthly subscription. We read it to each other in the bath tub and get all hot and bothered. We often talk about the stories inside and discuss our interest in the fantasies we've read about. Variations has definitely led us to try a lot of fun things together.

If you find yourself interested in trying some of the things you are reading about in this mag, check out Intense Games DVD, it is an adult party game that makes fantasies reality. Really

I enjoyed this magazine as a kid, but then, I also loved Electric Company.  Looking at both now, they seem dated and tedious, but perhaps our children need something that moves at a slower pace than everything seems to do now. Neither of my children (5 & 7) enjoyed Highlights at first, but after getting a subscription from their grandmother, they have discovered the joy of curling up in a quiet corner and figuring out the puzzles and stories for themselves.  It's a magazine with a style and format that encourages reflection and absorption, rather than a voracious grab and go version of reading, that I believe will give a child a better foundation.

My kids love Highlights! It's applicable to both of their age ranges (6 and 9) and is a valuable investment for any parent. I don't know what I would do without this magazine; it keeps them entertained at restaurants and while we travel in the car. Not to mention, it's much cheaper than investing in portable gadgets that are out of date every few months.

I've been reading Glamour for the past three years and it has been a great magazine all around. Glamour covers topics on health, career, finances, sex, relationships, style, etc. Of all the magazines on the newsstands, this one is the most intelligent and savvy for women in their 20s and 30s. Yes there are too many ads like in most magazines, but that's how the media survives, they get their salary mostly from ads. I usually don't mind because I feel that its such a great magazine, that the ads are worth putting up with. I have felt that at times Cosmopolitan is a little too focused on sex and "please your man" articles. 

Glamour seems to have found a nice balance and I don't feel that it dumbs down my intelligence at all. I do wish that they would expand beyond the typical articles. I wish that they would include more sections on culture, travel, and technology. Men's magazines include articles on gadgets and tech, and as a woman I enjoy gadgets as well. Its not just a guy thing. Its not a perfect magazine, some issues are better than others, but I feel that at this time Glamour is the best magazine for women right now.

I just renewed my subscription to Glamour because they are one of the only magazines I have ever read that feature both a significant amount of affordable items (i.e. less than $100) as well as intelligent, relevant articles about women AND men.  

Sure, they have their "off" months, but I really appreciate that ads don't tend to dominate the magazine as much as others (especially for as low as the subscription rate is).  I also can't wait to see the "Do's and Don'ts" every month

If I could only subscribe to one magazine, I'd pick Marie Claire in a heart beat.  It offers everything other women magazine have, including love life, diet, beauty, fashion and celebrity.  In addition, Marie Claire focuses on issues larger than the domestic US.  Being an educated young woman, I am interested in real life issues that other magazines tend to ignore.

Not only does Marie Claire have the guts to discuss issues that are hard to read at times (domestic abuse, prostitution in Asia, weight discrimination, etc.), but they actually tell you HOW you can help.  By listing numerous websites and phone numbers along with their article, it allows me to research the topic further and makes taking action just that much easier.

The cover of Marie Claire may not look any different than any other women magazine, but open it up and I guarantee you will see a difference

When the Armchair Detective stopped being published, I was without a good mystery magazine. I received a complimentary copy of Mystery Scene and I subscribed to it. The magazine is published 5 times per year and features great interviews and good book reviews. I especially enjoy their reviewing lesser known authors and books by independent publishers. My favorite part is the "Where Are They Now" which features authors who  seem to have stopped writing a particular series, many of whom I have read in the past. An excellent publication

The "New Yorker" for food is often how I describe this magazine to colleagues and friends. The articles are well written, though occasionally idiosyncratic.  It is one of two magazines I subscribe to (the other being the New Yorker.)  If the alleys and byways of food are as interesting to you as the grand boulevards, then this magazine will appeal to you.  It is not Gourmet or Martha Stewart (not that I have a problem with either of those titles, this magazine is just different), but if you enjoy food writing about varied topics from a slightly academic point of view this magazine would be a good choice

I unfortunately didn't renew my subscription to the Week years ago due to constant travel and never being around to read it.  I have missed it deeplyt in that time.  Having just gotten the first issue of my new subscription it lives up to all of my memories.  A mixture of news items on all kinds of issues, from all sorts of publications and many points of view is refreshing and informative.  I find out about important and interesting things about which most never hear.  I cannot say enough good things about the Week

Remember when the dawn of 24/7 cable news networks seemed to be a godsend? Now we know that that led to 24/7 garbage (Breaking news now means a peek at the food menu served to the self-confessed and deluded killer of Jonbenet Ramsay, the elevation of trivia to news status to fill time on a slow news day, the absence of any sort of perspective or background, the application of insane levels of urgency to minor health scares, endless celebrity gossip, etc.). I had enough of this nonsense. All I wanted was a brief summary of what was important with some context thrown in. All the truly significant news can be relayed in a brief period of time; the rest is junk meant to fill in the time between commercials. More time spent on news does not mean being better informed because 24/7 news is simply obsession with the same few stories, repeated ad nauseum. I tried the Christian Science Monitor. They have excellent standards but it is expensive to get every day. I then tried this publication. It met my needs. You get a complete summary of everything that was important in the previous week's news with a minimum amount of fluff. Celebrities are lucky to get a paragraph, if anything, in the entire issue. You come away from this magazine (easily read in an hour) with a great overview of all that mattered in the previous week. International and world stories get much more coverage than what you see on CNN, FOX, or your local paper. There doesn't seem to be any bias that I could detect. Get this if you want to decrease your time spent on news but still be well informed. Move over, you stodgy Time and Newsweek magazines

The Week is a great magazine for anyone who is interested in current events but doesn't always have time to consume a lot of media. The snippets of world news are interesting and useful, the more in-depth excerpts tend to be on unusual and interesting topics, and the fun fillers (comics et al.) make it a fun, quick read. We really enjoy it from cover to cover. Nothing boring to skip

Then I had to go get on the computor and found Jennifer's site.  Now I want to get back into quilting big time.  My husband just rolls his eyes.

When the publishers of my all-time favorite women's fitness magazine (Muscle & Fitness Hers) decided to stop producing it, I had to find a suitable alternative.  While it's not as "meaty" as Muscle & Fitness Hers, it's a good, inspiring read.  It devotes too much space to fluffy stuff like clothing and makeup (and ug, even a few celebrities), but overall I would recommend it...at least until something better comes along

LONG TIME LOYAL COSMOPOLITAN READER RATES 5 STARS



I've read COSMOPOLITAN and HELEN GURLEY BROWN since the 60's and never miss a month.  Along with skads of other magazines I enjoy, Cosmopolitan manages to have some fun fashion, fun & hip dating articles, fiction and true stories, and lots of quick reading ideas.  I've never thought of it as a "health" magazine as another reviewer thought of..it's been an iconic reading for the EARLY SEX in the CITY set.  



"Sex and the Single Girl" by Helen Gurley Brown was a breakthough book in its day, letting women in the 60's know that it's perfectly okay to chose career and other paths in life than the one society forced on the women in that day.  


Cosmopolitan has been the singles bible that confirms that it is okay to be single and thriving and adventurous in your life.   I can see where this would irk men that want to REPRESS women,
or WOMEN that have subdued to their REPRESSION, but if that's not you...then keep the COSMOPLITAN's coming.  Catch up on some great women and what they're doing.  Educate yourself on women's health issues,
Find out what men like...a few tricks..check out the fashion, new make up tricks, and new products, and never stop learning.


Personally, I plan to read it forever.  There's something for everyone in it.  And it has inspired me for decades.
Thank you, Cosmopolitan

For $10 a year, at least I can look at a magazine that isn't dominated by SpongeBrand Squarepants or Dora the Commercialized Explorer and that realizes not every parent thinks the Disney Princess pastel hegemony is the only way to go for a nursery.  Will I pay $200 for a sweater?  Very doubtful, but if I did it would be something I could pass down as an heirloom.  True, I may spend more per item on my daughter's clothes and toys than most, but I also limit the number of things she does receive.  I'd rather spend $100 on one unique toy I found in Cookie than give her twenty pieces of plastic at $5 a pop from some toy megapolis.  Cookie covers quality over quantity, style over branding, modern over mainstream and for that I'm grateful

Yeah, some of the stuff is way too pricey for me, but there are some really great ideas and articles in this magazine. I have the March-April issue, and among my favorites this month are: an article about how to diplomatically discipline other people's kids, a gifted child who was misdiagnosed with autism, best adult friendly children's music to download, and suggestions for artistic children's books. Furthermore, there is a price range for suggested products, some of which would fit most people's budgets. An article on make-up features products from $8 - $65. There is also an article on how to make a room habitable for 2 children, which is hardly targeted towards people who live in huge estates. Do you buy Vogue magazine and expect to be able to afford everything in it? It's not for some people, but it is for me, and I hope it does well

Perhaps this is not the magazine for moms on a tight budget who don't want to even daydream about designer items. But it fills a niche that the big magazines such as Parents or Parenting does not. As a previous reviewer stated, this is similar to InStyle. You may not spend $200 on a pair of designer jenas in size 2T, but it's fun to look at ... and maybe get one in a similar style on sale. And quite frankly, some parents do have the money. Having expensive items does not make a child spoiled. Raising a child to believe s/he is entitled to it does. There are spoiled children across all income levels

I am really liking this magazine already because it focuses particularly on multicultural and biracial marriages, brides, grooms, weddings, everything!
 This mag focuses on brides of every color and overall just average brides in general.  There is focus on how to incorporate dierent heritages into the details of the wedding from the gown to the reception.  I also really enjoyed the little feature on biracial celebrity pairs and of course the gorgeous ring and gown spreads!
I definitely recommend this magazine if you are in a biracial relationship, blending two cultures into one wedding (or both!), or maybe you just want tips or ideas so you can plan a unique around the world cross cultural wedding just for fun.  If an all white wedding is not for you in more ways than one than this is the magazine to pick up

Should you try out the hotel hot tub while on vacation or try the pool instead? This magazine has excellent advice for everything from travel concerns to fitness and beauty advice. 

Recipes for natural salt scrubs with buttermilk mingle with the hottest advice on commercial beauty products. Do the new stick-on manicures work? What is the newest information on cancer prevention? 

Dr. Andrew Weil has a 5-minute section with holistic-health advice where he explains why Wild Alaskan salmon and blueberries will keep skin youthful. Is the air in your home as clean as it could be? 

Fun product pages offer seasonal comforts. For summer you may find yourself looking up beach blankets and fans. Special sections show you how to lose weight, even when on vacation. Interesting advice on how to beat stress and why you should find ways to increase the release of oxytocin. 

The only thing in the magazine of concern seems to be the advice section which I read, but take some of her advice with a big pinch of salt. If someone thinks they are suffering from an addiction, they probably are. I'm at times rather surprised by her answers that seem to lean towards a casual approach to serious life-changing situations, although she seems to give women great advice about health issues when it comes to making them feel better about breast cancer or work situations.

I picked up a copy of Health at my local grocery store, mostly out of curiosity. I found myself enjoying it enough so that I will be ordering a subscription. Here's why:
1.It encompasses every facet of health, not just diet or exercise. As one reviewer noted, it is broken down into categories: Looks, Living, Moving, Feeling, and Flavor (it was just redone). The articles in each seem to be well-written and are enjoyable. I particularly enjoy the Feeling and Living sections, as they are something that is rarely found in other magazines.
2. Unlike many other magazines, I found myself marking or wanting to mark so many pages to keep or check out further that in ended up being a good part of the magazine. I, like most others, enjoy getting the most for my money.
While everyone has a different idea of what constitutes a "good" magazine, this one will soon be a regular fixture in our house

This gem of a magazine covers common sense topics of interest to health concsious readers, primarily young adult women. Feature  articles cover topics on "fitness" (body), relationships and feelings ("mind"), "food", and "guidance" on specific health problems. The articles are well written and well researched. It contains delicious easy-to-make healthy recipes, beauty hints, as well as adventurous exercise options. 

Some examples of great articles in the July-August 2004 issue are, the "hike through history" article, the "one minute moves" and the "water workout" article. The first describes hiking trails in different regions of the country, for instance, "Chesapeake & Ohio Canal National Park" in Washington, D.C., "D & L Trail (norhtern portion) in Carbon County Pennsylvania, and "Railroad Grade Trail" in Apache Country, Arizona. The second provides a first person account of a very satisfactory exersize program describing aqua yoga, kick-boxing, and circuit training. The "one minute moves" article provides photos and descriptions of very realisitic and doable exersizes for busy people.

The food section has photos of farm fresh green beans, cut yellow squash, and sections of colorful bell peppers ... very excellent recipes follow. These foods are easily obtainable from any grocery store. There is also a tasty omelet recipe and some fresh fruit recipes which include melons, cantelopes, and honey dew. Overall, this magazine is highly recommended for women readers of all ages. Erika Borsos (erikab93

Having been a BW subscriber for more than two years, I found BW is one of the best business magazines in the US. 

It is funny to see some readers accused BW to be biased. Granted, BW criticized many policies of current administration, because they were against long-term growth of the economy. Some of them were pure political manipulations such as steel tariff, those policies will do no one's good.

Business is business, for those party-faithfuls who spring to defense anytime their party being criticized regardless the causes, they don't need to read anything intelligent and balanced, Fox News will be suffecient

I was a loyal reader for many years, and I've always been very impressed by their insightful, deep investigations into various scandals and national political events. They _always_ knew more than the newspapers.  They've been just excellent, very well-written, and I always felt like they could back up their opinions and their open and earnest political biases right to the 6th level of abstraction, so to speak.  Their pursuit of the Objective Truth, whether their target has been Bush or the DNC, has earned my respect.  

The New Republic kept investigating and muckracking while over the last decade major news institutions have one by one become purveyors of infotainment and pre-digested pablum. 

My sense is that with media consolidation and various new press liability laws, news sources have become air-tight and we've been getting our news from company PR flacks and lobbyist firms with agendas.  In this environment the real investigative work becomes like gold.  Middle-brow types read TIME, but the writers at TIME and others who want real knowledge and context on what is happening on the ground all read the New Republic.  The magazine has been vastly more influential than it's 100K+ circulation #'s would imply.  

But..The New Republic was _for_ the War in Iraq, despite their natural antipathy towards Bush, which I share.  I haven't read them lately - I'm sure they're appalled at how things have gone over there.  The magazine has never been a cluster of soft peaceniks usually associated with the Left, but here I feel like they've let loose their inner Hawks & given Bush the benefit of the doubt (always the _wrong_ decision).. 

So what does that make them..quasi-Neocons? Utopians? Dupes? They're often much too closely focused on Israel, and this also may have clouded their thinking ..along with Colin Powell's great song-and-dance at the U.N. last year. 

I felt I needed to try something new. Lately I've been reading the New Yorker & Reason (it's right-of-center doppelganger) & some other magazines, but I still think the New Republic is an excellent source of news and very worthwhile.  Definately - you should buy an issue on the news stand & try it out

Though I oftentimes disagree with some of the articles written by The New Republic, I cannot help but keep coming back to this magazine when trying to gain better insight into current affairs. If for anything else , the quality of the writing in this magazine is AMAZING and its reporters obviously conduct painstaking research in writing every nuianced article. The group that writes for TNR are obviously some of the best journalistic writers around and its critique on intellecual matters and popular culture are itself enough reason to purchase a subscription to this magazine (if you don't like its politics). All in all , this is a fine magazine

Bridal Guide Helps Make Your Wedding Day Complete

Bridal Guide is a lengthy magazine designed to appeal to brides in waiting and to those women who see marriage on the horizon. This magazine is devoted to bridal fashion and to other things that are involved in making the day special and memorable. Besides the fashion, one can read about wedding planning, honeymoon ideas, photography, and other wedding- related things. 

When you read a copy of Bridal Guide, what stands out more than anything are the photos. This is the main reason people read this magazine in the first place: To look at wedding attire and compare different styles. Models wearing wedding gowns are abundant in this publication and some of the bridal gowns they adorn are quite stunning. To help future brides make a possible purchase, it is common to find a phone number and/or a web site with the majority of the photos. Bridal attire is the main focus of this magazine, but there are also some pictures of grooms and of other wedding party members, with models displaying other fashions for sale, once again complete with phone number and web page. 

The part of this magazine that focuses its attention on honeymoons and travel is probably my favorite part of the issue. What I like is the fact that this is one part of the magazine that can appeal/apply to anyone, regardless of marital status. These honeymoon tips and destination information provide some good reading material for the bride to be or anyone else who happens to read the magazine. 

Bridal Guide is a very lengthy publication, with each issue containing around 500 pages! This is more than double the length of most other magazines and it can make the issue seem a little overwhelming at times. Also, this magazine is saturated with ads. Since the majority of the gown- clad models are, in effect, advertisements for a specific fashion brand, one can expect to find ads covering the vast majority of this magazine's pages. This could be annoying to some, but one must bear in mind that the magazine's focus is wedding planning, so excessive advertising is expected. 

For young brides- to- be or bridal wannabes, this is a handy magazine to have around. It's very long, but it contains lots of fashion and wedding planning ideas to make the big day one to remember forever.

As a reader, I become totally overwhelmed by the sheer number of books that come out each month. I usually rely on friends' recommendations and more word-of-mouth advice, but that's never been enough for me. Reading a book is an investment to me, and I want to make sure my time is well spent. Bookmarks gives me the confidence that I'm choosing the books I truly want to read. I also find that the author profiles in Bookmarks are timely and relevant to my broad tastes (such as the ones on Mario Vargas Llosa and the very interesting Japanese writer, Yukio Mishima, which also shows that Bookmarks looks globally,  not only regionally, for classic authors).

This magazine is fun and upbeat. The pictures are bright and colorful but more importantly they add to the text. If the text is about cooking a steak for example the pictures will be clear and easy to understand and will fully document what the text is saying. There are many many recipes. One section actually has a pull out shopping list and menus for a week. A great magazine. Well worth the money.

I'm usually not one for taking a chance on new magazines (especially if they've been shoved down the public's throats or Oprah Winfrey endorses it) but this is one instance where Oprah gets major-league credit for putting her faith and money in Rachael Ray.

I was impressed with the magazine's layout - not too elementary nor too complicated - and the recipes contained within are delicious and easy to prepare (and you won't go searching every speciality shop in the country for the ingredients, either).  I also like how Rachael let readers in on her Italian wedding and African safari honeymoon.  Unlike other celebrities, she didn't let us know too much information (thank you!) and I'm sure her recommendations of trattorias, cafes, and hotels in Tuscany are worth the time and easy on the budget.

Just because she doesn't have initials besides her name and a culinary degree (she's not the only one on The Food Network lacking this!), Rachael spent her whole life in restaurants and with food and she learned the same tricks of the trade that the fusion chefs on the Network know.

This is definitely worth a look at and I'm seriously considering ordering a subscription.

If I had to pick just one women's magazine to subscribe to, "Good Housekeeping" would be the one. It has many of the same articles that all women's magazines have: articles on health, fitness, finance, relationships, diet, beauty, and fashion. But "Good Housekeeping" goes beyond the surface in these articles, for example, their fashion articles don't focus just on high-priced clothing, instead they show outfits that look like their expensive counterparts that readers can buy for just a fraction of the cost. There are also advice columnists on things like household hints, etiquette, and relationships. Each issue also has a short story. There's also the seemingly obligatory celebrity on the cover and interview inside each issue.

What I like about "Good Housekeeping" are the in-depth articles. Most magazines today publish articles that are only a page or so long, but many articles in "Good Housekeeping" are several pages long. The articles are often about ordinary people making a difference in the world. There are usually cautionary articles for parents with young children and/or teenagers that can be frightening (a recent article was about a sexually abusive male babysitter) but very useful. As with many magazines, Good Housekeeping also has an on-line counterpart, where readers can post messages about current issues as well as enter contests.

Well worth subscribing to.

Good Housekeeping is a wholesome, clean, serious magazine.  Various topics that may be found in an issue - how to raise children, household tips, financial help, or marriage advice - suggest that the magazine is geared towards the middle-aged to the older woman.  I'm married and only in my 20s, but I still get so much out of reading the articles and advice anyway.  

I absolutely love this magazine!  I was looking for a magazine with good, long articles to read, and I found this great one.  They even re-designed the look, and it's excellent.  Everything is more organized, clearly separated into their respective sections, and each page is clearly marked with the section header so I'll always know which section I'm on.

I particularly enjoy the articles about real-life triumphs and tragedies, Talk to Me by Joy Behar about relationship advice, and Peggy Post's Etiquette Dilemmas

I picked up a copy of Dwell in my brother's mod condo he owns and thought, oh, not another boring Design magazine. WOW. I was really impressed with both the great pictures and the range of topics in this little gem. From "chairs through the ages" to a complete timeline of modern design (toasters to iPods!) I just couldn't stop saying "ahhhh"! Since this magazine is not available in many places (such as the supermarket), it's well worth a subscription. There are wonderful ideas for small spaces but also for larger homes too. It would make a great gift for a 20 something that is just getting into their first space. 
(and hey, having it on your coffee table makes your hipness go up by about 100%~!)

"Creativity is like life insurance. If you are creative, you are never afraid, because you can design yourself out of any situation." ~Li Edelkoort

If you are interested in items like the Nissan Actic Concept Car (that has a matching trailer) or you want to discover new modern options for your bathroom, kitchen or garden, this magazine delivers. 

DWELL has a variety of articles to interest the casual decorator or the seriously focused chef. For example, the April/May 2004 issue had articles on: 

Home Cooking - a contractor and his three sons design a home with the kitchen at the heart of the home. 

Cutting It Up - A downtown Los Angeles loft gets a makeover. 

Stainless Chef - Designer John Picard finds a sanctuary with a high-tech steam oven and a hand-carved tub. 

Victorian Revival - A San Franscico couple is the inspiration for a dramatic culinary renovations. 

Trend Diva - Jane Szita talks about nesting and nihilism. 

Other interesting articles include information on houses that become art, short reviews for books on subjects such as living in a small space.

I was intrigued by the house designed with mostly windows on page 45 and high tech enthusiasts will also love features for speakers or CD changers which are most modern. 

Well, until I can afford a 9,500 buck oven, I'll keep reading and dreaming. The library in the April/May issue is to die for! Big windows and shelves galore. 

Dwell is a magazine designed to inspire and inspire it did! Even some of the text is in color. The Marketplace section gives you a wealth of sources to encourage you to start on your own dream design, house or otherwise. The sourcing section also provides page by page information on sources.

"The Wall Street Journal" is nothing less than America's true newspaper of record, a window on the world of business, finance, international affairs, and all the delicious little nuggets of news that would otherwise slip through the cracks.

I am a media carnivore: I am news-addicted. I get my news in hourly, massive slabs: from CNBC, from CNN, from the Internet---and best of all, in the brain-shatteringly early hours of the morning in the form of my daily Wall Street Journal (kudos goes, as well, to my unfailingly faithful early-rising Journal deliveryman). 

With that high praise I also must dispatch a warning to the curious: if you subscribe to the Journal---and if you want to be informed and ahead of the game, then you must!---you'll discover, possibly for the first time, intense agonies of Guilt. The Journal is, every single day, chock full of so many juicy, delicious, insanely informative, amazingly well-written, positively balanced nuggets of journalism on finance, politics, economics, technology, market trends, literary explosions---so much, in fact, that it's an embarrassment of riches. If you're busy---and who isn't?---then you simply won't have time to read everything.

Like Caesar's Roman Gaul, The Wall Street Journal is also divided into three parts: the Front page, Marketplace, and Money & Investing. Page One is my beachhead in the morning: I scan the middle two columns for the financial and geopolitical earth movers---and if I have the time, I can dig into the paper for all the gory details. The news here is uniformly objective: opinion is cut out, the wounds cauterized, and the unbiased opinion itself served up piping hot on the Journal's editorial page. 

Marketplace deals with macro and micro business trends, and is always engagingly written. Sometimes the supplement "Personal Journal" accompies the fleet out; more often than not, there's another tasty little section dealing with mutual funds, technology trends, industry strategies, and quite a bit more. It's a veritable treasure-house of knowledge, and since Gordon Gekko was right---the most valuable commodity in the world is information---the Wall Street Journal serves as purveyor of that most critical, that most precious commodity. And, I might add, serves it up with spice, brains, guts and panache.

Oh, and Money & Investing is a fly-by of all the major financial trends of the day: M&A, economics, currency, commodities, oil making investors shake and quake, big stock movers. All good stuff.

Finally---and I'm biased, be warned---the Editorial Page is the best on the planet, and I always scour it at lunch---always. If you want to be informed---if you want to be light years ahead of your arch-rival, that nasty VP of Finance Hastings down the hall, which naturally you do---you should at the very least read the Editorial Page. It is incisive, delicious, never boring, brimming with opinion and intelligence. Yum.

The Journal is with me in the nosebleed hours of the early morning, right beside my boiled eggs and toast and steaming cup(s) of coffee. And it's with me in the evening, when I actually get to dip into it, at leisure, with my cigar and scotch. 

So subscribe to it, I say: The Wall Street Journal is an important, glorious, massively influential American institution. It's your window on the World of affairs. It's what the movers and shakers of the British Empire might have read had the Empire survived into the 21st century: and yes, you have the news of the world, at your fingertips, hauled back from the Journal's far-flung outposts across the globe: from Hong Kong, London, Kuala Lumphur. Sincere Kudos to the Journal's officer corps: Karen Elliott House, the Publisher; Paul Steiger, Managing Editor; and Paul Gigot, Editorial Page Editor---and the brilliant, dedicated, blindingly talented team of reporters that work with them. Bravo!

For a decade now, not a morning has dawned without my Journal: it is my polestar and compass. It makes me richer, which makes me happier. It is a tasty read. Stop gawking and subscribe.

As a straight female I offer a unique perspective on this magazine.  I think it's totally hot.  I really like the fiction, and the guys are such cute young hotties!  Some of them look a little "mean" for my taste - they look so challengingly at you, instead of invitingly, but then again, a lot of guys in porn look this way to me - this is normal for porn I guess.  Very few, if any of them are over-beefed (too muscular), and some of them aren't muscular at all, which means nice variety.  The fiction is my favorite of all the gay mags I've looked at - lots of first times, nothing really bizarre or violent.  Overall a cool magazine

If you like young, taut, masculine flesh displayed at its most inviting, you'll love this magazine. Supple, nubile youths (over 18 of course) parade their wares, front and back, and look longingly into the camera. Consistently fine photography makes this magazine first choice for those with a taste for the younger gents..

This is by far the best photo magazine I have seen in my 40 years of being a photographer.(and I subscribe to half a dozen).
The reproduction is superb, and it offers a variety of genres without getting into the freaky stuff like Aperture sometimes does.  I have saved every issue I have received as if a book

This past summer I picked up two issues of this magazine and they sat on my shelf for a few months before I finally got around to reading them. I was impressed. The quality of this magazine is higher than any other photographic magazine I've seen. The image quality, the paper, all top notch. This is a fine arts magazine and doesn't (at least from what I saw) spend time with articles about the technical side of the art. Rather, it focuses on individual artists and shows samples of their work. There are more great photographs in here than in any other photo magazine I've read. I intend on subscribing.

I was on vacation in Miami last December and picked-up a copy of this magazine-B&amp;W.It is the best photographic magazine I have ever seen or read.It is the best tribute to black and white photography as an art form. The prinitng quality is equally as superb and highly compliments the new technology in printing.It gives new meaning to the words photo finish. Unfortunately the magazine is only avaliable in the United States so I have had to subscribe using my son's address in Miami. It has inspired me to further improve my work as an artist,photographer, who considers black and white photography as the only true art form and dismisses digital &quot;photography&quot; as not being photography.

Car and Driver is the multi-purpose auto magazine.  It is a hybrid between magazines like Road and Track, which focus on the exotic and the extreme in the auto world, and magazines like Motor Trend, which focus on the more practical.
The magazine is always a fun, intereseting read, and keeps you up to date on teh auto world.  I must, however, say, that it does not do as good of a job at rating cars as Motor Trend, and it doesn't have quite the coverage of the exotics as Road and Track (and definitely falls short of Road and Track's superb photography.)

Car and Driver is definitely the best automotive magazine in the world. This magazine has something for everybody, whether your a person just looking for a new car or a serious car enthusiast. I have been a Car and Driver sucscriber for 6 years now and I regularly purchase the other three popular, monthly car magazines (Motor Trend, Road & Track, and Automobile). By far Car and Driver is the best of the four, testing more automobiles per issue (about least twice as many as Road & Track per year), conducting larger comparison tests, and generally being the most enjoyable. Car and Driver is also greater fun to read as the editors are very prone to jokes and wisecracks, and not afraid to write how they really feel about a car, no matter how good or bad it is. The road tests are comprehensive with a long list of tests performed for every vehicle, and the good points and bad points listed along with a sentence summary of the vehicle. All the reviews are unbiased (mostly), and all vehicles are compared to similar cars in the same class. The bottom line: If you want a magazine that tests more motor vehicles than any other American car magazine, prints accurate specifications and performance tests results on each one, and includes autosport articles and up to date auto news, yet you don't want to fall asleep reading it,  Car and Drvier is the magazine for you.

Alrightly. Folks it doesn't get any better than this. This magazine blends humor with serious reviewing. They will give the strong points and bad while keeping it real to the hardcore player elite - like me! Anyhow, I've read this magazine for a while and I've never been disappointed. The "Ask the 800 lbs. Gorilla" section is a riot. The Bottomline gamer this is an unbiased, not corporatly owned (like OPM, and XBOX magazine) and a pleasing magazine to read. Anyone "hooked" on gaming and looking for great recommendations on must have games should pick up a PSM and get a subscription.

This is definately a must buy for every PS2 fan. Great reviews on popular current games, giving strong points and weak points for each reviewed game, previews on popular upcoming games, and some very helpful tips for your more popular games. 

Note the word "popular" as this magazine will not cover every single game out there. 

Comical captions here and there also make it a pleasure to read. Throw in the annual swimsuit issue which the previous reviewer mentioned, opinion pages and fan art, and there should be nothing stopping a serious PS2 gamer from subscribing to this magazine

This is a light and colorful newspaper. I remember when it first came out .The idea was it would be a national newspaper and cover the United States as a whole. It does in a way and gives local news in regards to all the 'sections' of the country. The reporting itself is clear and very readable.
The paper lacks weight and depth. It has a lot of variety in its features, and clearly attempts to entertain the reader and somehow make the news more palatable.
It's not a great newspaper but it often features fine reporting. And there are times when it does a better job than more prestigious papers.

One of the better weekly magazines that covers world affairs from what's on the news around the world to some pretty obscure things like Imelda Marcos' shoes to life in China, a society not at ease with the globalisation of the world.  TIME did a really good article on how Google has allowed itself to be sensored in the name of finance, makes you realise that Human Rights don't exsist when the dollar signs are being totted up!

The UK edition pretty much follows the USA edition, it's an easy read, and what's good is that every now and again TIME puts out a special edition which often follows a theme, the last one was on Christopher Columbus.

Worth getting a subscription, also you can do what I do, when you've read a copy, give it to your local dentist or Doctor for their waiting room

I am a loyal,long time fan of EMPIRE magazine and have collected almost every issue from No.1. Being a British mag, it differentiates itself from others like Premiere and Entertainment Weekly by it's frank dissection of all movies, and provides a wide range of opinion and discussion. I will always read EMPIRE, and If you like movies, you should too.

This is by far the best design magazine anywhere. The price might be daunting but, beyond being on the bleeding edge content-wise, issues are typically loaded with custom papers, finishes, a fold out poster, postcards, and other generally inspiring material. If you are tired of yuppie design rags and are looking for great work that spans an incredible range (every month), this is it. Not for "8 ways to better drop shadows" types. This is the real deal

not just stick thin!
</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
I have subscriptions to a few magazines, and I have to say, SEVENTEEN, is the one I'm always looking forward to. This magazine has a little bit of everything- fashion and make-up tips, how to be healthy (not just stick thin!), tips for school, fun (not very useful, but fun) stuff on guys and love, teen stories, and important information to be aware of. It's fun, but also informing. 

The models are normal girls, and this mag shows things that not only a size 0 or 2 girl can wear, but also clothing that can be worn by a girl who's size 4, 8, or 16. Many styles from girly to goth are shown, not just one. The clothing and accessories are also affordable, and can be found at stores in your nearby mall. 

SEVENTEEN isn't all fashion. It's really all about embracing who you are and making the most of life. It's about feeling good about yourself and loving yourself for who you are, and not what you aren't. I've used some of the tips on health, skin care, feeling good, and make-up, and you know what? They do work, and are actually helpful (***gasp***). 

The celebrity interviews are very good, and such that you can relate to them. The stories about things in teens' lives are also very good- some are sad, but they all make you aware of what really goes on out there.

It's a wonderful magazine. It doesn't have an overload of ads like Teen Vogue or Elle Girl, while still including fashion (though I will say not as much as these two mags, because these two are almost entirely all how to look good). SEVENTEEN however, has a bit more fashion than Teen People, Teen People having more stories and such (though it is right up there with SEVENTEEN). SEVENTEEN is a happy medium. It's an awesome magazine

Growing up in the church, I've received a lot of Christian magazines, from in depth analysis on Scripture, to Q&A on highschool drama help, but all have fallen short of what young Christians today are looking for.  I followed Relevant magazine before they released their 1st magazine and kept up with the amazing articles online.  I was very excited for the debut of a magazine that made God relevant to specific everyday life decisions and made God seem ever more practical in the way we construct our lifestyles.  God has obviously done great things with this staff and is still working.  Their podcast is also great and really demonstrates the character of today's young christian thinkers who are excited in their faith and are willing to show it.  They bring a lot to hope and pray for for the Christians living in a culture that denies Christ.  I'm not a twentysomething quite yet, but the message of Relevant is important which is: put away with your indifference and go out and make a mark on culture for the glory of God

I wish I could give this magazine 6 stars.  Finally, an honest magazine for Christians.  I am the target demographic, so I understand the style does not appeal to all, but the content can easily relate to anyone who is willing to get past their pre-concieved religious notions and desire Biblical truth.  I sometimes get sick of the 'relevant' move because it frequently becomes used as an excuse for Christians to abuse their freedom as believers, but Relevant does a fantastic job of giving a balanced look at relevant faith.  I don't always agree with every article, but I appreciate the open, honest, and sometimes opposing views.  It is not a one-sided, or single minded publication.  I wish I could afford to get a subscription for all the Christians I know

I absolutely love this magazine!  It is a wonderful motivation for anyone who wants to be healthy and strong.  I will be 38 in a few weeks, and am considering competing in a fitness competition because of this magazine.  I read it from beginning to end, and my husband even reads it.  He always asks if I saw the article on this or that, which is an indication that the information presented is useful and engaging.  If you are serious about your health, want to get in shape or want to take your body to the next level, this is the magazine for you

I love this magazine mainly because I am a figure and fitness competitor. It has great tips.  If you are not competitor and just love to workout, this magazine is for you, too! You will get motivated by every article and meal plans! I do not recommend magazine for individuals who are just looking to get toned and not to cut body fat to supreme low levels.  Oxygen can at times overly advertise the supplements. I used to get Shape mag  but I did not like the models in that mag.  They looked way too small to be advertising fitness.  I highly recommend this mag for those individuals are INTERSTED IN COMPETITIONS!

Based on the reviews I read here, I purchased Oxygen and loved it.  I signed up for a subscription that day.  Two months later I have not received my first issue; but, I have received three "payment due" notices and customer service claims two issues have been mailed out to me. 

I got tired of waiting and canceled the subscription. I'd rather buy it at the bookstore the day the issue comes out than receive it in the mail 3-4 weeks late

After been loaned this issue of June 2004, by a committed, really
genuine Episcopalian, I was greatly impressed! These creative, unique articles captured my Imagination: "What is Power?" by Sam Keen; "Taking the First Step" by Anna Lappe`; "Accessing Sacred Energy," by Judith Orloff, MD; "The Making of a Chaplain" By Karen O'Brien (So like the pages of my earlier Verbatim in CPE).
 
"The Best Spiritual Books" are reviews of 50 out of 300 books by Fred and Mary Ann Brussat! We surely agreed on the first few named: "The Heart of Christianity" Marcus Borg; "Beyond Belief" Elaine Pagels; "The Wisdom Way of Knowing" Cynthia Bourgeault; ++
"The Lord is My Shepherd" Rabbi Kushner+ "The Power of Patience" by M J Ryan!  

I am still in the whirlwind of those emotionally stimulating, artistically written articles on varied yet potent topics of food for Thought and Reflection. Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood

I picked up a copy of Spirituality & Health a couple of years ago at a bookstore and sent in the subscription card right away.  This magazine is wonderful if you're looking for a magazine devoted to putting a spiritual perspective on life.  This magazine covers everything; mind, body, and spirit, the total package.  In the back there are also listings of upcoming events that the spiritually inclined may be interested in.  I highly recommend this magazine, as I always catch myself saying to someone, "I just read this awesome article in Spirituality & Health...

The magazine provides its readers with immediate access to startling developments in science, technology and medicine with a renewed emphasis on how those breakthroughs affect their world. The world is evolving faster than ever. New technologies are influencing every aspect of our lives. An award-winning, general interest magazine devoted to the world of science and technology.For three out of my four years in high school, I kept up with Discover. It allowed me to be geeky without overstressing my brain on very technical, field-specific jargon that I'd find in journals like Scientific American. I learned a lot from that magazine. I learned such and such, and my best guess is from Discover. I usually don't retain fine details, but the pull quotes and headlines from that magazine stick with me.Discover is my science magazine of choice. Look for subscription deals and you'll be a happy geek like me, too.

I love InStyle.  I can easily spend an entire afternoon with each and every issue of InStyle.  It is packed with the latest fashion trends and classic, timeless fashion.  It shows what is hot, how to put outfits together, who wears what, and it doesn't try to dabble in other areas.  It sticks to fashion and I like that.  That is why I subscribe to it and probably always will.  The best out there.  MUCH better than Elle and likely even better than Vogue.  I love it

Playboy magazine, while luring people to open the cover with promises of female flesh, consistently has excellent articles focusing on issues of civil rights, civil liberties, and the defense of them all.  Trancending partisanship, Playboy is a beacon of stewardship over the rights we all take for granted daily.
And the pictures are nice

Playboy still has it; it's not just a magazine for men any more.  This magazine has it all, articles, jokes, stories, and of course gorgeous woman!  Unlike most adult magazines this one has class; it doesn't show extreme acts nor excessive nudity.  It does what it needs to with as little as possible.  You get mostly articles, and interviews with few images but the images you do get are great.

This is one magazine you don't have to hide from your significant other, unless of course they are the jealous type.  Why?  Because woman seem to enjoy it just as much as men.  Hell the woman in it are gorgeous and very sexy but they aren't shown in a un-classy manner, they are shown as woman should be shown; goddesses.

I believe if you don't have a subscription to this you should get one, and if you have a girlfriend let her read it too.  It isn't just about sexy woman, its about the world and life itself.  It depicts what we as Americans love, freedom.  Of course naked ladies don't hurt.

I read Successful Farming, Progressive Farming and Backwoods Home for years.  They are all fine magazines.  But if you want to do a little hobby farm this magazine really fits.  They have a wealth of information in each copy.  I'm really impressed.  It's really targeted to those people who have five to thirty acres, a few animals and may or may not want to make a little money on this side or as minimum have fun but do it the right way.  My first copy was their tractor issue.  Very good info.  And I'm an engineer

This magazine is my dream magazine. I subscribed to it immediately after reading a few articles while my parents were shopping at the tractor supply store. It has quite a few useful articles covering everything from animal health to hoof trimming, to special breed information and generators. I think it's a must for anyone who has ever been interested in farming or ranching, or just getting back to the country life

Woman's Day is a good resource for women. It covers a variety of topics, including health/beauty, diet/exercise, relationships, children. There are tips for getting organized, recipes, crafts and decorating tips also. There's a Tip A Day Calendar as well as a Day to Day meal planner. It relies heavily on reader's tips which are scattered through the magazine and in the various articles.  Each issue tells you how to join the Woman's Day Readers panel to submit tips and maybe win a prize. And even if you don't want to join the Reader's panel, there are plenty of other prizes given away by Woman's Day.

Woman's Day is well worth subscribing to!

Q magazine is a brilliant magazine laden with British humor, bonus CDs, special edition magazines, and more. Being a fan, I bought the Led Zeppelin special edition issue, and it was more complete than any novel! It was about 150 pages and contained full-color pictures, info on each album, concert, experience, myth, book, review and bootleg imaginable. When critiqueing an album, they used the opinions of others and the band members as well as their own. This magazine CARES-rather than gushing, ranting, or offering biased opinions, it gives the impartial truth about bands-new and old

Great magazine. Published out of the UK. Excellent features and great bits of trivia. My favorite sections are Cash for questions (readers send artists questions and win cash)-someone asked Lou Reed if he really performed Heroin for a conference of psychiatrists and won 25 pounds,  NOW (new artists),Instant Karma &quot;where pop and philosophy meet&quot;. Also great music reviews, more than 200 in each issue of a wide variety of music genres. But what they do really well are lists -top 100 albums ever, The 90 best albums of The 90's etc...my favorite being &quot;when rock stars go crazy - The 100 greatest acts of Rock'n'Roll Folly&quot;- No.1 being Michael Jackson statue sails down the Thames (river in london

This subscription is the way to go if you are sick and tired of finding the last copy of Q magazine for sale on the newstands is missing the 'enclosed' CD because some chump has stolen it before you could.  This rock music magazine is superior to others on the market, in my opinion, because it has excellent production values, i.e. luxuriantly thick and glossy paper and high quality reproductions.  As a bonus, the writing is superior and highly imaginative.  An expecial favorite section of mine is the 'man on the streets' section in the back where concert goers are canvassed for their opinions on the show they have just watched.  I like it because the reporter is sure to get a good cross-section of the audience and it clues one in on the reaction different types of people have to the band.  In addition, this magazine covers US and worldwide bands that may not be as well-known here in the USA as they are in UK; often these are bands that we might want to know better.  The reviews section is always great, and usually the magazine will highlight a mini-section e.g. 'Best R&amp;B albums from the 1970's, in which lost gems are rediscovered for the reader who may be too young to remember or even know about these artists.  This magazine will have you finding, buying and liking albums by bands you've never heard of, and who can beat the home delivery aspect for nickels more than the newstand price

"Discipleship Journal" does what many other Christian magazines do not do. It provides instruction, and challenges the reader to be directly and fully engaged in a Christ-focused faith. While others may talk about Christianity, DJ asks you to pursue Christ through responding to Scripture.

This isn't an evangelistic magazine, like "Decision," or an encouraging magazine, per se, like "Moody." It is for the Christian looking to grow in his or her faith by examining themselves and what God's word says.

It is not for the passive pew sitter. This for the Christian who wants his or her faith to impact the days between Sundays.

There is nothing watered-down here. It is published by NavPress, who, like their counterparts, the college ministry Navigators, know the crucial necessity of biblical study by the everyday Christian. Whether it is a discussion about Satan's favorite lies, how to study a particular book of the Bible, or an explanation of what prayer is an is not, DJ is the sort of publication that will cause you to pause mid-page and realize something new about our Lord and his ways.

This is a great tool for two or three people to use together. Even a small group... to go through the articles, week by week and discuss them and what this means in real life. I've even heard of CCD and Sunday school classes asking everyone to read selections from a certain issue as fodder for the next week's class.

I fully recommend "Discipleship Journal." Expect your faith to grow.

This science magazine should be held as a standard for the intelligent general science minded person. Articles are good, not overly technical in depth. At times it gets in its doldrums of articles, but generally it holds it own. You don't have to be a specialist in the field or hold degrees of the same. But it doesnt treat you like you were an idiot. It does at times takes some thought of getting used to. Their 'special topic issues' may be avoided unless you want compendium issue of that topic.Well received for the high-schooler either as the magazine or the website. At least the layperson can be science informed. The title of the magazine says it all

I read Scientific American occassionally back in the 80's. At that time I found the articles (especially the physics articles, which I love) to be especially dense and poorly supported by graphics. The quality was there but it didn't quite get across to my younger self. 

Now, I find the text to be very good and superbly well-supported by side matter and graphics. I would call this an improvement (both in the magazine and, perhaps, in myself).

However, I didn't read it regularly back then, so perhaps the negative reviewers are correct in saying the magazine has been "dumbed down". If so, then it was from a very lofty level as the articles continue to require a reasonable background in their subject areas. For example, the article "Computing with Quantum Knots" was just right for somebody who has read a number of non-mathematical treatments of this topic and who, like me, has read parts of the Feynman lectures and things of that nature. It was a sophisticated and intelligent article. There are many more examples I could give.

My only gripe with Scientific American (and this has been true for decades) is that I just don't like medical articles and the magazine regulary has them. This, however, is a personal matter and reflects my interests not the quality of the magazine. 

I strongly suspect the "format was changed", as some said, because the publisher wanted to improve it for everybody and catch a few more readers. Certainly, I would not have subscribed to the old Scientific American. It was too dense and too boring. Now it is just about right for me.

But that's me. Your mileage may vary

I've been reading Men's Journal since the first issue. I've always enjoyed its mix of content. MJ interviews a wide range of interesting individuals. Over the years I've incorporated some of the workout tips from MJ's fitness pages into my workout routine. I especially enjoy reading the product reviews. The travel recommendations are always well written, if not sometimes beyond the budget of most readers (myself included!). Overall, Men's Journal offers a great mix of well written content

My ONLY gripe with this magazine is that the pictures are like those you would find in GQ magazine: they hire models to show you driving a nail or shoveling dirt for that new patio.  These people use only brand new tools (brand name label showing of course) in a perfect-world dust free environment.  The pictures make it look like it's a Sears catalogue.

Aside from that, the articles are great making it one of the best magazines for the do-it-yourselfer.  I have saved more money from the tips in this magazine than any other magazine I subscribe to.  Most articles can be done by any semi-skilled craftsman with access to a decent set of tools, making it an approachable magazine for the DIY'er.

I highly recedommend this magazine in conjunction with Fine Homebuilding magazine.  In that magazine you will find that the pictures are of real people operating used tools in a real environment.  The articles in Handyman are a bit more down-to-Earth, but together you will get the most benefit

I have been very pleased with Family Handyman since receiving my first copy.  The featured articles are particularly well done.  I especially like how each project they present is well photographed and labeled.  If you want a monthly installment of ideas and guidance that will really help you learn and execute some great home improvement projects give Family Handyman a try

I bought this magazine as a gift subscription for my sister in law. She raved over it so much I bought it for myself and wow. It is a great magazine. We generally read it cover to cover.

It is truly what it claims to be- a magazine about family fun. 

There is a section on rating or planning family vacations. We could do without this one section but even then it is well written and interesting. 

Other sections include family games, outdoor games, theme parties, crafts, and more. Kids cooking recipes, how other families solved problems, toy book and software reviews and even more. It is jam packed with fun things to do.

Many of the kids things are directed towards children who are about 8. However, my children who are younger than 8 enjoy many of the things here and look forward to the magazine so they can find new things to try. My niece who is older than 8 still enjoys the activities in this magazine too. 

This is a great gift for a teacher or a person who has children.

Unlike a lot of craft magazines for parents/teachers, this magazine contains projects that are easy for kids to do, that don't take a lot of expensive or difficult to find materials, and that are very attractive when finished. I also like the fact that most of the projects allow kids to take an idea and run with it -- very important when it comes to encouraging creativity.

I have been a subscriber to Family Fun for 4+ years and I have always enjoyed the magazine.  I don't remember ever being disappointed in an issue.  

I usually will read a magazine once just for entertainment value and then go back later and sort out the articles & ideas I want to keep on file for future reference.  In most magazines this equates to a few pages to hang on to at the most.  With Family Fun I always end up with a huge stack of ideas that I want to hang on to.  What is even better is that these are tips and bits of information that I actually use and apply in our everyday lives.  Practical, useful and fun are all words I would use to describe this publication.

My favorite features include: 
"My great idea" - submitted by readers
"Family Almanac" - seasonal activities and resources
and the travel ideas.  We have discovered many great places that our on our list to visit someday and we have even been able to add some wonderful and educational fun to trips we have already had planned.

Some reviews have complained about the magazine being owned by Disney.  I'm not sure why that is such a problem, but I do realize some people don't like Disney.  The truth is that some major corporation owns just about everything major magazine out there anyway.  At least the Disney company has helped Family Fun gain a bigger audience and provided a fantastic web site as a resource companion to the magazine.  I don't find that Disney is overly promoted (a rarity in the world of Disney I know!) in this magazine.  There are plenty of reviews and references to very non-Disney products such as the Harry Potter series, Shrek movies, and hundreds of travel ideas that have nothing to do with anything related to a Disney enterprise.

This magazine has definitely earned the 5 star rating

This magazine has beautiful pictures, heartwarming stories and as a bonus, a laugh or two.  It covers the countryside of all of the United States and reminds you of a slower, more genteel time.  It makes you want to plan a trip to view the scenery for yourself.  If you long for life outside of the city, you'll enjoy this obvious labor of love

I live in one of the "Red States" in the deep south.  Therefore, unfortunately, quality yoga instruction and teaching is very hard to find.  But, fortunately, Yoga Journal is delivered to my area, providing most of the yogic wisdom and learning that I have received through the years.  However I agree with other readers, I don't care for the ads for cars and cellulite cream ~ (who needs cellulite cream btw when you have a regular yoga practice?) I also do not care for the models they use is this publication, most of them look like adolescent girls who have just come from the Senior Prom! There are a few exceptions here when they do a feature on Shiva Rea, Ana Forrest or one of the Iyengar family members but for the most part, this gives a misconception that yoga is just for young, skinny women, what a shame. 

Having said that, there is alot of good material here, you just have to get past the aforementioned.  There is some very good advice on fitness, nutrition and health, athletic injuries ~ from hatha yoga and other forms of exercise. There is also many articles on Yogic philosophy and spirituality and living our yoga by bringing it into everyday life.

All in all, a decent publication, especially if quality yoga studios and instructors are scarce in your area.

That's what J-14 stands for. It's for teens pretty much yes. If you like gossip, posters, and info on your favorite celebs, music,and movies. I just started collecting them last September and I think their good. I don't care abou the gossip that much but I like the rest of it. I'm sick of seeing those kids off of High School Musical though. I wish they would take them out of the magazine. Especially Zac Efron...blech. Their good magazines though

As a freelance graphic designer only 6 months out of school, I would recommend this magazine to anyone else who is in the same boat.  Not only does this magazine site books that may help designers, but it also gives advice on what works - the profiles of top design studios would give anyone ideas on what they need to do to keep business flowing.

I come from an entire family of designers, illustrators and art directors, all whom love Communication Arts - but that one is far too boring for me.  HOW is more exciting, and for only $30, it is at a very reasonable price

... I highly recommend this magazine to anyone interested or immersed in the graphic design industry. I have kept every single issue and frequently refer to them for ideas, reference, or to simply get those creative juices flowing. HOW's biggest asset is their dedication to helping the reader understand the business side of the industry and the all important client relationship. HOW does not exclude anyone in that they address the different issues agencies and freelancers face when conducting business

This magazine really fills the voids that design school leaves behind.  I have developed some serious guts in fighting for what I am worth due to this publication.  When you are a new designer, you get taken advantage of  frequently.  College did not prepare me to stand up for myself in this competitive market, and this magazine not only keeps you up-to-date with the latest in the design realm, but also serves as a gutsy, motivational read as well.  This is a must have subscription for budding designers. What a relief to read a killer design publication from the midwest

I got American Girl when I was nine. and now im going on my thirteenth birthday and still love it. I think you can be intreseted in Teen People type magazines but still love American Girl. It has lots of crafts and my favorite part-the "lunch box" section where they have ideas for food to make and take in your lunch to school. It is a short magazine, but they make up for it by having the JUMBO summer issue. I think its definitaly worth the money.

You can tell a lot about the readership a men's magazine is trying to reach by scanning the first three car ads. In the issue in front of me, they flog the Lincoln MKZ, Range Rover Sport, and Audi A6.

There you have it. We're going for the affluent but not super-rich young guy who won't even become aware that the Lincoln Town Car and Audi A8 exist until he turns 55.  Well, 52 maybe.

But you didn't need the cars to figure out MEN'S HEALTH.

It's about what all men think about and what affluent guys with six-pack abs (in reality or in their dreams) can generally snag: expensive suits, beautiful women who seem never not to pout, and beefy arms to set off those abs.

To be fair, there is actually a fair amount of *health* under discussion in these pages. But I doubt that's the main reason guys pull this magazine off the shelf instead of, say, DOG FANCIERS.

In spite of an irritating habit of treating women as trophies to be won or dupes to be lured, there is a good bit of wit in here about what one might call the manly dilemma in the modern world. And if it really is lack of *just* the right workout regimen that has kept you from getting all that's on offer in MEN'S WORLD, where there's at least one new workout each month that will cure all that ails you.

Don't mistake this monthly for serious journalism. But you won't need a brown paper bag to carry it out of the store either.

I kind of like it

Men's Health is one of the most popular men's magazines because it meets the various expectations and needs of the modern man. You simply have to know about fitness, dieting, supplements, fashion, gadgets, etc. The annual subscription makes it a bargain and you get so much information for a few bucks. One of the most interesting sections is the one dedicated to bedroom activities. The tips are definitely useful and yet I highly recommend in addition the bestseller "scientifically guaranteed male multiple orgasms and ultimate sex" for the latest secrets in this area. Another key feature of the magazine is that it motivates you to stay healthy, lean and fit. There are weight loss tips, advice on how to eat and exercise in order to see results fast. This is important part of keeping sharp appearance. Overall, I can reasonably say that you will learn a lot, have fun reading it and most probably it will help you up to a certain limit to be a good looking man and great lover.

I frequently read 'New Criterion' articles on the 'Arts and Letters Daily' website. They are usually of high- quality and well- worth reading. 
Hilton Kramer and Roger Kimball the editorial writers, Mark Steyn the drama critic ( And also one of the best writers on world- affairs around) Jay Nordlinger (The music critic) are among the regulars in a solid and respectable cast of writers. 
The great Joseph Epstein also writes here.
The articles in 'The New Criterion' give the sense that there is a living 'high culture' , and this in spite of the often critical stance to many modern cultural developments.

i like getting good stuf in the mail and one day i received this mag from my grandma and i really enjoyed it, seeing as i had just enter hi skool and there we TONS of things i wasnt real sure on...however my mom discontinued it, saying i was too young for it...many reviewers say this, so i will say what many of them fail to specify:

This magazine is geared more for girls who have entered the high-school, teenager period, and deals ALOT with makeup and boys, a bit of fashion, and keeping close to your friends.

i will take a stab at saying its mostly for teens, if not for the younger ones, ages 15 and up...but realy, dating and makeup are things a girls will decide on when shes ready...i have neither dated, nor wore makeup, and im an older girl, and the ONLY reason i am more interested in boys and trying to put on eyeshadow is age-curiousity...the mag has not affected me in any way...except provide a few hours worth of reading and quiz-taking, plus help on everyday worries (ie, body&health, social probs, and so forth)

great mag if you know you have a mature daughter who doesnt change overnite to please people at skool...age isnt the real big issue

if u are maturer (15 and up, or have just matured 5x faster than most girls ur age) and want a mag that is more real life than just made up stories (they have a fiction section), more diverse girls (all kinds of body types and ethnicities), and all around more mature theme, pick up Seventeen...its a great mag, but parents beware...is talks about sex and has real life stories that can be very disturbing...just to warn u...my rents didnt realy like it, but if ur well rounded and have good morals, u realy need not worry...

see y

Road and Track is like the tortise and the hare.  It doesn't move with lighting speed from trend to trend as some other publications.  But its slow and methodical evolution yeilds a contemporary classic.  It's format and photography are faultless.  The editorials are engaging, particularly Peter Egan's.  And no one can match the prowess of technical editor Dennis Semantis.  Quite possibly the best automotive magazine in the industry

As with any profession or avocation or just down right fun habit, it is only as good as the tools you use. This magazine helps you keep up with the latest in the knitting world while still offering traditional patterns and methods.

There are lots of glossy shots of fibers and models with well defined patterns and suggestions. You can find many great ads and reviews of other reading material.

Lieven's article, &quot;In the Mirror of Europe: The Perils of American Nationalism&quot;;is succinct, cogent, and in my opinion frighteningly accurate. My experience as a professor convinces me that we are in the midst of a nationalistic arrogance, whipped by endlessly reptetiive mantras including 9/11, war on terrorism and god, which the majority of my students now accept as truth. I have one suggestion, I think Mr. Lieven is overly optimistic when he comments that the neoconservative empire-builders are not yet the majority in positions of power. I feel their reach inlcudes the legislative and executive branch, much of the leadership of coporate America, an increasing number of Jewish and Christian denominations, much of the media-particularly AM talk radio, higher education, the military, and with another four years of the current administration, federal courts at all levels. I will bring up this article in many of my discussion groups. I think the article was well-written and important, my congratulations to the author

Sometimes the National Enquirer is the only place to find the true story about a subject - for example it broke the story about O. J.'s shoes. I guess you have to pick and choose your articles. Some of the articles, I admit, are useless. However, other articles are interesting and some you can't find anyplace else

OK, the advertisements are a bit much, but the magazine is great. My son has subscriptions to Cricket and Kids Discover, too. He has had many other magazine subscriptions over the years, and this one stands out to me because, unprompted, he has always found fun information that he felt was worth sharing. This magazine was also a favorite with my niece who does not like to read at all. The magazine format is easy to read, yet rich in content

A great magazine that keeps getting better as time goes on. I have watched it from the start and have continued to be impressed by Editor Jason Sizemore's growing tome to the darker side of Sci-Fi. With solid Interviews and strong fiction by established pros like William F. Nolan, Ben Bova, Tom Piccirilli, Neil Gaiman and Brian Keene and talented newcomers like Bryn Sparks, Jenifer Pelland, and Eugie Foster you can't miss with this one

What kind of magazine can you get for that age in between? To old for the "Highlights" or other kids mags and still to young (girls anyway) for Seventeen, Teen People or Young Miss...RANGER RICK!! My daughter is 10 and just LOVES Ranger Rick. She has a great love of nature and wildlife and this just fuels her curiosity. Filled with outstanding pictures, fun facts and great information, she enjoys it all! Highly Recommend for a gift when your not sure what to get

This is an excellent magazine. My young son has been recieving this magazine and has enjoyed it every month. 

It provides factual information in an interesting format. It has lovely pictures. There are stories, crafts and games that all teach about one main theme with the over lapping idea being all about nature. 

It is educational and yet it is not boring or overwhelming wtih facts and figures. It is great for the age 7-10 crowd.

I purchased National Geographic Kids, Your Big Bad Yard, Animal Baby and Ranger Rick for a family of four children.  They fight over each issue and now want renewals.  

How much better is this than a $20 toy for them, their parents and me? How does it feel to have a child remind me in July that he loves his Christmas gift?  Immeasurable.  There is no down side

One of the funniest magazines around.  In a recent article, the Weekly Standard proposed massively expanding the IRS to help pay for the massive debt and budget deficit.  Which group did the "Weekly Standard" say should be targeted for this increased IRS presence (and massive increase in tax rate - for some 100%)? The Entertainment Industry.  The reality tv show contestants, the teen-pop singers and the like.  The article noted that normally massive taxation would hurt an industry, but with all the people that really want fame, that go all out to get their 15 minutes of fame, the industry would continue along (I'm curious if O'Rourke realizes that the tax would be applied to similar writers).  Another O'Rourke article provided the readers with an alternate Inaugural Address by Bush (subtitle: "What if George W. Bush weren't a compassionate conservative . . ."; quote: "The media say that I won the election on the strength of moral values.  If the other fellow had become president, would the media have said that he won the election on the strength of immoral values?").

In all seriousness, this magazine is a very clear detailed neo-conservative look at the issues (neo-con? - interestingly, it would appear that many of the writers used to be liberals).  The magazine does not always present just the conservative perspective, and does not always agree with Bush. Another recent article was by a current liberal, ex-communist British writer and his reaction to George Galloway's testimony before the US Senate. An editorial in that recent issue was all about the dictator in Uzbekistan, an US ally in the war on terror.  The editorial notes that toleration of this dictator and his brutality will undermine Bush's current foreign policy.

It should be noted that the magazine does not seem to have journalists, and few staff writers, most appear to be called "contributing editors." 

It is jarring, though, when I read the magazine then read articles in some of my other subscriptions.  "Variety" and "Weekly Standard" rarely agree.  For that matter, I'm somewhat surprised by how often the "Weekly Standard" and "Business Week" disagree.

After reading a few of the other reviews, I am again baffled by the left/liberal take on things.  This is a CONSERVATIVE magazine!!  Liberals, open at your own risk!  You just MIGHT encounter a differing view point than you own!  Goodness.  The articles are informative, indepth, humorous, and thoughtful.  It's a good read.

Sports Illustrated is a great magazine, the premier magazine for sports. The writing in it is spectacular as well as the clear and helpful visuals that go along with every article.

'Sports Illustrated' is the one sports magazine which covers in a good way all the major sports. It has been a feature of American life for over half a century. One of the features I recently took great interest in reading was its list of the one- hundred greatest sports books.

I always enjoyed going grocery shopping with my mom -- while she shopped, I hung out in the magazine section reading Mad, Cracked, and FANGORIA.  Now, 25 years later -- I finally got my own subscription -- and unlike retro video games, nostalgic 80's cd's, and Members Only jackets, this is just as good as I remember.

It gives the inside scoop  on the up coming major studio horror releases, the low down on independent, if not underground, extreme horror DVD's, and, as always has awesome pictures of rocking special gore effects.

Any fan of the horror genre would love this magazine.  It is a great read and a lot of fun.

I grew up reading Fangoria, when I could sneak it past my parents, that is.  Fangoria Magazine has a total respect for the genere of horror that comes shinning through with every article.  Now you are not always going to agree with everything they say, but you can always expect them to be honest.  When a horror icon is not performing up to snuff, like Stephen King or John Carpenter, they will be the first to point out the errors and flaws.  Fangoria also has the Chainsaw Awards, where you can mail in your vote for best horror movie, actor, ect, and you can also submit a name for Horror Hall of Fame (my guy has yet to win it).  They also spot light horror films that would normaly fly under the radar of most people; like the Japanese and Italian horrors (wow, they can make some splatter flicks), and more independent films that wouldn't be showing at the mainstream theater.  And they have pictures.  All the blood and guts you can imagine in beautiful color (though they have become more tame compared to what it was in the '80s).  This is just a great magazine to have if your a horror fan, I whole heartedly recomend it

A lot of reviewers share similar views, as seen in the recurrence of similar criticism of today's magazines.  What these complaints also have in common is that they can tend to be fairly uninformed in regard to certain issues.  First off, we all know that T+L is for "affluent travelers."  Read the publisher's description, and it will tell you just that.  So if you're not an affluent traveler, then don't waste your money on T+L and stick to Budget Travel.  T+L occassionally has "affordable" stories, especially in their affordable issue in March.  But don't expect the hotels to be to be under $200 a night.  You know why?  Because nowadays under $200 a night means you're a step above a youth hostal, especially in Europe where you pay an extra 20% on top of every dollar with today's exchange rate.  The point is that T+L never positioned itself as an affordable travel mag, so to criticize its shortcomings in that respect is an invalid complaint.

Anyone who claims the photography is blown out and out of focus hasn't picked up a copy of the magazine since 1999.  Furthermore, if all you saw were straightforward photographs of hotel rooms, you'd go out of your mind with boredom.  There's nothing wrong with adding a little art to your photography, after all photography is in fact art, and T+L does a pretty good job of that.  And so what if there's a beautiful woman in the photo.  No one's saying you have to look like her or promising that she'll be strewn across the bed in your hotel room.  Use your imagination - this is travel photography in Travel + Leisure magazine - it ain't Newsweek.  And with all of the other offensive problems with media today, only in America do people complain about too much skin.

Lastly, readers need to understand that magazines don't put in more ads for giggles.  A magazine is a business, and ad revenue is THE way a magazine earns money.  So the more ads they have, the more profit they have, the more money they have to pay better photographers and writers and hire more staff and do more research, etc, etc, etc.  No magazine is going to choose to throw away money in order to not offend its readers with fewer ad pages.  In fact, high ad content is an indication of a high circulation, which is an indication of reader satisfaction.  The more people a magazine reaches, the more companies want to advertise there.

The fact of the matter is that there is no perfect travel magazine in existence.  They are either too service heavy, or editorial fluff, or too scientific and adventure-y, or just a b-level publication.  T+L has its shortcomings, it has its top whatever lists and there's a lot of high-end service in there.  But it's stunning and has its share of well written and interesting articles

Ladies Home Journal has several features that readers will like. One of the most popular is "Can This Marriage Be Saved" featuring a couple that is having marital problems presenting both their sides and then a counselor's advise. Other columns include "How They Met", "Animal Affairs", and "Raising a Family". Each month there is an article featuring a family that acquired a house through Habitat. A nice feature is a column presenting a man's perspective called "Heart of a Husband". There are also articles on beauty, health, travel, and parenting. There are plenty of recipes and craft and decorating ideas. Each issue also includes a couple of celebrity interviews.

I highly recommend subscribing to Ladies Home Journal, you won't be disappointed!

 Rue Morgue is a true horror magazine. You get countless articles on upcoming, recent, and past horror with interviews from writers, directors, stars, and more. There's always tons of reviews on everything from theatrical horror to festival horror to those silly straight to video horrors. Crave more horror on the 'net, then Rue Morgue is always giving you your fill on websites. And what I've always found to be an awesome thing about Rue Morgue ... there's always full page ads of upcoming horror movies which serve as mini-posters, and they're glossy paged. Rue Morgue, you just slashed into my heart and did it right

Not only is it good to read, but it comes with a demo disc, which is packed with demos, video previews, game files, and other helpful and interesting features.

If you are looking for the quality of an APA journal, this is not one.  But if you love the field of psychology as I do, it's a fun and relevant periodical. Kind of a Enquirer of Psychology.  I find it a fun read when I'm relaxing, but be careful of their interpretation of research.  You know how that can go.  It's also got a flavor of Maxim or Cosmo type topics.  Sex, relationships, dating, what do men/women like as well as diet/nutrition.  Overall recommended

Uncut is without a doubt the best music mag in the world right now....but why on earth would anyone buy 12 issues for the price of 15?  This mag is 8 bucks in any of the stores mentioned in the other reviews here, not 11 an issue which is what this subscription breaks down to....whats up with that?
 Also, if you get a subscription direct from Uncut's wesite, it's literally half the price they're selling it for here

I'll get to the point ... if you are looking to stay abreast of what's going on in popular music, including the Indie scene, the Americana world and the major elders still around, this is as far as you need to go. The quality of the writing, be it an in-depth article (many of which are excellent) or a short review (you can expect about 200 per issue) is consistently high. Furthermore, I have been introduced to many great bands that don't even show up in any domestic magazine's radar, although -ironically- many of these bands are American. So, if you can't believe that best it gets is Spin or, much worse, Rolling Stone (how did it ever got to the low point of having Jessica Simpson on the cover ... yikes!), you will be immensely rewarded by trying Uncut. Tip: you can get any single issue at B&amp;N, Borders or Tower Records for the same amount, that way if you don't like it you won't have to mourn 100 bucks

Nylon magazine is amazing, with a creative touch no other magazine has. Based in the great NYC, this magazine oozes creative sophitcativeness, originality, and a sarcastic charm with amazing fashion, art, and espicially music. The photography is pure genius and the layout will just want you to flip through the magazine again and again.

Witty journalist contemplate to the magazine's superiority, who are honest, witty, charming and sarcastic. If you have any taste for underground culture come pick up Nylon magazine now

By far and beyond the best history periodical I have come across. And consistantly one of the best magazines I have read. I have subscribed for three years now-and that says a lot for me, especially given the price, since most magazines don't keep my interest for longer than a year. I find myself dropping anything I am currently reading, magazines and books alike, until I have finished each one.

Easy to read and yet usually contains much detail that you can sink your teeth into. The articles do a fantastic job of appealing to both the uninformed and the seasoned student of history. Ever have one of those teachers that would tell a story and then, at the end, after being rivited by the narrative, you actually found you had learned something in a way that made you feel almost as if you had experienced it yourself? Well, many times I find that this magazine does just that. Every now and then they do get a little fluffy but all in all, unbeatable

A passionate home cook that has been honing her cooking skills for the last 25 years, concentrating on Italian cooking for the last 10 years, writes this review.  My favorite cookbooks are "The Professional Chef" by the Culinary Institute and "Culinary Artistry".  With more than 500 cookbooks in my collection I am typically disappointed by food magazines.

If you like watching America's Test Kitchen you will love this magazine.   The editors cover equipment reviews, cookbooks, develop new recipes in their test kitchen and pass along reader's tips.  If you love to cook, give this magazine a chance.  I think this magazine is better than the original that it emulated.

In the June 2006 issue this magazine features the following articles:

Weeknight Grilling
Rich, Fudgy Brownies Two Ways
Make Room for Basil
A Shortcut to Juicy Chicken
Chopped Salads
Making the Best Quesadillas
Cuisine:  Vietnam
Berry Tarts

For those cooks that like to make everything, they even include a recipe for homemade tortilla shells (a foreign process to those of use without Latino heritage).

The editors include an easy to use recipe index in the front of the magazine that is segmented by type of recipe (appetizers, meat & poultry, desserts, etc.).

In short I have enjoyed every issue of this magazine that I have read.  I would highly recommend this magazine to anyone that is serious about cooking or eating.

I like this magazine and I subscribe to it (along with Cooking for Two and Cook's Country), but I don't think it's perfect.  I like when the magazine offers a several-page article with a formula for pasta salad or muffins, so I can make whatever flavor I choose and know it will turn out well.  But the magazine does contain ads, despite what one reviewer claimed

As a cooking school instructor, I believe there are only four pieces of reading material a home cook needs: &quot;Fine Cooking&quot;, Corriher's &quot;Cookwise&quot;, &quot;The Food Lover's Companion&quot;, and Goldstein's &quot;Wine Lover's Cookbook&quot;.  Your magazine has it all: excellent cooking tips; first-rate articles rating various appliances and cooking tools; excellent pictures detailing procedures; and recipes that are error-free with ingredients listed in the order in which they are used in the instructions (a pet peeve of mine!).  I agree with a recent review stating that the level of difficulty in your recipes encourages stretching one's cooking abilities but not to the poit of giving up.  In the past years I have really liked that you have highlighted a small grower or breeder on the back cover--one on goat cheese and another on apples come to mind.  To all the editors and contributors:  keep up the wonderful work

My husband and I both love to cook, and some of our new favorites come from this magazine.  The reviews are informative, the recipes taste great (and are not overly complicated), and the basic cooking suggestions are helpful.  The magazine likes to pick a theme for the month (or several) which has a couple of benefits.  1.  You can cook a meal right from one issue and it all tastes great together and 2.  You have several options for one basic idea.  For example one month there was a whole article on rice pilaff which starting with the basics (so you could modify the basic recipe your own way) and then gave several variations.  Best I have found out there so far

He's been in the rock business a long time, serving as chief editor/founder of BAR, Bible Review and Archaeology Odyssey; he is also president of Biblical Archaeology Society among many other ventures.  I've read his Understanding the Dead Sea Scrolls which he mainly edited, although he wrote a few articles himself.  This is a magazine of substance, one I would love to have a subscription to.  The issue of July/August 2004 has an interesting article/interview that Mr. Shanks orchestrated between Elie Wiesel and Frank Moore Cross, the subject being how they understood, approached, studied the Bible, from their perspective, which their lifes' work ultimately revolves around.  One, F.M. Cross, comes from a Presbyterian, academic background, the other, Wiesel, a jewish one.  Frank Moore Cross contributed several articles to Understanding the Dead Sea Scrolls.  He was the only protestant to work on the scrolls among the original team of 7 other people, six of whom were Catholic clerics; he is an expert in this field.  And I just love Wiesel's mind, I love how he writes and thinks.  That one article, I think is really illuminating, showing how rich in teaching the Bible is regardless of its many detractors, or fumbling misinterpreters.  It is, as I've been taught in sunday school, G-d breathed, it's G-d's words, it is a living text even if it contains mostly stories of people long since dead and gone.  Elie Wiesel says of it: " Wherever you open it, any page, you know that you are in the presence of something that exists nowhere else."  The moral of the article is neither approach, Wiesel's or Cross', toward scripture is wrong, it just simply reflects the richness, the variety of the text

I don't speak a word of french,and I barely read it, but I love this magazine!!! If you love fashion, get a french dictionary,I did, this is a magazine to savor! I have every issue since Ms. Roitfeld took over and will keep them forever! This magazine is very sexy, modern, french, well edited, up to the minute, bold, well designed(Fabian Baron) intelligent, I could go on and on, I've seen/get all the rest, including Vogue Italia, this edition has all the best stylists, photogs, and editors, I can't wait for the next issue!

I don't know how to get in touch with the Magazine Express Inc. people, but I'd have a serious lecture for them about poor delivery. I always get my magazine about a month late (yes after it's been on newstands for that long) and that's IF I recieve it at all. If you move during the middle of your subscription, you're screwed. It took months to get them to forward them correctly to my new address and in the meantime, the few I missed were just lost. When you're paying upwards of $100 for a subscription and only get 10 a year (French Vogue only produces 10 issues), but 3 are lost in the mail, you lose 30 percent or your money. Bum deal

I'd been a long-time fan to VIBE since they been out. I 'member I first lay eyes on em by checking the covers on 'em but not reading by 'em. y'know. They such knockouts. Yeah they definitely keepin' it real no matter what. I believe they'll be around more and more since them magazines u read all the time like ESSENCE, EBONY and JET. I still have love for them also. But to say VIBE doesn't suck. I'd never been a subscriber since last year and I definitely enjoy it to this day. I actually read the XXL and Source magazine most often now. Same w/ Upscale, Campus Life, just to name others. I luv they magazine to death man, knahmsayin. Ya'll keep it rocked y'heard. Nobody's bringin' the hype on ya fellaz. Keep it UP!!

I purchased National Geographic Kids, Your Big Bad Yard, Animal Baby and Ranger Rick for a family of four children.  They fight over each issue and now want renewals.  

How much better is this than a $20 toy for them, their parents and me? How does it feel to have a child remind me in July that he loves his Christmas gift?  Immeasurable.  There is no down side

My 4ish daughter LOVES this magazine, as do we. Each issue gets pretty tattered while she waits for the next issue.

Educational (for all of us) and entertaining.  She remembers the information given to her in the short and concise articles and enjoys testing us to see if we were paying attention.

A keeper for sure

We've been receiving Your Big Backyard for a couple of years now and my daughter really looks forward to receiving it each month. The stories are alot of fun to read and it really encourages us to learn and talk about animals that we wouldn't if we did not receive the magazine. After we read it my daughter enjoys making collages from her favorite pictures.
I highly recommend it

Yes, the magazine is great...  but up to 1/3 of the pages are ads.  They will shamelessly load you up with renewal letters.  And occasionally, you get a big stinky AOL disk in with your issue.  Kinda like someone dooking in your cheerios.  Welcome to the mainstream media

I have been subscribing to Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine for many years.  I find it an excellent periodical.  The genres range from humor, cosies, hard-boiled detectives, to locked room puzzles, with an added dessert of a &quot;Mystery Classic&quot; at the end of every issue, some dating from the 19th century.   I especially enjoy the absence of gore. The stories are just the right length to satisfy your &quot;mystery craving&quot; before bedtime.  Another kudo:  the AHMM is notably hospitable to aspiring short story mystery authors

The high price is predominately due to the shipping costs as this magazine is produced in the United Kingdom.  A subscription over there runs about twenty bucks.  However, even with the added expense to get this delivered stateside, iCreate is a great looking magazine with excellent editorials.

Top-notch magazine and highly recommended.  Just wish Imagine Publishing would recognize the potential of this product and start producing this, as-well-as a few other of their excellent magazines, here in the States

House and Garden is a no-holds barred celebration of great *design*, primarily of interiors -- and to a lesser extent "gardens" and exteriors --  but also of product and architecture, with a smattering of coverage dedicated to artistans, travel, wine, and music.  

There is a spirit of high playfulness and arch but subtle, airy sensuality pervading H&G ... seems to me it's published by artistic souls for artistic souls ... if you want pedantic, safe, predictable, go for Traditional Home, House Beautiful, even Martha Stewart's Living or one of the other, more mainstream magazines.  While it's true that not all of the issues are standouts -- the issues published around the end-of year holidays are generally thin and somewhat wan compared to the Spring and Fall issues, when staff are doubtless away on vacations and content must undoubtedy suffer -- overall House & Garden hits it out of the park more often than not.  

Like Domino, it's newer, younger cousin in the field of "shelter magazines", it breathes the fresh air up there -- up above the cluttered field of clone publications which all proscribe the same cookie cutter "look" for homes -- and succeeds beautifully.  

H&G is a real little monthly armchair primer on what's new and noteworthy in the field of residential design and related topics ... blissfully free of tiresome, ubiquitous celebrity coverage (the recent cover article on Jade Jagger notwithstanding).  Even the font -- a clean, stylish Art Deco -- nods towards the knowing.  

Highly recommended!

I have been scrapbooking for more than five years, and I my style is rather simple.  However, I recently found myself in a rut, and I began wishing I could do the fancier pages, so I began receiving Creating Keepsakes.  

Although I still have no desire to do a two page spread that takes 5+ hours, this magazine has been great at inspiring me to try new things, as well as just giving me ideas for both scrapbooking and stamping, in just the first three issues of my subscription.  They do a fairly good job of showing the expensive way to do a page, as well as the more economical. Additionally, there are product reviews and recommendations.  I typically buy most of my supplies from at-home parties, I found a very helpful recommendation for a silent eyelet setter.  

Some of their articles are geared towards the more advanced/ambitious scrapbooker.  For instance, a recent article explained how to use certain computer programs to augment photos.  The results were beautiful, but this was just not up my alley.

They also recently did a spread on the scrapooking rooms of some of their staff, and I was very, very jealous!  

I may never have any award-winning spreads, and I probably will never use my computer to augment my pictures, but I know my scrapbooking will be more creative and better looking due to this magazine

I love this magazine,it is my favorite of all of the scrapbook magazines out on the market.  It has an all-around appeal with great and creative ideas, ways to delve into your creative mind, tips and tricks, and of course beautiful layouts to look at. This would make a great gift for a beginner or advanced scrapper.

This magazine is great.  My daughter and I are doing projects together out of it every issue.  It's great also because it is training us to be creative on our own, and to try new things.  We also do these singing lesson Cds together- Vice Lessons To Go by Vaccarino- really fun, and have been doing Berlitz beginning Spanish Cds together.  We love choices beyond sitting and watching TV

Yes, EW has changed over the years, but I believe it's as relevent now as it's ever been.  The articles are interesting and the reviews usually right on the mark.  I read it cover to cover.

I was in the Travel Industry for years, and found CN to be an excellent, albeit brief source of continually updated information on destinations, and all other aspects of travel, whether upscale or backpack. Yes, it is not encyclopaedic, and yes it is chock full of adverts. However, the latter brings the cost of publication, no doubt, and the former allows CN to cover a wide array of topics in each issue. Their travel product ratings are next to none, and shortlists the selection process, allowing the consumer to make more intelligent and cost conscious purchasing decisions

I used to love this magazine.  It still has some excellent articles, but it is true that there are way too many filler issues now with top 100 lists of things I have no interest in (resort hotels, spas, expensive travel agents).  However, on the flip side, it never talks down to the reader - the audience is assumed to be well travelled and somewhat sophisticated - which I appreciate.  I checked out Nat Geographic Traveller hoping it would be like the CN Traveller of old, but although it has nicer photography (with few gratuitously scantily clad female shots), it seemed much more mainstream - like I had already done many of the &quot;dream trips&quot; befor I hit my 30s and the information also seemed much shallower.  I like Geo, but I struggle through the French and it's a lot more expensive

What I like about this magazine is that the articles are unique and informative.  I have bought the last three issues and can't wait for the next one.   This magazine covers equipment in a current mode rather than a 6 months to a year behind style so familiar with many of the other photography magazines.  
This magazine provides me some much needed diversion because it captures my attention each time I have picked one up.  Every article is telling me about or showing me how to implement the lastest techniques from the best photographers in the industry.  
At the beginning of this year I noticed  that some of the  "popular" or "modern"  "digital review" magazines were running the same old head to head comparisons of  consumer cameras that have been out for the better part of a year now. 
I need to see the technology  that is cutting edge or even around the corner.  
So far this magazine is giving me the best bang for my buck.
Good luck

Dwell is a unique (in my opinion) magazine and I like that. Unlike many if not most magazines that revolve around home design, this magazine does so with environmental concerns in mind as well as style.  And as someone who appreciates the less is more mantra, I like the fact that the magazine shows off abodes that are small yet spacious.   Like in the April 2006 issue where Aloft in the Forest, where an urban yet forest feel loft style home on a compact lot are shown.  Using easy and affordable ideas for the interior elements. Yes, the magazine has ads, but to their credit they must screen clients so that what ads are there, fit the style of the magazine.  No fluffy dust catching junk

"Creativity is like life insurance. If you are creative, you are never afraid, because you can design yourself out of any situation." ~Li Edelkoort

If you are interested in items like the Nissan Actic Concept Car (that has a matching trailer) or you want to discover new modern options for your bathroom, kitchen or garden, this magazine delivers. 

DWELL has a variety of articles to interest the casual decorator or the seriously focused chef. For example, the April/May 2004 issue had articles on: 

Home Cooking - a contractor and his three sons design a home with the kitchen at the heart of the home. 

Cutting It Up - A downtown Los Angeles loft gets a makeover. 

Stainless Chef - Designer John Picard finds a sanctuary with a high-tech steam oven and a hand-carved tub. 

Victorian Revival - A San Franscico couple is the inspiration for a dramatic culinary renovations. 

Trend Diva - Jane Szita talks about nesting and nihilism. 

Other interesting articles include information on houses that become art, short reviews for books on subjects such as living in a small space.

I was intrigued by the house designed with mostly windows on page 45 and high tech enthusiasts will also love features for speakers or CD changers which are most modern. 

Well, until I can afford a 9,500 buck oven, I'll keep reading and dreaming. The library in the April/May issue is to die for! Big windows and shelves galore. 

Dwell is a magazine designed to inspire and inspire it did! Even some of the text is in color. The Marketplace section gives you a wealth of sources to encourage you to start on your own dream design, house or otherwise. The sourcing section also provides page by page information on sources.

Here is a magazine that focuses on modern design and clean-line architecture without the trendy vibe that makes a competitor like "Wallpaper" an expensive, hit-or-miss read. What I like most about "Dwell" is its consistency in presenting interesting designs from around the world that look quite livable and fashionable at the same time. Even the advertisements are quite compatible to the flow of the magazine, so much so that they often look like they are part of the editorial. There is a very useful "Marketplace" section at the end that tells you where to get a lot of the art, furniture and accessories complementary to the designs presented. I have often used these helpful listings to find some interesting things for my own place. 

This magazine is definitely geared toward the urban loft dweller, but I like how they highlight homes with families in mind as well. Individual issues are often focused on either geographic or utility-related themes, thus keeping a library mandatory for future reference. The photography is superb. If you are tired of design magazines that seem to be talking specifically to designers, this is a great, reasonably priced alternative for people who simply appreciate great design. Highly recommended

"The Wall Street Journal" is one of the most-in-depth business journals available. It is an interesting blend of current events and insightful analysis of prevailing and sometimes not so apparent trends. The quality of reporting is generally balanced and professional.

Although every newspaper has a political orientation of one sort or the other, the Wall Street Journal news reporting is largely free of politics, making it a good source of unbiased news and information for most people. However, its editorial section is conservative, although thankfully the editorial section is a tiny portion of the whole magazine.

The journal has a lot of insightful business news that every manager at any level should find useful. The reporters cover the various topics in great detail and with knowledgeable perspective from all sides. They are not afraid to cover corporate transgression with rigour and honesty.

The journal also covers various other topics such as personal finance, special reports, business profiles, interviews, commentary, market and news of note for management personnel.

Of the printed daily newspapers, WSJ is easily the superior in just about every aspect that really matters. NYT has a lot more and better photographs, but they are best viewed on a computer screen. There's not much to argue (regarding the relatively conservative editorial page) in this review that hasn't already been written; and one more center-right Midwesterner's recommendation is not going to be of much incremental value. However, as an investor and consumer I can state that WSJ and its website have been the primary source of credible information about businesses, law, finance and consumer products. Anybody that works for a living, has a mortgage or has a long-term savings plan would benefit from reading the WSJ as often as possible. There's simply no substitute

The WSJ has always been required reading for business people and finance wonks, but in the past several years the whole thing -- reporting, layout, editorials -- has been overhauled and the result is one of the best general newspapers in America.

First of all, business, economics, finance, etc. are extremely important to everyone whether their profession involves these things or not. Everyone's lives are shaped by these things and it is important to understand them.

Second of all, a thoughtful couterpoint to the "liberal media" has long been lacking and the WSJ editorials fill the need ... read both the WSJ and the New York Times every day and you will likley hear two, thoughtful but opposing sides of all the major issues confronting our nation and world, from which you can begin to develop your own independent view.

I cannot recommend strongly enough that everyone subscribe to and read the WSJ every (week) day

As a straight female I offer a unique perspective on this magazine.  I think it's totally hot.  I really like the fiction, and the guys are such cute young hotties!  Some of them look a little "mean" for my taste - they look so challengingly at you, instead of invitingly, but then again, a lot of guys in porn look this way to me - this is normal for porn I guess.  Very few, if any of them are over-beefed (too muscular), and some of them aren't muscular at all, which means nice variety.  The fiction is my favorite of all the gay mags I've looked at - lots of first times, nothing really bizarre or violent.  Overall a cool magazine

I've had previous subscriptions to this magazine and I have to say that its most entertaining in many respects.  The fiction keeps you reading, guy's first times are always interesting, the interviews are informative...oh, and then there's the hot guys (all perfectly legal) showing all their worth.  A great mag for anyone that can appreciate the beauty that is the young man

"Time" is a fascinating magazine to read. It provides insightful and enlightening news most of the time. The magazine provides more balanced reporting than say Newsweek. I find its coverage of the wide range of issues it covers including politics, the arts, business and lifestyle, and many other areas to be interesting and enlightening.

So for those looking for a weekly that is largely educative on developments worldwide, then Time Magazine should do. To those already subscribing for the magazine, congratulations for making a good choice.

I love the City. Its particular rhythm and energy is like no other place in the world. 'New York Magazine' captures some of this , and works to be fashionable and fast, glossy and up-to- date, stylish and hip( If that is still the word.)
I sort of like some of this, but a lot of it seems to me trivial and idiotic. And a lot of the trendy stuff is just way out of my league.
But 'New York' often has wonderful writing. I cite here James Atlas as a particularly good contributor. And it tells you things about the City no other magazine does. Some of those things old conservative me will not read. 
But at times there are pieces here that cannot only be 'fun' but give a real feeling why the Big Apple is still the 'Empire State Building( or Flatiron Building) of all the great cities

Five "Big Apple" Stars!! New York magazine is a mind trip to New York City that anyone can take by sitting down for a brisk read of about an hour anywhere in the world. But it'll take much longer to digest the detailed topical sections in the back portion of the magazine. And it covers everything: from a throughly researched, interesting, and eye-catching cover article, to departments that cover movies, the latest Broadway play reviews, the night clubs, and a restaurant  and club section 'that goes on and on'. 

I can literally plan forays into the 'Big Apple' using this magazine, from the latest trendy hotel, the latest 'unique' meal in an established or a new reataurant, the newest On or Off Broadway play, art movie houses showing great independent movies that you probably won't find anywhere else in the US outside of Los Angeles, what artist is appearing at what jazz or rock club and the times of the shows, "cover" or "no cover", etc, etc, etc. And yes, tons of glitzy ads. it's just a "New York state of mind" in a magazine that you can use to plan a physical trip or just mentally take the trip. And it will keep you up to date on the current issues in the City. New York magazine sets the standard for all of those other city and state magazines. I love New York City and I love New York magazine. Five Big Stars!

My boyfriend buys this magazine and likes it a lot. I also take a look at it because in addition to tastefully photographed beautiful women there are a lot of things in it that makes it very interesting even for women. For example, there are fresh articles about fashion, cars, gadgets, sex and even celebrities. I read them with interest and skip the models, which I guess are the main entertaining element in the magazine for the guys. Well, that's fine. I am a beautiful woman as well and my boyfriend doesn't rely only on tips from such magazines to keep me very satisfied but also on bestsellers such as scientfically guaranteed male multiple orgasms and ultimate sex. That's why I don't mind when he lists Maxim and enjoys the photographed beautiful women. Maxim can definitely satisfy the hunger for such eye candies of every man who has a strong and happy relationship without getting in trouble. Overall, it is a very good, high quality magazine, which has a lot to offer both as photographs and information, and I am sure that you will enjoy each issue.

Yes, I know it's weird that I like reading Maxim. But Maxim has inspired me of doing my job. I'm glad that Amazon sell its subscription.
It's fantastic. My husband loves it too. It's not just the sexy hot women covers, but also what's inside. Informative, complete, and relevant

This past summer I picked up two issues of this magazine and they sat on my shelf for a few months before I finally got around to reading them. I was impressed. The quality of this magazine is higher than any other photographic magazine I've seen. The image quality, the paper, all top notch. This is a fine arts magazine and doesn't (at least from what I saw) spend time with articles about the technical side of the art. Rather, it focuses on individual artists and shows samples of their work. There are more great photographs in here than in any other photo magazine I've read. I intend on subscribing.

I subscribed to this magazine at the same time as the Conte Nast
Traveler, and I'm going to keep this subscription and let the other one expire.  This magazine has articles about places not about (as one other reviewer wrote) articles about martinis, fashion etc.
It also has a lot less advertisements and when there are ads they are relevant more to travelers.  It probably all boils down to what kind of travel you prefer to do and read about but for me this magazine is my preferred one

I've subscribed to this magazine for years & I've saved every issue.  Whenever I'm planning a trip I always refer to my collection of Traveler for information about my destination.  It's easier than ever to find the articles because an index
every article ever printed is listed on their web site.  The articles are very informative and the pictures are awesome!  I love it

Although I have yet to subscribe to Aperture, what I've heard and what little I've seen advertised in one of Sally Mann's famous publications is enough to arouse my interest, and I can't wait to partake of a first issue of 'Aperture'.  Feedback from other members is always anticipated and welcomed

I have subscribed for years to this - in my opinion, the hand's-down best, most balanced and useful periodical on dog care and behavior available.  Practical, solidly researched, non-preachy and impeccably edited, it provides even-handed coverage of almost everything that contributes to a dog's happiness, well-being and ability to be a good companion.  The annual dog-food ratings alone are worth the subscription price.  Every constituency should be as well-served by a publication as dog lovers are by this one

I've received The Whole Dog Journal for the past year.  I have found it to be refreshing as it has no advertisements.  It's pure holistic news, information, health, nutrition, training, food testing, and anything else pertaining to DOGS!  I would recommend this magazine to new dog owners as well as seasoned.  One thing about the world of dogs is that it is ever changing.  It's not always easy to get information that is up-to-date, helpful, and necessary.  With The Whole Dog Journal one can be certain that they will have the best knowledge

Has insightful articles about what's hot in the business world.  Great articles on tech companies and wonderful ideas about how to get rich.  Honestly the best thing about this magazine is that it gives an immense amount of motivation and inspiration to the reader.  I would agree with one of the reviewers, however, that it tends to go off course.  It has great potential and is definitely worth subscribing to

I have been a subscriber for some time. It's a business publication that does not focus solely on Wall Street financials - they are there to a lesser degree but this is not the publication if that is what you are looking for. Think entrepreneur or general business topics and that's Business 2.0. It does not focus on one topic or industry but covers all to some degree - think `oddball' as well. Monthly sections include `What's Next', `What Works', `What's Cool'. The articles are cutting edge in some cases, well researched and well written with an informal slant. They cover tech, marketing, product development, product design, ideas, new products and services, M&A's and a wide range of general business topics. You will find out about new things before most of your coworkers, giving you interesting conversation fodder for the water cooler, happy-hour settings. To go even further in figuring out their demographics and target market/s, the ads include autos like Camry, Land Rover LR3, Mini Cooper and even the Porsche Boxster, Laptops, Business Productivity Software like Office 2003, Business Products like copiers and printers, Mobile calling plans, HP, Credit Cards and even Lufthansa airline. So if you are not in this demographic, maybe they're not targeting your demographic. Why Buy: You are an up and coming business major or business professional in your `building your career foundation' of your career. You are entrepreneurial minded. You want to keep on top of a wide range of business topics and even some that are not yet making the news. As a gift for someone with these interests

EQMM is definitely a worthwhile magazine for any true fan of mysteries.  Is every story exceptional, of course not and that's unrealistic to expect it to be.  The stories are however entertaining and you get the opportunity to see something from some of your favorite writers.  I think it's enjoyable to read a short story from writers you like whether it is a surefire classic or just another tale.  To address, some of the issues by the jaded first reviewer, look at it from the standpoint of a mystery lover.  If the publishers only produced great classic books, we would have only a handful of books each year, instead of the masses that readers have the fun of combing thru each year. The pages smudge, but this is not a magazine that is mass produced like People or Time or Sports Illustrated.  At the current price, you could probably only get one to two stories a month for glossy pages.  If you're reluctant to get a subscription then at least go to your local bookstore and buy the latest copy of EQMM and find out for yourself how enjoyable getting a quick glimpse into dozen of mystery writers can be

This magazine is ideal reading for anyone who demands a broad perspective and deep analysis about any current topics related to international foreign policy. Years ago, I subscribed to the magazine and now, as an International Relations grad student, I use articles in The National Interest to address my areas of concentration. The pieces are useful to me because they are so in-depth. I appreciate the pragmatic approach of the writers as well as the wealth of information the editors ensure are featured in each issue. I particularly like the Reporter-at-Large feature and the recent "Conversation with Henry Kissinger" segment. 

Top-level experts on foreign policy like diplomats and intelligence officers, well-known policy-makers, and prestigious journalists make The National Interest an exciting read. The broad and varied views enhance my studies. I like the magazine because the centrist perspectives distinguish this magazine from the many others I read like The Economist, Foreign Affairs and Foreign Policy. I find that every article offers level-headed reasoning; no sound bites, no bumper-sticker clichs. The articles offer conclusions that allow me to develop my own informed opinions. 

For anyone who wants to be up to date about foreign policy, and who wants to develop well-documented opinions from those who have been on the "front lines" of world affairs, this is the magazine I recommend without reservation.

OK, so there aren't as many ads (which incidentally helps its portability), but I've been reading Computer Shopper for 6 years now, and I still find it a great read and a very valuable resource. I read every issue not only for its usefulness, but also for entertainment value - I guess you can call me a tech geek! It's a great tool for keeping up to date with the latest high tech gear - I particularly like the Alfred Poor's Computer Cures articles and how-to guides for us "do-it-yourselfers".  Its features and buying guides are relevant and very informative. Over the past few years, I have bought several computer systems for myself and family members, thanks to advice from the experts at Computer Shopper and their recommendations on where to buy. So, even though I do miss the "tech-mall" feel of the old magazine, I'm still a fan and would recommend it to anyone interested in buying technology

I just wrote a review for OPM, and had forgotten about this magazine.  I also used to subscribe, and had recently let my subscription run out.  I will not say it is not because I do not like this magazine, but because I am trying to save some money.  But the fact is, that this is probably the best multiplatform gaming magazine on the market.

The reviews are smart and fresh, never hackneyed, or cliched, the way a lot of other magazines are (and some of my reviews, sorry guys!).  But the introductory article in each and every magazine, by the Chief editor, always sounds like it has been written by a Harvard Grad, with a Layman's ability to make everything easy to understand.  He has a way of making every article within the magazine all come together.  Never biased, they are not afraid of telling it like it is in their reviews.

I would highly recommend subscribing to this magazine, and like somebody else mentioned, better to go directly to the store, and get the discount card.  After $150 - $200 in used game purchases, it pays for itself.   

Highly recommend!

MC White said:  If you're a gamer, than you gotta have this magazine!

EDIT: Believe it or not, when I got home, yesterday, just after writing this review, I had a copy of the September issue in my mailbox.  I had forgotten, I had called Customer Service about a missed issue.  They were nice enough to extend me a two issue subscription free of charge, to cover my missed issue.  I was quite impressed, and tickled pink, when I got my newest copy in the mail, when I arrived at my posh homestead.  

Thank you Game Informer for continued excellent service and a wonderful magazine.

I have been subscribing to this mag for a couple years, and think it's one of the best gaming mags available.  I have several different consoles, and appreciate that they review games for all platforms.  I like the rating system (1-10) instead of the too-hard-to-pin-down 1-5, and find the reviews well written and objective.  While I have been gaming for years, I am not necessarily versed in computer lingo, but I never feel like an idiot after reading this mag; the writing is erudite but very easy to understand.  I read several different gaming magazines each month, and feel this magazine strikes exactly the right balance between the more serious and more frivolous gaming magazines in the industry.

One suggestion: if you have a GameStop or affiliated store in your neighborhood, get your subscription through them.  For about $15 you receive a 12-year subscription, and a card that gives you 10% off used games at these stores, as well as an extra 10% trade-in value on your used games (sometimes there will be a coupon in that month's mag to upgrade to 20% for both!).

In the world of gaming, there are specialized magazines for each system (PlayStation Magazine, Xbox Mag, etc.), most of which suck because they only report on (duh) games on their respective systems.  Others, like Electronic Gaming Monthly, encompass most systems but only do it half-assed, not really giving you anything to make you think highly of it.  Then, there's GameInformer.  There are many things that set GameInformer apart from many other "gaming" magazines:

1)  They have completely unbiased opinions about the games they play.  If the game sucks, they say so; if it's an awesome game, they'll tell you about it.

2) Matt Helgeson (Senior Gaming Editor) and the other editors actually inform you about the game's most necessary attributes: its ESRB rating (E to M), their rating for the game (from 1 to 10), and a brief introduction to the game's faults and successes.  Best of all, however, they include screenshots from the game- and most screenshots rock.

These are just some of the reasons that GameInformer magazine is the absolute best gaming magazine on the market.  I have a subscription to this magazine and this magazine only, and I hope my review has explained why.

Overall, this is the best gaming magazine I have read.  It covers all consoles, gives sensible (and funny) reviews, and previews the hottest upcomming games.  

Most games are reviewed by two people, adding to the accuracy of the score.  It has a rating of 1-10, 10 being the best, a rating which precious few games recieve.  

The previews section gives you a sneek peek of upcomming games.  Some of them are one page long, some ten.  They all include pictures, and most have an estimated release date.

Also, there is a section on news in the game industry.  Ususlly near the beginning of the magazine, they include news on developers, consoles, and the big names in the industry.  

All in all, this is a great magazine, and well worth your money, because each issue is well over 100 pages

Car and Driver is the multi-purpose auto magazine.  It is a hybrid between magazines like Road and Track, which focus on the exotic and the extreme in the auto world, and magazines like Motor Trend, which focus on the more practical.
The magazine is always a fun, intereseting read, and keeps you up to date on teh auto world.  I must, however, say, that it does not do as good of a job at rating cars as Motor Trend, and it doesn't have quite the coverage of the exotics as Road and Track (and definitely falls short of Road and Track's superb photography.)

I'm 25 years old and new to The Atlantic [Monthly]. Not having read the publication for some twenty-odd decades like the rest of the reviewers, my opinion is this: The magazine is wonderful. It's infinitely more literate and illuminating than most other periodicals. I'm letting my subscription to TIME run out (talk about an "also-ran"...).

Some of what the other reviewers have said is true: There do seem to be an awful lot of stories about war/armed forces, and at times I would concede a slight liberal bend. But neither are enough to dissuade me from continuing my subscription.

So "younger" readers, my advice is switch off the TV, throw out your news weeklies, and subscribe. (But keep visiting CNN.com to stay abreast of current news--this is only a monthly magazine!

I discovered the AM some 2 or 3 years ago. Since then, I have become an addicted reader to it. More than to any other magazine at the moment.

Let's start saying what the AM is not: is not about news, is not about business, is not about nice and colored pictures.

The AM has two main focuses. One is current affairs, with a special focus on the macro conditions of the US (mainly economy and politics) and international affairs. The other one is the arts, with a special focus in reviewing high-quality (and sometimes rare) books.

I like the AM for its focus in current affairs. In this monthly you will read long articles about issues like, to cite some examples that come to mind:
- Simulation of a principals meeting to discuss alternatives to engage with North Korea
- War game of an attack to Iran
- Presidential candidates, their lives and their campaign strategies
- State of affairs of the American educational system
- Potential causes of an eventual economic crisis in the US

The AM sits in the same "hall of fame" as The Economist and Foreign Affairs. The main differences are that The Economist has a relatively short time frame and thus focuses on the news of the week and what they mean for the mid term. Foreign Affairs, on the other hand, is more scholarly in nature. The AM sits somehow in the middle. It is written mainly by senior journalists (so it's less scholarly) and its monthly focus allows it to disentangle itself from the relative "sameness" of every week's news. The AM goes beyond the "futility" of news reporting but stops before it gets into the "boringness" of scholarly writing.

If you want to enrich your view of the world with a quality monthly, if you are open-minded and are willing to read new points of view, if you want to get closer to the real issues behind foreign and economic policy, the AM is for you.

On the other hand, if you have more "short-term" preocupations, if you are more "closed" than open to new points of view, or if you want to look at international and economic matters with a more scientific approach, then the AM is not for you.

Again, as I said, the AM also has an "Arts" section. It's very good but it's not the reason why I buy it. Other may

I first came across Taste of Home Magazine about 10 years ago. Some friends of mine were quite the experimental couple who loved to try out new recipes. As the recipient of tasty appetizers, dips, and desserts, I asked them for the recipes. It was then that they shared this magazine with me...and I've been a subscriber ever since!

Each magazine features several special features, as well as mainstay departments such as Potluck Pleasers, My Mom's Best Meal, Getting in the Theme of Things, and Super Snacks and Appetizers. Arguably the best part of this magazine is their clip-and-keep section of recipes which feature color photos of the dish. Just cut out the recipe, and ouila! it's ready for your recipe box.

Other information-packed sections include Ask Our Food Editor, Touring Country Kitchens, Ted's Toothpick Contest, Lively Leftovers, and more. Each issue also features a recipe contest to win cold, hard cash. 

Some of the great recipes that are in the most recent issue include:

Swiss-Stuffed Porkchops
Open-Faced Turkey Tacos
Spinach Shrimp Fettuccine
Coffee 'n' Cream Brownies
Cucumber Potato Salad
Asparagus Chicken Crepes
Hearty Jambalaya
Barvarian Strawberry Pie

and many more. Besides being tasty dishes, one of the great things about the recipes in Taste of Home is that they don't call for some exotic ingredients. Rather, they feature ingredients that can be found in any department store...even if you live in an out-of-the-way rural area!

Some of the recipes aren't exactly "quick", which is why I give it four stars. There are certainly quite a few quick and easy recipes, but there are also some that take quite a bit of prep work. If you're looking for a magazine with mostly quick recipes, try their sister publication, Quick Cooking (I subscribe to that one, as well...and actually like it better.)

Taste of Home has NO ads (amazing!), so it's nice that the magazine is chock full of recipes and information--not fillers and ads. This magazine also is very "country", so if you're looking for something trendy and cosmopolitan, this mag may not be for you. But if you like down-home country cookin', you'll likely love this magazine

Imagine making a Beehive Cake or a Honey-Citrus Iced Tea. When looking through this magazine you need a good cup of tea and a pair of scissors. You will be cutting out a lot of recipes! In fact, I'm sitting here cutting out recipes in between typing. There are 16 pages of recipes in a "card" format. 

The Favorite Meal section and Cooking for One or Two is always of interest. It shows you how to put an entire meal together and all the recipes are included. 

There is also a section where you can view enviable country kitchens. Then you can learn how to make ordinary foods extraordinary. Add curry powder to chicken salad or add brewed coffee to cookie dough. 

The "Men Who Run the Range" section is a series featuring men who love to cook and then you can also find out what people are eating in various states across the country. These are ideas and recipes from real cooks across America.

One time I looked in the "Does Anyone Have...?" section and found a note about a woman who was looking for specific items. After sending her a small box, she then reciprocated and sent me the most beautiful framed pressed flowers. It is a fun section where you can read about recipes people are looking for and if you have the recipe, there is an address where you can mail the item. I recently learned how to make rosemary crackers and someone is looking for a recipe for various crackers. 

This magazine also has info on cooking schools all over the country. You could also be a Field Editor and share your recipes, cooking tips and other ideas with the home-office staff. You could literally end up in this magazine!

Some of the delicious recipes I've been clipping from this magazine include: 

Grilled Sirloin Steak
Crispy Fried Chicken
Herbed Seafood Skewers
Chicken with Rosemary
Vegetable Cheese Tortellini
Grilled Turkey Burgers
Beehive Cake
Honey Citrus Iced Tea

Tonight I made a chicken dish with homemade stuffing and a mushroom gravy that my husband really loved. I think this magazine inspires me to cook more and I have never read this magazine without tearing out pages galore. Now I'm dreaming about the Pear Crisp with Lemon Sauce and the Raspberry Cheesecake Pie.

Mr. Hayek apparently despises free thought.  Furthermore, his ignorance of libertarian philosophy is clear; discounting his opinion is appropriate.  I'm guessing he is a Republicrat and finds the socialist ideas found in the corrupt two party system satisfying.  Funny considering his namesake, Frederich Hayek, is one of the greatest libertarian thinkers of all time and one of my personal heros.  

But, I digress:  Reason magazine has been in my mailbox every month for well over 20 years and I would buy a lifetime subscription if I could.  Not every issue is a five star issue, but on the whole Reason is the most interesting periodical on the market.  That said, Reason has dropped a notch in quality ever since the brilliant Virginia Postrel left the editor's post several years ago.  She is a true intellectual and kept Reason at a consistently high level.  I still love to read my issue every month and while I don't always agree with the positions I am always stimulated

GQ, A.K.A Gentlemen's Quarterly is a men's magazine like Cosmopolitan is to women.  GQ has a broad range of contents in it's magazine from: in-depth articles from movie and rock stars, fashion, food and drink, technology, movies, music, etc.  The magazine gives equal attention to all the contents except fashion which is more abundant throughout the magazines pages.  All in all, GQ is a great men's magazine with plenty of fashion news/tips, and also delves in other men's interests as stated above

Like one commentor said..."The Truth Hurts". It does...If you're happy with your Martha Stewart and Scott Peterson news, do not buy this magazine. If you want the real dirt, left or right wing...this is it. They shoot from the hip. 

 If you want the truth and not what you will see on the mainstream media, this is the magazine. They are well known to publish stories that the NY Times is afraid to publish. As a matter of fact, most of the writers on Mother Jones and The Nation used to write for the Times. And I just heard last week two stories written by NY Times writers that they're publishers wouldn't print. So guess who did? If you doubt me, look up the 25 Most Censored Stories of 2004 and 2005

Excellent independent research!  Investigative journalism at its best.  It is neither a liberal nor a conservative publication, for neither Republicans nor Democrats are spared.  Politicians make a lot of claims, and Mother Jones looks beyond their words to see if they actually put them into action.  As you will see when you read Mother Jones, many politicians (both Democrats and Republicans) do not "put their money where their mouth is." Also, ignore the reviews saying that it is biased.  Apparently, they consider facts that are inconvenient and run counter to their beliefs to be biased.  What is interesting is that if they came across an article in Mother Jones that supported their beliefs, that they agreed with, then they would probably say that the article was impartial and fair.  Hey, the truth hurts sometimes.   Finally, the reviewers claiming that this is a liberal magazine   
because it talks about Bush so often are misguided.  Mother Jones does so many articles on Bush because he makes so many claims and says so many things that are not supported by his actions.  He is an easy target.  They do articles on Kerry and others too.

I had heard of "Books & Culture."  I had never read it.  And then a good friend from college called one afternoon and told me he was sending me a gift subscription.  I've never enjoyed a periodical this much.  It has given me hope.  

When George W. Bush was reelected the word "Evangelical" was spoken across the country in blame.  Regardless of your political stance, the point is that the Evangelicals were seen as stupid enough to reelect what much of the rest of the nation saw as a poor president.  Even today, "Evangelical" is often used to connote backwardness or stupidity.  But "Books & Culture" blows this assumption out of the water.  

Have you stumbled across another publication that will voice God-fearing perspectives on gender roles in the church, current philosophy and theology, current film and literature, politics, economics, and cultural phenomena such as the internet?  This is "Books & Culture's" most recent issue, thoughtfully done and honestly written, even when the conclusions reached seem somewhat outside of the traditional conception of things.  

As a subculture, we love answers.  But it seems we are entering a new period of growth in our communities, one in which questions will be equally important and appropriately valued.  Why not begin with the tough questions?  You'll find many of them in "Books & Culture."  

ALong

P.S. Dennis, if you ever read this, thanks for the subscription, bud.

Fantasy&ScienceFiction magazine has been around since 1949, and is in my opinion one of the better SciFi and fantasy mags on the market. It has a proven track record of publishing outstanding short stories, novellas, and novelettes that have later gone on to win Hugo, Nebula, and dark fantasy awards, which brings me to the 2006 June issue of the magazine: The June issue features an outstanding and very creepy novella entitled Hallucigenia by Laird Barron. I predict an award for this chilling novella, which will be just another in a long and esteemed list of award worthy tales from Fantasy&ScienceFiction.
Barron's story could be classed as a Cthulhu Mythos tale, although no where does the author allude to H.P. Lovecraft's works. It is simply that the recurring theme is a recognizable one to us Mythos fans.
Highly recommended reading, and worth the subscription price.

With its cheap pricetag and thick size, Fantasy & Science Fiction is definately one of the best. It splits it pages into fantasy & science fiction stories and novellas with a few common columns between (book reviews and strange facts). If you write fantasy or science fiction, pick magazine up

There's certainly a lot to hate about Wine Spectator - and, for that matter, Wine Advocate. Many winemakers decry the existence of both magazines, and usually lay the blame entirely at Robert Parker's doorstep for making the 100-point rating system an industry standard.

Wine Spectator's scores have gotten better with time, as have their articles. They've shied away from California "glitz" and have looked more into food. Also, the education classes that they list on their website are becoming increasingly more helpful.

Apparently they listened to much of the criticism and worked toward creating a more respected magazine. I think they've done well.

The Wine Spectator is one of those magazines designed to reassure you that you're rich or that you soon could be, all in the context of a shared love for the fruit of the vine.

There's lots of deadly serious material in this glossy, pleasing publication. But if you're a lover of wine who is *not* rich - the category includes this reviewer - you need to learn to take it with a sense of humor. Just enjoy the game.

That game includes a travelogue of the world's wine regions as well as the possibility of gaining a decent education via month-by-month reading in viticulture and wine appreciation itself. This reader is in it for the long haul - I hope to enjoy good wine at an affordable cost for the duration of this earthly slog - and the Wine Spectator is my companion along the way.

My job takes me out for many dinners in various parts of the world that include wine-splendored places like France, South Africa, Chile, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand and - of course - Northern California.  But with wineries now in 49 of the USA's fifty states, what's *not* a wine region these days?  

On those business treks, I find myself out for dinner as often as not. It's personally satisfying to know just enough to order a Pinotage in Capetown, since only South Africa produces this varietal, or to opt for one of Argentina's persuasive Malbecs because they're just *that* good.  We're not talking wine snobbery here, just satisfaction at the margins of life's all too margin-less journeys.

If this sounds like your game, the Wine Spectator may be a worthwhile investment. Even if not, consider splitting a subscription with a colleague. That's what I do. At half the price, I get a fine magazine and avoid burdening my bookshelves with one more heavy, beautiful, pleasant magazine. Life can deal you worse

I subscribed to WS for a couple years in the late 90s, and loved the magazine. It keeps a balance between reviews of wines both new (which is the main emphasis) and older vintages, and background stories on vintners and so on. The writers are almost all very good (and I'm a professional writer myself) -- only one of them do I dislike and he doesn't review the wines. Both the wine connoisseur and the novice can profit from reading this publication. I only dropped the subscription because I moved and the collection, no issue of which I wished to discard, was occupying more and more space on my bookshelves. 

Now I subscribe to the online edition so I can check ratings before I buy a wine. The WS, in addition to Parker and other reviewers, perform an essential service for critical consumers who can't otherwise judge whether a bottle is worth the price asked. And we need WS and Parker and all to tell us when the best reds are ready to drink -- some really great ones are not mature for more than a decade. I drank the highly rated Chateau Canon 1982, for which I'd paid over $100, 17 years after harvest, and my group could tell it wasn't ready -- still closed down. Sure enough, if I had read Spectator carefully, I'd have picked another bottle for that occasion because they said it wasn't yet mature.

Robert Parker has the reputation for being more influential for high-end wines, but Wine Spectator's scores are generally pretty close to his. And they review a broader spectrum, as noted by other commentators below. WS will often steer you to excellent buys for under $15, or even under $10. If you get only one of these per month, or steers you away from a very overpriced bottle, the subscription (about $50) pays for itself

This is a light and colorful newspaper. I remember when it first came out .The idea was it would be a national newspaper and cover the United States as a whole. It does in a way and gives local news in regards to all the 'sections' of the country. The reporting itself is clear and very readable.
The paper lacks weight and depth. It has a lot of variety in its features, and clearly attempts to entertain the reader and somehow make the news more palatable.
It's not a great newspaper but it often features fine reporting. And there are times when it does a better job than more prestigious papers.

I like their editorial pages too and my favorite part is the Life section. I love the color pics and the celebrity news and the reality TV news synopsis.
I used to only read this paper when travelling or on vacation. Now I am reading it daily and they may have a subscriber for life

Whether you are a technical guru or someone who's emphasis is on the words, any serious filmmaker who takes his or her craft seriously will love American Cinematographer.  The official magazine of the American Society of Cinematographers, this magazine gives you in depth interviews with DPs and Directors on the technical approach towards the shooting of the picture.  They cover not just lab soups and lighting techniques, but also the approach to the script, design notes on how to visually approach the script - in other words, a great detailed overview of how this particular crew of filmmakers went about creating the visual language of the film.  And not just film - as technology advances, and more films are shot on video, this magazine gives the same great coverage to those pictures as well - from Star Wars to Anniversary Party.  While it's true that there are only so many films that AC can cover each issue but I think you'll end up feeling like I do - that I wish they could cover them all

I am a big fan of this magazine, but even more so of the "free" cd--when it is good, it is very good.  So I finally subscribed despite the stiff price.  Two issues came, I was happy, then a third without the cd, and then...no more.  After many calls and complaints, Amazon finally secured a partial refund--not exactly what I wanted.  Here's hoping that the delivery problems can be worked out--maybe an opaque wrapper

This is simply one of the best movie magazines on the market. You can always be sure to be updated on the latest movies and dvd releases, and it's nice that the crew of Empire doesn't take themselves too seriously; the articles are well written but keeps the humour intact as well, where other movie magazines seem to be too keen on showing how intellectual they are. Unfortunately it's rather expensive here in Denmark, but it's worth the price

About two years ago, I became a subscriber to Shape, mainly because I had received it for free as part of a package deal with another magazine.  I had always liked browsing through issues of Shape in the supermarket, and I thought that being a subscriber would help support my fitness goals.  Overall, I have enjoyed Shape and found it to be useful, but there definitely are some negatives, and the magazine might not be for everyone.

But first the good.  Like many others have mentioned, what I most enjoy about Shape is their real-life weight stories featuring a nice variety of women, some of whom actually needed to *gain* weight in order to be healthy.  I also love their relatively new feature in which they follow one of their own staffers on a year-long weight loss journey.  Many of their other regular features are also excellent, particularly the body part-focused strength exercises and other how-to exercise guides.  And I especially like that Shape uses "Reader Models" with so many of their articles--real life women of various ages (although admittedly, mostly in the 25-35 range) with normal, healthy, strong bodies.  Finally, their featured exercise plans each month often offer some unique variations on traditional exercises, and the recipes are often quite good as well.

The main negative has already been brought up by many others here:  the use of too-skinny, not overtly fit or strong models to illustrate much of the magazine.  I find this extremely disappointing; I understand that to sell magazines, the models probably have to conform to some traditional standards of attractiveness, but those of us buying the magazine want to see women who are not only fit but also strong--show us some muscles now and then!  As I said above, the reader models are great; the women are usually quite fit, but they have muscles and curves too, which is wonderful to see.  Shape MAY be trying to make some improvements in this area, as the last few covers have featured famous women who do exercise (such as Denise Richards), but they still have a long way to go.  And while they're at it, I hope they will return to having their cover models dress in fitness wear, not bathing suits!  They can still show off their model's physique AND showcase cute fitness wear at the same time.  Similarly, I would like to see the magazine get rid of the fashion segment at the end *unless* they start focusing it on exercise clothing, not haute couture.

If you are overweight and/or new to exercising, you may find the magazine discouraging, but if you can get past some of the negatives, it can also be inspiring.  I think it's up to each individual to determine whether a magazine like this is likely to hurt or help her fitness efforts; for me, it is helpful, but this definitely might not be the case with everyone

I subscribe to Entertainment Weekly, Premiere, and any magazine with a photo of Johnny Depp or hobbits on the cover, but Scr(i)pt is my favorite magazine.
Every issue of Scr(i)pt has articles by the screenwriters of movies that are just opening, explaining something about how the movie was written and featuring excerpts from the screennplay of that movie.  These are triply helpful, as they (1) provide insight into how a successful screenwriter works his craft, (2) supply brief examples of what the movie you just saw (or are about to see) looks like on the page, and (3) are a useful tool in deciding which movie to go see Saturday night.
Each issue also has articles of the more general How To... variety, although these range from How To Write Great Scenes/Characters to How To Pitch To Studios to Why Studio Execs Are Using Your Script To Wrap Fish.  For a while there was a series of articles that were simply a compilation of all the genre cliches, written in the hopes that if you knew what they were you could avoid them; they were invariably hilarious.  These How To/Writing Advice articles are often extremely funny (this is not meant as an insult--they are meant to be funny as well as helpful).
Finally, every issue has the news on sales, contest winners, and whatnot that is essential for any working screenwriter, with a generous helping of heartwarming success stories to keep your spirits up while you're waiting to hear from the studios.
I highly recommend this magazine.  Enjoy

I have read this mag thru and thru, and for some 20 + years now it has continued to be at the top of the crop.  It is the most superbly laid out and designed magazine with excellant content,that I have ever seen.  To be totally honest, I would much rather read and browse this any day over "Print" magazine.  This is almost like a graphic design book, that just gets published every 2 months where the best designers in the world are given each about 30 pages to just go nuts on.  I found it deep in the stacks of the university library one day and have been hooked ever since...also for those of you who can read/write japanese, german, and english you can have your pick while reading..

Inc. magazine is a publication designed to guide small businesses on their path to prosperity. With Inc., you get timely advice on taxes, marketing, financing, and many other important considerations and challenges that business owners face every day.

Probably the strongest point of Inc. is the way it presents important information to readers. The authors of this magazine get directly to the point. They don't waste your time with petty discussions and attempts to soften the blow of an undesirable fact. Even when the news is bad, like with regulations, taxation, etc., Inc. lets you have it in a direct manner. This is good, because I get annoyed by magazines that try to ease the reader into hearing some unwelcome news and then try to downplay the facts. Inc. writers are direct, and I respect them for that.

If there were some criticisms to be made about this magazine, I can think of only two: The lack of articles geared toward startup businesses and the tendency of the magazine to highlight success stories that, while nice to read about, present personal success that is a little out of reach of most business owners. Inc. is designed for small businesses that are already established and need some guidance for growth. This is fine, but I would like it a little better of there were more articles on getting a new business off the ground. And, every now and them the magazine goes off on a tangent and interviews someone who is very rich. Again, this is ok, but I would prefer to read about ordinary people who are only moderately well- off because these stories and the individual level of success they portray are more realistic. 

Still, Inc. is a very good publication for small business owners. It provides some good, timely advice on how to help your young business grow and how to handle legal issues and concerns. The price to subscribe is low, too, making Inc. magazine a must for owners of small, growing companies.

This is the best PC gaming magazine you'll find anywhere. It covers the lastest games and hardware. A bonus, the issue comes with a free demo disc every month. Although PC games are fading out of the picture, XBOX is a good way to keep them alive. This magazine covers everything you need to know. It's the best thing to do if you want the most out of your PC. A good choice to start with is this. Get this magazine, your won't regret it

Most of this magazines travel articles and ads are not targeted at someone like me.  I'm a homemaker with a limited budget.  I don't travel much or am in the market for the fancy things they advertise.  However,  I just renewed my subscription becuase when I have tried the recipes in the magazine they were really wonderful.  I've added every recipe I've tried from Gourmet to my 'keeper' recipe binder.   I admit, the dishes were harder to make but the results were definitely worth the trouble

I am a serious foodie that loves to cook and is always looking for new ways to shake up the meals that I prepare for my family.  The beauty of "Gourmet" is that they do not concentrate on the cuisine of one culture.  I also appreciate that they provide articles on both the best methods, and on quick methods and dishes.  I have read "Gourmet" off and on for at least 20 years.  The magazine has changed somewhat during that time.  The focus has shifted to more of a lifestyle magazine than a pure cooking magazine.

The features of the June 2006 edition are as follows:

Tiki Time:  a collection of Polynesian food and drink
We are Family:  recipes for a summer party
A Greece Less Traveled:  northwestern Greece travel and recipes

In the section, Seasonal Kitchen, there is a very well done article on salads.  The roasted vegetable panzanella is fantastic.

In the Gourmet Everyday section, I always enjoy the three regular articles:  Quick kitchen (30 minutes meals), Five Ingredients, and 10 minute mains.  These are always tasty and usually all quick.

If you are a foodie, and/or you want to be this magazine is a nice starting point.  I would suggest that you pick up a couple of issues on the newsstand to confirm that this magazine is for you before subscribing.  I highly recommend this magazine for budding home chefs.

not just stick thin!
</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
I have subscriptions to a few magazines, and I have to say, SEVENTEEN, is the one I'm always looking forward to. This magazine has a little bit of everything- fashion and make-up tips, how to be healthy (not just stick thin!), tips for school, fun (not very useful, but fun) stuff on guys and love, teen stories, and important information to be aware of. It's fun, but also informing. 

The models are normal girls, and this mag shows things that not only a size 0 or 2 girl can wear, but also clothing that can be worn by a girl who's size 4, 8, or 16. Many styles from girly to goth are shown, not just one. The clothing and accessories are also affordable, and can be found at stores in your nearby mall. 

SEVENTEEN isn't all fashion. It's really all about embracing who you are and making the most of life. It's about feeling good about yourself and loving yourself for who you are, and not what you aren't. I've used some of the tips on health, skin care, feeling good, and make-up, and you know what? They do work, and are actually helpful (***gasp***). 

The celebrity interviews are very good, and such that you can relate to them. The stories about things in teens' lives are also very good- some are sad, but they all make you aware of what really goes on out there.

It's a wonderful magazine. It doesn't have an overload of ads like Teen Vogue or Elle Girl, while still including fashion (though I will say not as much as these two mags, because these two are almost entirely all how to look good). SEVENTEEN however, has a bit more fashion than Teen People, Teen People having more stories and such (though it is right up there with SEVENTEEN). SEVENTEEN is a happy medium. It's an awesome magazine

Relevant Magazine has great articles for people who are in to culture and faith.  Many of the reviews are of secular artists, the spiritual content or message (or lack thereof) of the music they sing, films they make and books they write.  They also review Christian artists, many who are on the fringe.  This is a great magazine for those who are interested in these things.  If you just want a 'youth-oriented' Christian magazine with Bible studies and how-to's you'll probably be disapointed

This is not my favorite fitness magazine.  This is the size of a Reader's Digest, but is packed with ads just like a Beauty Magazine.  I find this a bit disappointing considering the breadth of information they tend to cover.  They share reasonable and attainable goals, and suggestions for us normal people.  The magazine seems to cover a wide age group, with information that is good for both young and old.  They do offer recipes, workout suggestions, and much more.  The magazine takes little time to read, and seems to only serve as a springboard for more follow up on topics you enjoy.  I think this is a better magazine to browse through at the supermarket than to purchase

I just received my first order, and I love it!  This magazine covers a broad range of topics and includes designer techniques, current trends, period styles and so much more.  It has tons of vibrant pictures to illustrate the articles.  I think this magazine would be ideal for someone just starting out in design to gain a basic understanding on a wide range of topics, and also for the experienced designer to keep up with current trends and fill in the gaps with knowledgeable tidbits

As a potential interior designer, I find that this magazine is both realistic and elegant in the articles it provides for the professional and for the hobbiest.  I have a subscription and I find that studying the designers, the styles and the themes I have learned so much about the work of a designer.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys color, fabrics or just pictures of beautifully designed rooms and interiors

Paula's magazine is wonderful...unlike what one of the reviewers wrote about the recipes being bland. They are all from Paula's cookbooks, new recipes or from her friends.  NONE are bland...they are Pure Paula and all have the wonderful southern flare she is known for.  I have been fortunate enough to meet Paula in person and was at a recent taping of her new t.v. show Paula's Party...this magazine is just another wonderful extention of her many talents!

I like Paula Deen's cooking, and find that I prefer to order my magazines through Amazon because they send me an email update when my subscription is really about to expire, so I can choose to renew, instead of flooding me with 6 months' worth of letters in the mail saying "RENEW NOW" or else, you'll miss an issue. Invariably, I never missed an issue, but I certainly OVERpaid too soon by sending in subscription cards and renewing too early when I may not have wanted to.

This magazine is great!!!  The Weddings magazine is for the bride who wants great ideas and advice for a stylish and elegant wedding. The magazine includes great articles for wedding tips, sanity savers and after the wedding advice.  Weddings does contain advertisements for attire, BUT that is not their only service.  This magazine also includes wonderful "real wedding" stories that are inspiring and give great ideas for your own wedding. I highly recommend this magazine for a more mature bride, or for a bride who already has picked out her dress but still wants great wedding ideas

I absolutely love this magazine!  It is a wonderful motivation for anyone who wants to be healthy and strong.  I will be 38 in a few weeks, and am considering competing in a fitness competition because of this magazine.  I read it from beginning to end, and my husband even reads it.  He always asks if I saw the article on this or that, which is an indication that the information presented is useful and engaging.  If you are serious about your health, want to get in shape or want to take your body to the next level, this is the magazine for you

I love this magazine and I look forward to getting it in the mail every single week, unless if the last one was a double issue. Then I have to wait another whole week, which can sometimes be painful. I love the reviews and the magazine is funny, fresh and it keeps me up to date on movies, TV, music, and DVDs. The onlt complaint I have is lately they don't have as many reviews for urban releases

I picked up a copy of Health at my local grocery store, mostly out of curiosity. I found myself enjoying it enough so that I will be ordering a subscription. Here's why:
1.It encompasses every facet of health, not just diet or exercise. As one reviewer noted, it is broken down into categories: Looks, Living, Moving, Feeling, and Flavor (it was just redone). The articles in each seem to be well-written and are enjoyable. I particularly enjoy the Feeling and Living sections, as they are something that is rarely found in other magazines.
2. Unlike many other magazines, I found myself marking or wanting to mark so many pages to keep or check out further that in ended up being a good part of the magazine. I, like most others, enjoy getting the most for my money.
While everyone has a different idea of what constitutes a "good" magazine, this one will soon be a regular fixture in our house

I have been reading Health off and on since I was in high school in the late 1980s, and overall I love this magazine!  The articles are usually rather interesting, and there is always at least one long article that I find relevant to my life or curiosities.

However, there are times when the topics/articles border on resembling Cosmo and Glamour rather than really being related to health.

Overall, I recommend Health as a great read for entertainment purposes and a great reference for health-related issues, but don't always expect nobel prize winning research data in every article

This is a pretty good magazine. The niche is that it goes out every week and thus it is the most current business news magazine out there (if you compare it to Fortune, Forbes...). I always find 3-4 interesting articles there, but don't expect to read cover to cover

I've been a BW subscriber for 8 years now, and if the magazine stays as good as it currently is, I see at least 60 more years of subscription.

BW is a very well balanced magazine focusing mainly on business trends and headline news.  A majority of their articles are extremely informative, well written, and objective.  If there is an opinion piece, it is clearly stated as "Commentary".  I enjoy the "Economic Viewpoint" where it alternates between right and left wing economists (Hubbard for Rep., Tyson for Dems).  BW is also forward thinking in writing about trend analysis and disecting what the future may bring.  There is a good snippet of International business.  

A couple weaknesses of the magazine:
-Tech & You column.  The guy writes about the same category of gadgets over and over again (mainly PDA & what not).  I would like to see more articles about HDTV, laptops, desktops, software, etc.  Tech & You appears to be written for either a road-warrior or a technophobe.
-Personal lifestyles section.  Seems like the magazine is catering towards a more upscale crowd, writing about exotic vacations and expensive wines that only either a very rich person or a very debt prone person could afford.

I also find the magazine to be weak in covering the retail sector.  I'd like to read more full articles about companies average consumers deal with on a weekly basis.  The Kmart/Sears deal was largely overshawdowed.

All in all, if I could only choose one magazine to receive, this would be the one.

I have subscribed to Business week for two years now.  I suggest that people accusing them of having a liberal agenda reread their past issues.  Bush was receiving criticism for not being Republican enough! His deficit spending is the most clear example.  Other fiscal conservatives, such as George Will, have criticized the President.  Does that mean they are following a liberal agenda? I think not

  Before I begin, there's one thing you need to know: I can't cook.

  I have skills that can't be beaten when it comes to heating stuff in the microwave, and I can use the toaster oven to, uh, toast things, but that's it. No whipping up any fancy 30-minute meals for me, which probably makes me the only person who can't cook who actually buys this magazine. 

This should say a great deal about just how entertaining EVERY DAY WITH RACHAEL RAY actually is.

  Of course, as you might expect, I like Rachael Ray. It REALLY would be weird for someone to buy this magazine if they didn't cook and they also hated Rachael, and I'm not THAT weird! However, although this is ostensibly a cooking-centric magazine, I'd argue that it really reflects Rachael's ATTITUDE and personality. Her enthusiasm, love of a wide variety of food, and adventurous spirit shine through on every page. By all reports, Rachael was very hands-on in developing this magazine, and it shows. 

  To those who ask why they need to read a Rachael Ray magazine, since Rachael is all over television these days (most recently with her own syndicated daytime talk show), chew on this: Rachael isn't taking over the world by accident. She's obviously doing something right to be dominating both the Food Network's daily schedule and the bestseller lists (for her ever-increasing line of cookbooks). People just can't get their fill of her! So, what exactly is her secret? I think it boils down to these factors: a combination of approachability and charisma, which are key ingredients of superstardom (think of talented-yet-friendly stars such as Tom Hanks or Shakira). Add to that a dash of optimism mixed with a spirit of adventure, as witnessed on my favorite Ray show, "$40 a Day," in which she explores a new tourist destination each week, trying to eat well on an insanely low budget.
 
  But what about Rachael Ray in magazine form, you're wondering? Well, in my opinion, EVERY DAY WITH RACHAEL RAY appeals to all tastes by brilliantly translating her unique appeal from the tv screen to the printed page. As I mentioned earlier, I probably won't be cooking anything from the many recipes included in each issue, but I still like checking them out. Each recipe includes a picture of the finished product, and the recipes have lots of variety and creativity... Yum-o! And some are so simple, like sandwiches or salads, that I get the feeling I might actually be able to attempt them if I really wanted to (See? Rachael's "can-do" attitude even gets through to the kitchen-incompetent!)

   The travel articles and the short pieces (about a wide range of topics such as buying cheese, making mistakes in the kitchen, etc.) are also fun. But, as a Rachael fan, I especially enjoy the parts of the magazine written by, or about, Rachael. One nice feature is a Q & A in which readers can send in questions about Rachael which she personally answers. As someone who has participated in a lot of "celebrity Q & A's" online in the past, I love these chances to get to know more about someone famous who you may never meet in person. In fact, the only reason I haven't rated EVERY DAY WITH RACHAEL RAY "five stars" is because I'd like to see even more Rachael-related photos and articles in each issue... how cool would that be?! Also, I'm hungry for more interactivity: perhaps some food-themed Sudoku, or some search-a-words. But to be fair, this is a relatively new magazine, and all great magazines need time to  sort out what does and doesn't work. And so far, EVERY DAY WITH RACHAEL RAY has hit the ground running and is off to a great start. 

I was actually the first person to buy the very first issue at my local bookstore when it came out (I got lucky and happened to be there as they set up the display), and I've looked forward to each new issue ever since that day. If you like Rachael Ray, you can't go wrong here... start spending every day with Rachael Ray and "take a bite outta life." Even if you can't boil water!

If the text is about cooking a steak for example the pictures will be clear and easy to understand and will fully document what the text is saying. There are many many recipes. One section actually has a pull out shopping list and menus for a week. A great magazine. Well worth the money.

Excellent selection of recipes anyone can prepare, in just 30 minutes.  No need to be out of ideas for any party or get together, just open the book to any page, and you're set and ready to go, or should I say Cook!

Good Housekeeping is a wholesome, clean, serious magazine.  Various topics that may be found in an issue - how to raise children, household tips, financial help, or marriage advice - suggest that the magazine is geared towards the middle-aged to the older woman.  I'm married and only in my 20s, but I still get so much out of reading the articles and advice anyway.  

I absolutely love this magazine!  I was looking for a magazine with good, long articles to read, and I found this great one.  They even re-designed the look, and it's excellent.  Everything is more organized, clearly separated into their respective sections, and each page is clearly marked with the section header so I'll always know which section I'm on.

I particularly enjoy the articles about real-life triumphs and tragedies, Talk to Me by Joy Behar about relationship advice, and Peggy Post's Etiquette Dilemmas

I remember when this magazine was the lone Conservative voice on the newstands. I too have memories of many long Latinate sentences which Mr.Buckley provided and I had to try and figure out. 
It is not that I always agreed, much less understood him. But I did feel that he was a man walking to the sound of his own drummer, who had a real concern for public life in America, and his own ideas of how to make it better.
I also saw through the years that he edited a very intelligent opinion- journal which explored many aspects of American reality.
The magazine today seems to me still to be of high- quality, though Mr. Buckley is no longer at the helm.

The magazine is being delivered as per the agreement.  Some people especially the avowed liberals would not want this magazine as this presents a strong conservative viewpoint.

What a beautiful magazine (full color pictures on glossy paper), and what interesting stories behind each food.  The recipes are sometimes doable, although most of the time I just like to read about the exotic ingredients in each.

A must have- makes the living room look very sophisticated

In Christmas of 2005 I decided I wanted the most interesting and best cooking magazines out there. But which ones to pick? After buying one here and there I found three that I absolutely love.

Saveur was one. The recipes are nice though some I wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole (ethnic ingredients that don't appeal to me). But the stories and the pictures... they aren't just amazing, they're astounding! Where National Geographic talks about certain things or places, Saveur takes you to different places and shows you what's there and how they eat. 

They showed me Ireland and I even made Colcannon (a mashed potato and cabbage dish) everyone loved it. I made a french dish last night that was amazing. It was a little time consuming but worth it!

I do have admit I was a little disappointed with my first issue I received from them with my subscription. It looked like a dog ate it then ran through the water with it. It's readable but I wasn't happy. They also promise two exclusive magazines for new subscribers. I've never seen them. But I have been getting my magazines and they look good. 

I was thinking about it the other night, my three magazines I picked... one was articles and recipes about healthy eating (Eating Well), one was easier recipes with no articles (Everyday Food), and then Saveur. If I could only pick one to keep... it would be Saveur. It's really that good of a read.

This is simply a beautiful magazine, printed on heavy, glossy paper. Its pages contain many beautiful photographs of different foods, wines, and the countries from which they originate. It is not only a food and wine magazine with wonderful recipes that are easy to follow, it is also a travel guide of sorts with a great deal of information on other countries, their food and wine, their  restaurants, and their culture. Usually included are some fascinating historical details of how a custom associated with a particular food may have come about. The articles are invariably well-written and offer a wealth of fascinating information.  

I am a tea lover, and I love going to afternoon tea with its repast of scones, dainty sandwiches, and light cakes. So, I particularly enjoyed an article that the magazine recently had that focused on tea. It transported the reader to Devon, England with its afternoon tradition of  tea and scones, accompanied by clotted cream and  jam, which is often referred to as a cream tea. Of course, a beautiful bone china tea pot and bone china cups are essential to the having of a proper cup of tea. This, too, is discussed in the article. Photographs of an authentic village tearoom in Devon were included, as well as recipes for making scones, tea sandwiches, black currant jam, strawberry jam, and Victoria Sponge Cake.   

The article went on to discuss how clotted cream is made. It interspersed the discussion with personal anecdotes from those who make clotted cream. A guide was included for Devon in terms of where to stay, where to eat, and where to go for tea. The article went on to discuss the differences among the various available tea experiences, detailing what constitutes an afternoon tea, a cream tea, and a high tea, and giving some of the historical underpinnings of each.  I so enjoyed this article! Even if I never physically go to Devon, I feel as if the magazine had transported me there, as it was vividly drawn by so expert and sure a hand. The magazine has these types of articles in every issue, covering regions from all over the world, including those in the United States.  

The magazine also contains a helpful section titled, "The Pantry", which is a guide to resources that have to do with food products and kitchenware related to articles in the current issue of the magazine. This makes it invariably easier for the reader, who may wish try some of the more esoteric recipes, to find what one needs. It is little wonder that I love this magazine. Those who are interested in wonderful food, excellent and easy to follow recipes, other cultures and customs, as well as traveling, will simple adore this magazine. It makes a wonderful gift. I know, because this magazine was a gift to me and one for which I am grateful, as it is a gift that one gets to enjoy again and again, each and every month.

I subscribe to all of the home and garden magazines and Southern Accents is the best, bar none.  The houses featured are absolutely dreamy--the photography is gorgeous--and while the magazine doesn't offer how-to decorating ideas, there is so much inspiration.  I find it to be intelligently written...which is rare in a decorating magazine. The articles on antiques are particularly informative.  This magazine will appeal to anyone who is interested in beautiful, classic design--whether or not you live in the South

Not Only Black + White is a great Australian magazine, and of top quality.  I used to buy it in bookstores here in New Zealand, but they don't seem to be available here anymore.  I am not subscribing to it, but I'd keep getting them if they were available in bookshops where I live.  I emailed the publisher twice about this, but I didn't get any response.  Aside from that, this is a great mag (yes, it has fine art nude pictorials as well as lots more) and one that you would hang on to like a "coffee table" book rather than treat like a typical magazine.  It has a thicker cover and pages than normal magazines too.  For a magazine, you could almost rate it a 5, but nothing beats a proper book (no advertising, etc), so I rate this a 4.  Aside from the photography, it also makes a good reference for page layout and typographical ideas as well, for anyone into desktop publishing

After been loaned this issue of June 2004, by a committed, really
genuine Episcopalian, I was greatly impressed! These creative, unique articles captured my Imagination: "What is Power?" by Sam Keen; "Taking the First Step" by Anna Lappe`; "Accessing Sacred Energy," by Judith Orloff, MD; "The Making of a Chaplain" By Karen O'Brien (So like the pages of my earlier Verbatim in CPE).
 
"The Best Spiritual Books" are reviews of 50 out of 300 books by Fred and Mary Ann Brussat! We surely agreed on the first few named: "The Heart of Christianity" Marcus Borg; "Beyond Belief" Elaine Pagels; "The Wisdom Way of Knowing" Cynthia Bourgeault; ++
"The Lord is My Shepherd" Rabbi Kushner+ "The Power of Patience" by M J Ryan!  

I am still in the whirlwind of those emotionally stimulating, artistically written articles on varied yet potent topics of food for Thought and Reflection. Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood

I picked up a copy of Spirituality & Health a couple of years ago at a bookstore and sent in the subscription card right away.  This magazine is wonderful if you're looking for a magazine devoted to putting a spiritual perspective on life.  This magazine covers everything; mind, body, and spirit, the total package.  In the back there are also listings of upcoming events that the spiritually inclined may be interested in.  I highly recommend this magazine, as I always catch myself saying to someone, "I just read this awesome article in Spirituality & Health...

Too many Christians are ignorant of our rich past.  We know a lot about the 1st Century and the current times, but everything in between is somewhat blank.  Christian History magazine is more than informative; it inspires, challenges and even admonishes in its unique way.  I look forward to each issue.  I doubt I will ever let this expire

"The Writer" is the premier magazine for writers of all varieties. Kalmbach is known for publishing a great series of specialty periodicals, and this one is extremely well written and edited, as is appropriate for the subject matter.

The magazine is best for aspiring writers of fiction, with the clear majority of column inches. Poetry is also covered well, and nonfiction (my area of interest), while covered, is definitely in third place. In the end, though, most techniques for fiction also help nonfiction authors and vice-versa: I read every issue cover to cover regardless of area of concentration because I have gleaned some of the best tips from articles that superficially seemed not to pertain to my writing. 

The magazine is very good at covering new developments in the publishing world, and features in-depth reporting on subjects like "Print on Demand" (POD) publishing. Many articles concentrate on in-depth technique implementation, while the utilitarian short pieces that cut through grammatical tedium and stylistic methodologies reinforce the basics. 

If you are interested in writing as a professional or just for personal satisfaction, "The Writer" is the magazine for you.

This is simply the best woman's magazine I've ever read!  And I can say that I've read a lot of them - both in the US and in Germany.  
I've read it for over 12 years and I can say that I never got bored with it.  I'm still excited about any new issue.  The articles always matter and they catch just the right balance between being serious and entertaining.  It's for the modern young woman.  To name a few subjects:  Career, love, sex, family, style&fashion, wellness&beauty, travel reports and interviews - every article going a bit deeper than the usual woman's magazine.  There's really something to read for days.  And on a side not: There's more articles than ads!

I know it takes eight weeks and maybe longer but I do appreciate the information that I've gained from store bought "Maximum PC" magazines.  I don't build computers but when I do order one, it is nice to be familier with the workings and attributes of the new computer.
Yes... you can find much information on-line and generally faster than the amount of time it takes for the magazine to reach your mailbox, however, is great to kick back away from the computer in your favorite chair and 'read' about it :)
A very good magazine... but 'adult' language used at times does not appear to me as professional use of the english language.
Thus the 4 rather than five stars

While many mainstream publications have been shying away from calling members of the current American government into account for their transgressions - from bribery and theft to misinformation and cover-ups of sexual escapades - "The Nation" has done its job and reported the facts.  For its trouble, many of those who lean the same way as the current administration lambast the magazine as "too liberal" and "naively progressive."

So let's put it this way: If you value truth over lies and think the rights of "the little guy" are just as important as the rights of fat cats, you will like "The Nation."  But be warned -- "The Nation" is rife with page after thorough page of intense reporters' writings, and even some clever poetry, but only rarely has pictures.  Which may be the real reason why right wingers don't like it

I read the Nation for its poetry, Katha Pollitt and takes on the news.  It's a left wing magazine.  I don't understand the people who criticize it for being liberal and expect "objectivity". Humans have opinions and viewpoints. Even Time magazine and the National Review have viewpoints.

The author of the Declaration of Independence and promoter of a bill of rights for the U.S. Constitution, Thomas Jefferson once wrote: "I read no newspaper now but Ritchie's, and in that chiefly the advertisements, for they contain the only truths to be relied on in a newspaper." [Letter to Nathaniel Macon, January 12, 1819]

The Nation is not a newspaper. Rather it is a weekly compilation of informed opinion and investigative reportage that reports what the main stream press and infotainment TV doesn't dare to. Those Americans whose minds have been addled by a steady stream of ideological propaganda and lies call The Nation "left wing," "liberal," "radical," etc., etc. 

Plato had written 2,300 years ago his Allegory of the Cave: "Behold! human beings living in an underground den, which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching all along the den; here they have been from their childhood, and have their legs and necks chained so that they cannot move, and can only see before them, being prevented by the chains from turning round their heads." Plato's "punchline" was "...  And if he is compelled to look straight at the light, will he not have a pain in his eyes which will make him turn away to take refuge in the objects of vision which he can see, and which he will conceive to be in reality clearer than the things which are now being shown to him?"

And so, dear reader The Nation is filled with sunlight that too many Americans cannot stand to look into directly. It is much less painful for them simply to say: "... the Nation's political bias is so far to the Left that it repeatedly errors in its evaluations of the American and world - situation."

For those who wish to know the simple truth of what is going on in America and the world read The Nation. It prints the patriotic, incisive truth.

InStyle is my favorite fashion magazine out there.  It is much more reader-friendly than Vogue - much cleaner layout, the font is easier to read, and the writing is clear, witty, and less dry.  I've been reading InStyle for about 3 years, and each issue never disappoints me.  

The focus of the magazine is definitely fashion, but there are also makeup tips and celebrity news. The magazine targets a much broader audience than more haute couture magazines like Vogue.  My favorite section is "The Look" which highlights celebrity fashion and also has a section at the end that profiles a specific designer or label. 

InStyle also features many tips and recommendations on beauty products.  The best issue of the year is without a doubt in March or April when they do "Best Beauty Buys."  After polling beauty experts and testing hundreds of products, they feature the best beauty products in ever imaginable category.  I've discovered some of my favorite beauty products through these issues, and it's nice to be able to trust a source without wasting your money on testing out expensive products that don't work for you.  It is the best source for getting the most reliable products out there, from hair care products to makeup.  I have seen several women at Sephora, clutching torn out pages from InStyle's Best Beauty Buys and frantically searching for the right mascara.  

I understand that Vogue is an institution now, but InStyle offers a much better alternative, and provides articles that you actually want to read and tips you actually use.

I love InStyle.  I can easily spend an entire afternoon with each and every issue of InStyle.  It is packed with the latest fashion trends and classic, timeless fashion.  It shows what is hot, how to put outfits together, who wears what, and it doesn't try to dabble in other areas.  It sticks to fashion and I like that.  That is why I subscribe to it and probably always will.  The best out there.  MUCH better than Elle and likely even better than Vogue.  I love it

I'm a culinary historian and author (CALIFORNIA PIONEERS, their stories, culture and cuisine)who spends a lot of time delving into the pages of history, especially food history. When I want to give my burned-out peepers a break, I reach for this magazine.

As much as I love the food articles -- mostly because, as great as they look, realistically they are quite do-able for just about anyone -- what I really find useful is the "Ask Martha" column in which practical answers are given to problems readers write in about.

And then there are the craft projects...I have tried several and was surprised by my success. I credit this to the well laid-out photos and very clear instructions. 

My advice is, if you are looking for a magazine that touches on every aspect of living and enjoying a well-designed (and I do not mean "haughty") lifetsyle, then you cannot go wrong with Martha Stewart Living.

Also, the special holiday ideas are the best ever...makes one wonder, how do they keep coming up with such unique ideas that are do-able for the general population?[...

This magazine transports you to a different world.  Every issue is a wish-book, with holiday cooking to plan over the upcoming month, or crafts to do over your next long weekend, or a bookcase to try to paint for a new room.  Well, in my life, years go by and I dream on.  But just leafing through this magazine erases so many cramped, negative, angry thoughts.  I will never laugh at "crafty" people again.  I will also probably never actually accomplish anything so beautifully pictured inside, but the dreams are sweet.  

The expert information regarding vintage items and preservation alone is fascinating, but then you have gardening, cooking, baking, furniture, decorating, beading, anything do-it-yourself.  Martha is truly a wonder woman.  Worth every cent

Someone posted below that they don't receive all their issues.  I have never failed to receive an issue.  I suspect someone is making off with this person's copies.

This is an elegant magazine, worthy of Martha.  If they cover a topic, you will know all there is to know about that topic.  The recipes are little gems, and I like the pullout recipe cards so they can be easily saved.

It's a little oasis of calm in a frentic world.

I do miss Martha's column of reminiscences, and wish that was back in the magazine

The American Spectator is a must read for anyone considering themselves an intellectual. Not only are the articles witty and well-researched, they also provide well-articulated arguments to the most pressing (if sometimes slighlty out of date) controversies of the times. Well worth the subscription price, or even the cover price

"The Economist" is a great weekly magazine with in-depth, balanced and enlightening journalism. The articles are largely expertly written by knowledgeable people.

The writing in "The Economist" is interesting and insightful with articles conveying detailed and yet condensed information. The magazine has contributions from senior people from all over the world, making it interesting and relevant to a worldwide readership.

The editors and journalists of the Economist need to be applauded for the broad range of well-written articles with balanced analysis every week. Reading this magazine ensures that I know what is happening worldwide every week, although I do not always agree with some positions the magazine takes.

This is recommended reading for business leaders and decision makers who require a diverse range of views and information about what is happening at different places in the world on subjects as diverse as politics, current affairs, science and technology, national, regional and global issues, finance, trade, and development. Even Great People like Nelson Mandela relied on this magazine for news during his long years in prison.

This is the most accurate geo-political and socio-economic English-language news-weekly there is. Period. Articles are succinct, top-notch, and cover everything from the world today to business, economics to the environment. I do think the magazine tends to focus a bit too little on the environment and religion, but that is my perception. Despite the editorial style and very sophisticated diction, articles are still easy to understand. True, this magazine (or newspaper, as it calls itself) is staunchly pro-democracy (i.e. broadly speaking, anti-Russian policy, anti-Chinese policy in their respective conflicts, say, over Georgia or Taiwan, and pro-war on the Iraq issue), pro-free trade, and pro-European (i.e. for the expansion of the EU). But it takes many conservative and liberatarian positions, too, and oftentimes even liberal ones, which, overall, makes the magazine fairly objective - you'll usually get all or most of the points-of-view after reading just a few articles on the same subject, although the Economist usually does imply, or sometimes downright state, which position it takes or the world must take. Actually that's the best part: it is very refreshing to have a magazine that is not afraid to share its opinion and offer its advice to readers, hence its influence. This, for me, is the icing on the cake.

As an economics and international relations student, I have been receiving The Economist for some three years already. In that short time span, it has been a source -- usually the main source -- of dozens of my essays and country reports (the country or topical surveys published every several weeks are excellent for this!) and reading the magazine has increased my English vocabulary significantly. I finally feel that my vocabulary has increased from third-grade level to college-level.

Yes, it does indeed take a few weeks to get used to the unique writing style, but the magazine is indispensible. To some it may appear arrogant, which is what I tend to sense at times, but that does not mean it is a bad magazine. Quite simply, it tends to think of itself as sophisticated, and rightfully so. While half-owned by the Financial Times, many of The Economist's authors also write for the latter, which can help explain while the two are similar. But while the Financial Times is a daily newspaper with fairly brief articles and a 50-50 slant on news and finance/business, the economist's articles, while also succinct, focus on everything in the world that impacts people. And that is why it's an excellent summary of the world this week for those people with little time on their hands.

Finally, I do not necessarily sense an anti-Semitic slant as stated in one previous review. Yes, I am Jewish, but I tend to regard The Economist's proposed solutions -- such as dealing with Hamas politically (despite their "militancy"), as they cannot be destroyed -- to of the Middle East conflict as mere pragmatism at work. The same with its proposal to legalize various drugs. Not that both of these things will ever happen in today's world (the Mid-East conflict won't end; drugs won't be decriminalized in most countries), but the thinking is purely pragmatic, which is refreshing for a world so increasingly bent on political correctness. In this respect, as in the aforementioned ones, I feel the magazine is a lot more objective overall than many others, despite the specific positions it takes in particular articles. It makes for a truly fascinating read.

It is most surely the investment it claims to be, so for any of those with any remaining doubts, the $129 subscription price ($77 for students) is more than worth it. Just read three or four issues and you'll see. Trust me

The Economist has to be the best weekly magazine for current events.  Whether you are conservative or liberal you will appreciate the well thought out and reasoned essays that this magazine has to offer.  I don't think this will end up swaying people's political opinions too much but it will at least provide an informed opinion.  Americans know too little about the world around them and this is the perfect tool for fixing that.

There are arguments that this magazine swings on both sides of the political fence depending on your views.  I have my opinions on this but still love it.  The articles I disagree with force me to think and hone my own debates.  To compare this magazine with Newsweek or Time is like comparing a precision automobile with one of those 25 cent rides kids enjoy.  Sure they make the motions of a car, and look like a car but in the end they don't go anywhere and you wasted your money with nothing to show for it.  This magazine does more with its short essays than Newsweek could ever do with its six-page layouts.

Too bad there isn't a "teen" version of this magazine.  That would do a lot to rectify America's education problems.

I find the argument that some people cite that this magazine has a severe pro-laissez faire bias is ridiculous at best.  It is like criticizing Auto magazines for having a combustion engine bias.  This is a magazine of economics.  Since laissez faire economics is the basis for just about every single economy in the world, they concentrate on it.  Sorry but Marxist and Keynesian economic models didn't pan out.  Maybe if feudilism mounts a come back they might change their focus, until then we are stuck with reality.

Most newsmagazines are dumbed down in both intellectual rigor and political bite.  This is the only weekly newsmag I can stand to read, and I love to read it.  US news is a grab bag of topics, international is excellent (vs. other US sources of news), finance & business is excellent, science is a grab bag, books & arts is quite good, and the periodic special reports are great.  Cheeky and clear, a delight to read.  Bring your skepticism, though, because the reporters & columnists are not shy about taking a position, and you have to be ready to grapple and form your own opinion.

Too often in America we are fed news by deceiving journalists (such as those that work for Fox News). The Economist offers news with an agenda that does not always correspond to America's. It is a great resource for furthering ones knowledge of the world, from politics to economics to science to the arts. Best of all, the articles (except for the Special Report) are concise, allowing for an easy read.

This magazine has great recipies!  Most of them are incredibly easy, but there are a few "adventuresome" ones every once in a while to try when you feel up to a challenge.  Sometimes the recipies need a few more spices, so I usually add more than they say (heck, it doesn't change the calorie count). However, Cooking Light does not trade calories for taste, so the whole family likes the meal and there are MANY recipies that I would proudly serve to company (the majority, in fact). There are also just a TON of recipies per issue.  The only negative things I would say is that a few of the recipies are only marginally "healthy" and sometimes there's some redundancy.  Overall, it's a GREAT buy

Yes - there are tons of great shots in the mag; great articles ( in French only ) , contests---very chic....HOWEVER---- customer service will treat you like the redheaded stepchild when you ask them " WHY HAVE YOU NOT SENT ME THE LATEST ISSUE OF PHOTO?? "....and you know it WILL HAPPEN. They only send you sporadic issues when THEY feel like it ( or so it would seem )... Most issues are available on the stand WEEKS before you get yours delivered via mail ( should it be the other way around??? ) And they wont give you a courtesy letter/postcard telling you when your subscription is up...that's for you to figure out. SO if you can deal with the lame french hold music when you call Photo's Cutomers Service CONSTANTLY, this is a great magazine..... cough...cough...vive la France!

There was a time when I read a lot of magazines.  I found there being too much fluff and not enough stuff.

I was introduced to Fast Company in 1997, and have been a subsriber for most if not all of the last 8 years.  Every issue has relevant topics on the current state of business.  It has stayed with a formula that has worked; that business in constantly changing, and to reflect back on the past when something has changed that they once wrote on.

I heartily recommend this must read to anyone who wants to make a difference in the business world

New and improved: 'The' Gramophone.

Effective with the November, 2004 issue, Gramophone has undergone a number of changes in design and editorial content, all for the better. One of these changes, perhaps the most minor of all, is the reversion to its original title, 'The' Gramophone. The other changes are more substantial, hardly cosmetic, especially for North American readers.

One of the more notable new features is an article devoted to "The Event" (great musical events in history). For my money, Gramophone could hardly have done better than to feature the September 12, 1910 premire performance of Gustav Mahler's 8th Symphony ("The Symphony of A Thousand," according to Emil Guttmann, the promoter engaged by Mahler for the premire). If I had just *one* performance to pick, were I able to turn the clock back, it would unquestionably have been this one. The anonymous writer has done a competent and reasonably accurate and complete job recapturing the excitement of an event which was talked about for decades afterward by those who were there.

Another new feature is titled "The Experts' Expert," in which well-known musicians of today talk about their own historical favorites for their instrument(s). For the November, 2004 issue, several famous violinists (plus Lara St. John, who falls into a different category entirely) praise their personal heroes. While not unanimous, it is telling that Anne-Sophie Mutter, Sarah Chang, Julia Fischer and two others identify David Oistrakh as their personal inspiration.

Still a third new feature, "Gramophone Classics," is a roundtable discussion of historic performances (one each month) by the Gramophone reviewers. For this kick-off month, the historic performance is that of the complete cycle of Dvorak symphonies by the late Istvn Kertsz and the London Symphony Orchestra. Now nearly forty years old, this is a boxed set of the cycle that I had favorably reviewed myself, quite some time back. (Interestingly, a nice photograph of Kertsz conducting the LSO shows that [at least] the principal flutist was playing a wooden flute, an advantage usually conceded to Czech musicians over their counterparts elsewhere in performing Dvorak's symphonies.)

The balance of Gramophone, aside from minor cosmetic layout changes, is pretty much as it had been in recent years. There is the usual North American supplement/insert, covering events, performers and releases specific to this market; this is the version American subscribers receive and which is available in American book and magazine stores. The monthly reviews section is always of interest because it includes reviews of releases often available in the U.K. (and the continent) before they are available domestically. There is the obligatory "free" CD that includes excerpts from the Editors' Choice of Best Discs of the Month (something which I tend to ignore, if only because excerpts can only give an incomplete picture of matters). And, finally, always of interest to this semi-gearhead are the audio equipment reviews, if only to point out the differences between American and British gearheads. :-)

The main purpose of such a publication is, of course, to provide critical commentary on new classical music releases. In this respect, I find the U.S.-published Fanfare to be a more reliable source of information than the U.K.-published Gramophone. Chalk it up to "across the pond" differences in both repertoire and opinion, if you like. Nevertheless, the improvements that take us from "Gramophone" to "The Gramophone" are enough for me to bump what might have been a 3-star review to one that is a solid 4 stars.

I don't know what planet that guy is from who is saying below that he had to wait a long time, if he bought a pair of glasses he would notice that you have to wait for 12-16 weeks for every magazine you order from Amazon. I had no problem with that-- I think the Strand is a unique magazine. With fiction by such great writers as Sir John Mortimer, Edward Marston, and great interview with actor Michael York. They also have fine articles one such article was about Hercule Poirot & Agatha Christie. They are doing a great job

I find the Woman's Day magazine a helpful source of information for myself, my family and my friends.  As I go through the articles and information in the magazine, I note items of interest for my husband and I (we are retired seniors), and for my daughter who has two children.  Since the news that my son and his wife are expecting, I also save information for them.  I have tried some of the recipes and were very pleased.  Thank you for putting out such a great magazine

From parenting advice, health, cooking, crafts and homemaking and more, it bonds its target audience together whether you're a single mom, happily married, or even single. I enjoyed this magazine as a teen with my mom and love it even more as an adult. Highly recommend

Woman's Day is a good resource for women. It covers a variety of topics, including health/beauty, diet/exercise, relationships, children. There are tips for getting organized, recipes, crafts and decorating tips also. There's a Tip A Day Calendar as well as a Day to Day meal planner. It relies heavily on reader's tips which are scattered through the magazine and in the various articles.  Each issue tells you how to join the Woman's Day Readers panel to submit tips and maybe win a prize. And even if you don't want to join the Reader's panel, there are plenty of other prizes given away by Woman's Day.

Woman's Day is well worth subscribing to!

A real favorite in this magazine is the page of quotes, It is sure to bring a smile or teach you something about life. They also always have cleaning tips, health topics, diet and exercise solutions, true stories, beauty hints, inspirational articles, soul nourishing tips, recipes, recipes and more recipes, family/children, flowers, end of the magazine article to make you think about life, and gardening hints. 

If you want to find a cover story fast, they have an "on our cover" section in the index. In Every Issue there is a shopper's guide and a recipe index. 

The articles are helpful and in the March 2002 issue they had an article on how to be less stressed. They also had an article on PCOS which is apparently more common than we women think. 

The beauty sections show you the newest fashion and you can decide if you want to adapt your style to the trends. Always seems rather chic. 

Some of the recipes in the March 2002 issue included:

A luscious Lemon Coconut Pound Cake
Coconut Macaroons
Peanut Butter Oat Bars
Baby Cheesecakes - really cute 
Banana Salsa
French Oven Beef Stew
Pasta with Shrimp

The recipes are not difficult and seem practical. 

Even the advertising in this magazine is colorful and fun. 

A Very "American Gal" type magazine. 
Nothing fancy, just real life.

This magazine is devoted to American inventions and technology that have affected our lives.  In essence, this magazine is a historical magazine about American technology.  Within each issue are multiple articles about a historical invention.  The articles can either focus on the technology or focus on an individual who has been a key contributor to the advancement of that technology.  Typically, each issue also has an interview with an inventor or inventors whose contributions have materially affected our lives or society.  

The scope of the magazine is broad.  There have been articles on the Trans-Canada highway.  Another recent issue had an excellent article on tunnel boring machines.  In yet another article the development of refinery cracking was described in the context of the development of higher performance engines.  The contribution of high octane gasoline to the winning of the air war was mentioned, an interesting piece of trivia of which I was previously unaware.

The scope of the magazine is beyond the physical sciences.  Biology and the development of medical technology are also covered.  While the magazine is written at a level that an educated non-expert can understand, some of the biology related articles challenge my attention.

This magazine is an excellent source of technological history.  However, while the technical jargon used is that appropriate to a technology, this magazine is not light reading for those unfamiliar with a specific field.  As an example, I had to read portions of the article on refinery cracking a couple of times to understand the general description of how the cracking process works.  Therefore, while I highly recommend this magazine to anyone with an interest in the history of technology, realize that for some readers, for example elementary school students, this magazine could present a reading challenge.

Most articles also provide pictures or other artwork.  Frequently this artwork is unavailable from any other magazine source because there are so few magazines that deal with technological history.  The quality of the images varies because many of the pictures have not been well-preserved, but in many cases they are the only pictures available.

This magazine frequently mentions the Inventor's Hall of Fame in Akron, Ohio, which is sponsored by the United States Patent & Trademark Office.  A number of articles have covered inductees to the Inventor's Hall of Fame, showing that while the articles are historical in nature, they are also currently relevant.

There are a large number of magazines that are either about technology, or have had articles about technology.  There are a large number of trade magazines that cover technology.  Sometimes these magazines even have articles about the history of an invention.  However, the "American Heritage of Invention & Technology" is the only magazine of which I am aware the covers the history of invention and technology.  While the focus of the articles is American technology, it is inevitable that the relationship of foreign invention is covered occasionally as well when that technology was important in the development of American technology.  I consider this magazine to be excellent for anyone with an interest in historical technology, and is an excellent complement to other historical magazines.

I wish this magazine came out more often (as another reviewer said).  It would be fascinating for anyone with the slightest interest in the history of technology and engineering.  Recent articles have covered vacuum tubes, their history, and why some are still used now, and nuclear power and how that industry stalled in America.  I remember reading another article in the mid-'90s about a guy in New York City who shoveled coal for a public school furnace.  He explained his job and how hard it was to buy a coal shovel (the hardware store people couldn't believe it).  A few years later they followed up with a note that all public schools in NYC had been converted from coal, and that the coal-shoveler's job was MUCH easier maintaining the new furnace.  Stories on iron bridges and how Necco wafers are made (with the same machine for 100 years or so) and how buttons are made from seashells and how paper clips are made and how a Hollywood actress designed a frequency-jumping weapons guidance system and all sorts of others are included.  Lots of cool articles about how everyday (and not-so-common) technologies went from ideas in someone's mind to products that are ready for use

First, I received this subscription as a gift for the holidays and can say that it is the gift that just gives, and gives, and gives.  This magazine has been a wonderful source of ideas for in the kitchen, on the grill, around the house, in my garden, in the state as well as all through the south for traveling.  Being a woman who moved from the Detroit suburbs to Florida so I could be with ailing family, I was really a duck out of my elements.  

I had no idea of what was where within the state; what are good places to visit, where are some of the great attractions outside of Orlando, the Keys, and the Everglades and who does what where.    In this magazine, there are sections devoted just to Florida (which I suspect they do for each state per subscription) -- what to plant when, what festivals are going on, what's hot and what's not - a whole derth of information devoted just to the state I live in.

And that's not all...

Not only do I get to learn more about where I am today, I can explore and learn about where I'd like to go tomorrow.  One month, it's "Welcome to Alabama" and all the wonderful gems it has to offer.  Another month, I am poring over beautiful Georgia.  A different topic?  Seafood of the South.  How would you like to learn about fantasic, but yet unknown, places for bargains and great finds?  

Now - I am also an avid cook at home - and I cannot tell you how much I love to read through and try/improvise on all the de-lish recipes found each month closer to the back of the magazine.  How many differnt ways have I learned to make potato salad alone is worth the cost of admission!  I have learned so much more about grilling, vegetable side dishes, breakfast treats and savories from all over the south, tempting, lip-smacking desserts - and everything in between.  I have always known the south was the jewel of the States when it came to cooking - but W.O.W!  So much history and fun can be shared whether it be in the kitchen or on the grill.  And it is a great compliment to what I learn from other books, the Food channel, and beyond.  It speaks to where I live, what I can get down here, and what the heck plantains are anyway :-)

I love looking through many of the decorating ideas, the travel tips, and vignettes of different states, or towns, or themes.  The only reason this magazine does not get a 5 from me is that it sometimes caters/addresses a crowd which can afford more than I can in the way of travel, decorating, etc.  I am more simple, down-to-earth folk, and do not share much with "decorating your summer cottage", or what to do with that spare $ thousand plus dollars on a cruise, or splurge excursion.  Sometimes, and since they are not making this magazine specifically for me I am not going to be able to relate to EVERYTHING, I am not the crowd they are talking to.  

Otherwise, this magazine is a 10 in my book  :-)  Well worth the money - but even more so - the anticipation of next month's "explorations"

This publication is, in my opinion, the most intelligent, funny, and readable magazine about PC games available. It blows the competition offered up by the U.S. magazines out of the water. 

You get:

*A dual-sided DVD loaded with demos, movies, screenshots, podcasts, games, mods, patches, and compiled archives of games and hardware recommendations to view from your PC

*Humor which obliterates the drivel attempted by the US version.

*Lots of material- it's thick and the pages are much bigger in size. You feel like you're getting a real magazine rather then a flimsy, cheap catalogue of advertisements. 

*Quality- both in the writing and physically. There are loads of articles with good insight into the industry every month. They are given lots of space and feel very scholarly to read. The pages are of good quality paper and the ink is crisp and clear, and is easy to read.

Pick up a copy of this from a shop like Barnes and Nobles sometime to see what it's like. I guarantee you'll be impressed, especially if you're used to the gaming fare we get served this side of the pond

No doubt, Wired is one of the best tech magazines in print, but the subscription for Wired for Amazon is apparently managed by a company called Synapse. I subscribed for a year's subscription in July and my first issue did NOT turn up even by mid November. I had to call and cancel my subscription. I now subscribe directly

The first copy of the magazine my wife received was a two month old copy of the magazine when the current magazine issue was on the newstand, the second issue came on time but the third issue has yet to arrive as the current issue has been sitting on the magazine shelf for weeks. The distribution of this very good product is very inconsistent.... maybe I can cancel my subscription and take a money lost and get this superior magazine from the magazine store

As an author I find Oprah's magazine to be the most inspirational any human being could use to start their month.  "Divorcing a wife because you can not be all she needs is a very loving act.  Everyone deserves intimacy-emotional and physical.  If a gay or bisexual man loves his wife, her happiness will be more important to him than his own.  Setting her free to allow her the opportunity to be loved as she deserves to be, is the ultimate expression of love." Dennis J. Schleicher

American PHOTO has an indepth look at alot of various subjects.  There are some photos of real life situations & experiences.  The latest issue depicted the Iraq war situation, how some of the soldiers & Iraqi civilians are coping with what's going on around them.
The magazine also has alot more close-up & detailed photo's, so even the amateur photographer can enjoy it.  I have been a subscriber to American PHOTO for many years & probably will continue to subscribe for as long as the magazine is in existence, or the rest of my life, whichever comes first.  I collect each & every issue.
I love America PHOTO!!!!

American Photo is a much better magazine than its sibling Popular Photography, but frankly, that is not saying much. It seems as though its primary market is fashion/glamour photographers since most of its issues are devoted to these aspects of professional photography. There are other magazines which excel at nature photography, so I am not disappointed by its absence here, but not noting more fine art documentary photograhy is a major omission which I hope this magazine does address eventually. There are also excellent photo equipment reviews frequently written by working professionals, as opposed solely to in-house technical equipment overviews. American Photo is without question among the better photo magazines currently available, but unless you are interested mainly in fashion and glamour photography, you might wish to look more closely at Shutterbug or other magazines devote to nature and fine art photography

VANITY FAIR is a highly recommended monthly magazine for people who enjoy reading.  Packed with lengthy articles, gorgeous photography and blurby information, it never fails to entertain the reader. It is the perfect companion for a lazy afternoon at the beach or on quiet plane ride across country.

The VANITY FAIR forumla is simple: slap a photo of a celebrity on the cover and inside offer a wide variety of articles, including Hollywood puff pieces, Domenick Dunne's true crime accounts, in-depth articles about international scandals, Christopher Hitchens essays and profiles of colorful, unknown characters.  

Though this formula has changed little since the magazine was revived in the 1980s by its now legendary editrix Tina Brown, the magazine's new editor, Canadian-born Graydon Carter, has succeeded in putting his own personal stamp on VANITY FAIR. In virtually every issue Carter uses his Letter from the Editor to bash US President Bush.  

Though I do not begrudge Carter his right to speak his mind, after months of reading Carter's criticism, I get bored with these relentless rants.

Still I highly recommend a VANITY FAIR subcription to anyone who enjoys reading.

I have read Vanity Fair for the past twenty years.  The articles are timely and in depth.  There are articles on politicians, bankers, CEOs as well as the Hollywood types.  This is the magazine for those who want to be in the know.  Also, the photographs are fantastic.  If you are looking for a two paragraph blurb about the actress/actor of the hour, this is not the magazine for you.

I have been reading this magazine and love it. Perfect for those of us who decorate in the shabby,cottage, romantic or new cottage style. There has recently been a change in editors or something like that and i see quite a difference in the magazine lately. Not too happy about it. It used to have great decorating ideas for the average person. Now their showing us castles etc. And pages of retailers with yarn shops,not to mention all the gardens. Pages wasted as far as i am concerned. A little was fine but pages and pages. I don't know if i will continue to buy, probably give it another month or 2 to see. Worth checking out to see if it is for you.

First, I've bought the magazine just about every months (for 6 months) but I liked it so much that I've decided to subscribe for it.
If you are into the shabby, cottage, romantic home decoration then you gonna love it!
I must tell you that the pictures are sooo inspirational, that when I put the magazine down I can't resist the urge to decorate and come up with great ideas! However these fabulous homes/shops futured in the magazine look very expensive, cost lots of bucks to put together! If you have planty of $$, then it's not a problem but the average person doesn't. So that's the time to get creative! I'd say get the decorator books out too, that will help! 
Personally I dont' pay too much attention for the articles since about 80% of the time the Shop/Home owners only talking about how much they like to live/work in their great romantic cottage environment, which designer helpd them to get the look or which part of Europe they flew to purchase that chandalier and so on...but not a word of advice about decorating!
The other 20% of the time you get designers, or other people talking about THE look, etc. that is useful. There's also a great list of websides at the back of the magazine where you can shop on line or at one of the first pages quite often a few beutiful object futured (sometimes it's even affordable)!
There are not too many adds here, like in other magazines that sometimes you can't find the end of the article..so that's a big + too!

People is the most incredible magazine.  The writers of the magazine know exactly what you want to read as a subscriber, but there will always be an extra section that just does not interest you because no magazine can attract every ones personal interests.  No matter what this magazine always makes Friday a great day.
	I feel the best part about People magazine is the fact that they give you special issues, like 50 Most Beautiful People, Sexiest Man Alive, and Eligible Bachelor.  You get a variety highlights in each People issue.
	You will find inside each issue many sections pertaining to your interest.  A section called the mailbox where you get to read other people responses to the articles in the last issue released.  The passage page where they will give you all the details of celebrities such as marriages, births, divorces, deaths, injured, or convicted.  Finally, I love getting toward the end of the magazine just to be able to read the true crime stories because they are intriguing and quite interesting.
	The only bad part about People magazine is that most people, just like myself, buy the issues to read about celebrities.  But you also get the human interest stories which 
don't seem to interest everyone.
	Now I do not have a subscription, but I read every issue, whether I buy them myself or read the magazine at work.  I would say that if you wanted to purchase a magazine this would be a great one to choose because the magazine reaches out to any one in their teenage years and up

ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY really understands the whole arena of entertainment from film to television to DVD to music to games to even hand-held media for your phone like downloads, mobile ringtones and even book reviews. Plus you can search the archives of Entertainment Weekly for almost any article ranging in categories from Pop Culture to Photo Galleries, to their annual lists which include such top ten lists as the hottest American Idol performances ever, most memorable gay couples even before Brokeback Mountain to the most embarrassing sex scenes in the movies. The magazine has been publishing since 1990 so it has chronicled the rise of the star director, star writer, star-producer and the hyphenates -- actor/producers, actor/directors, actor/writers etc. And it's seen the rise of HOLLYWOOD USA and HOLLYWOOD WORLD where popular culture seems to impact every aspect of our lives from how we live to the clothes we wear to the food we eat to the cars we drive. Don't miss their LISTS -- who's who in various categories like the "IT LIST" to the "POWER LIST" to the "ENTERTAINERS OF THE YEAR".

I love this magazine and I look forward to getting it in the mail every single week, unless if the last one was a double issue. Then I have to wait another whole week, which can sometimes be painful. I love the reviews and the magazine is funny, fresh and it keeps me up to date on movies, TV, music, and DVDs. The onlt complaint I have is lately they don't have as many reviews for urban releases

Like my fellow choc-o-holic white brother, Floyd's Garage, I too get weird and sometimes disgusted looks from some lame pastyfaced, flatbacked white girl at the counter. What I do when I put my "Black Men" or "King" magazine down on the counter is make comments like... "I love black women," "Black Women are the best," or I might mention to those most obviously in the negative... "You wish you had some butt and hips like these girls, now ring me the f--k up!

Only thing I do not like about this rag is why use such an exclusionary name? Should oldfart and lame "Playboy" or those mags out there which are in celebration of anorexia like "Stuff" or "FHM" call themselves "White Men" ?!
No! Of course not! So let's all just chill and enjoy these black beauties.

As a white middle-aged male, I always get strange looks from the counter girl when I buy my issue of Black Men. I don't know why though, where else can I do my research? Every white man's dream is a six-foot, big bootied, large breasted, black woman with straight silky hair. It is my dream to marry one. So when I'm cruising the turfs in my pimped out ride, or hip-hoppin' at the club, I gotta have the knowledge I need to hang with whatever ebony queen I have the priviledge of bumping into.

You can't fake your front. It's a lot more than just bling, 40's, and expensive hubcaps. A hard core wigga's got to be down with the scene. Latest trends like music, fashion, and political viewpoints are all covered extensively and it makes it so much easier for me. Could you imaging me walking into Tobie's Lounge with a jogging suit listening to Vanilla Ice? No, I got to fill my dome with the cutting edge jive needed to be a true playa.

Watch out you African Princesses. White dudes want you and we read this mag to better our chances. We may not wear Raiders caps with the tags still on them, but we are listening to 50 cent. 

Once you go white, you'll be feeling alright. Peace

This subscription is the way to go if you are sick and tired of finding the last copy of Q magazine for sale on the newstands is missing the 'enclosed' CD because some chump has stolen it before you could.  This rock music magazine is superior to others on the market, in my opinion, because it has excellent production values, i.e. luxuriantly thick and glossy paper and high quality reproductions.  As a bonus, the writing is superior and highly imaginative.  An expecial favorite section of mine is the 'man on the streets' section in the back where concert goers are canvassed for their opinions on the show they have just watched.  I like it because the reporter is sure to get a good cross-section of the audience and it clues one in on the reaction different types of people have to the band.  In addition, this magazine covers US and worldwide bands that may not be as well-known here in the USA as they are in UK; often these are bands that we might want to know better.  The reviews section is always great, and usually the magazine will highlight a mini-section e.g. 'Best R&amp;B albums from the 1970's, in which lost gems are rediscovered for the reader who may be too young to remember or even know about these artists.  This magazine will have you finding, buying and liking albums by bands you've never heard of, and who can beat the home delivery aspect for nickels more than the newstand price

"Discipleship Journal" does what many other Christian magazines do not do. It provides instruction, and challenges the reader to be directly and fully engaged in a Christ-focused faith. While others may talk about Christianity, DJ asks you to pursue Christ through responding to Scripture.

This isn't an evangelistic magazine, like "Decision," or an encouraging magazine, per se, like "Moody." It is for the Christian looking to grow in his or her faith by examining themselves and what God's word says.

It is not for the passive pew sitter. This for the Christian who wants his or her faith to impact the days between Sundays.

There is nothing watered-down here. It is published by NavPress, who, like their counterparts, the college ministry Navigators, know the crucial necessity of biblical study by the everyday Christian. Whether it is a discussion about Satan's favorite lies, how to study a particular book of the Bible, or an explanation of what prayer is an is not, DJ is the sort of publication that will cause you to pause mid-page and realize something new about our Lord and his ways.

This is a great tool for two or three people to use together. Even a small group... to go through the articles, week by week and discuss them and what this means in real life. I've even heard of CCD and Sunday school classes asking everyone to read selections from a certain issue as fodder for the next week's class.

I fully recommend "Discipleship Journal." Expect your faith to grow.

I've been reading Men's Journal since the first issue. I've always enjoyed its mix of content. MJ interviews a wide range of interesting individuals. Over the years I've incorporated some of the workout tips from MJ's fitness pages into my workout routine. I especially enjoy reading the product reviews. The travel recommendations are always well written, if not sometimes beyond the budget of most readers (myself included!). Overall, Men's Journal offers a great mix of well written content

Men's Journal has gotta be one of the best deals in the whole wide world of magazines. For 10 bucks you get wonderful photography, health tips, product reviews of cool stuff you'll covet, smart writing and, of course, regular features by that greatest of American ink-spillers, Jim Harrison. Heck, if they just photo copied the Harrison pieces and sent them to me in a plain white envelope, ten bucks would still be a screaming deal. However, I still dig the fashion spreads, the book notes and the travel writing. There is a consistant sense of adventure, curiosity and life well lived in this magazine, which is why it should earn a spot on your coffee table. Did I mention it's only ten bucks

My husband and I love getting our monthly subscription. We read it to each other in the bath tub and get all hot and bothered. We often talk about the stories inside and discuss our interest in the fantasies we've read about. Variations has definitely led us to try a lot of fun things together.

If you find yourself interested in trying some of the things you are reading about in this mag, check out Intense Games DVD, it is an adult party game that makes fantasies reality. Really

I love Glamour!  This has to be my favorite magazine of all times!  Granted the ads drive me nuts but I love the Do and Don'ts and all the clothes.  I am a shopping mogul!   This magazine is great for showing new trends and I love layering and almost always they are showing new ways of layering clothes and teaching you how to wear your clothes in a different exciting way.  I also enjoy the articles and life lessons as there is always something that I am interested in.  I read Glamour almost from cover to back!  I rarely skip articles!  If you like fashion and just articles on every life issues this magazine is for you!

**I have noticed a change over the last year in the magazine, but it is not terrible.*

I've had subscriptions to just about every woman's magazine there is over the past 8 years, but the only one I always renew is "Glamour".  It's less "how-to-catch-a-man" oriented than "Cosmo", less pseudo-hipster than "Jane" and less serious than "Marie Claire".  While it's certainly no "Ms." magazine, it has a lot of women-positive messages every issue, articles that aren't as sensationalistic and fear-mongering than most found in women's magazines, and lots of fashion and beauty tips.  I feel that "Glamour" strikes the right balance between frivolity and seriousness--for those of you who like a side of third-wave feminism with your fashion, I highly recommend it.

Kiplinger's Personal Finance is a worthy challenge to Money Magazine for a monthly dose of economic and investing trends, helpful financial tips, and - in KPF's case - a kind of populist advocacy for the little guy investor.

I came to KPF by way of the well-read hand-me-downs of one of Kiplinger Letters (for which, see elsewhere on [...]) that were pressed into my hands by my mother-in-law 25 years ago.  She probably thought that without I'd lead her daughter into the financial wilderness, where we would thirst and die in good romantic fashion. 

I eventually migrated up the Kiplinger food chain to the glossier KPF and have never left.

Much of the information provided by KPF (mutual fund and ETF results and the liek) are widely available. The same could be said of the investing advice (look for no-loads with low fees, diversify, don't bail under pressure).

Where KPF excels is in the short articles and tips, which have often prodded me to take money- and/or sanity-saving moves. Two fine recent examples: the articles in the September 2006 issue entitled 'Buy a 2006 car on sale?' and '5 things to ask about silk ties'.  Both of these articles provided solid input into two buying decisions I'm likely to make in the new year. What's more, the conclusions reached by these two authors are probably *not* the ones you'd anticipate.

In terms of marco-economic instincts, the Kiplinger Washington Editors run bullish, though not quite so much as Money's more cosmopolitan-posed writers. KPF won't lure you into buying quite as many fancy gentleman's toys either, a fact that is well observed by their authors, who tend to be mutual fund companies rather than designer suit or German auto makers.

Don't get me wrong, I read other financial rags and might not be as enthusiastic about KPF if it were my only source. But KPF's monthly arrival is still always welcomed, as it has been for years. It remains firmly entrenched in my top tier

My retirement plan sends me a magazine, which is so boring that I don't even bother to open it anymore; Kiplinger's isn't at all like that.  The best part of Kiplinger's is that it describes how real people with average salaries, kids, and debts can invest for the future.  There are also some great articles for parents about how to teach their kids to manage their money.  Everything seems practical, but I've yet to try any of it.  The magazine is broken into four sections: `Ahead' short articles about finance news and current event, `investing' about investing mostly stocks, `your money' about ways to invest your money though not as technical as the investing section and more diverse, and `spending' which is basically general interest about new fun technologies and other ways to spend all the money saved or made through investing

Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine fits right in the middle between the lowest-common denominator approach of Money magazine and the head-in-the-clouds attitude at Worth magazine. Kiplinger's has a nicely balanced style and tone; it never preaches, and I almost always find a tip, suggestion, or tax-saving idea that pays for my year's subscription in every single issue. If that's the measure of the value of a personal finance magazine, then Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine deserves a five-star rating. Good stuff, and a good value

I've read other personal finance magazines before and found them to be either too basic to be worth my time, or too focused on some obscure area.  I'm not a financial professional, but I like to constantly increase my knowledge of personal finance.  Kiplinger's has been great for that.  I skip 80% of the articles in this magazine, but that still leaves one or two in every issue that teach me about an area I didn't know about -- where to buy bonds online the most cheaply, how to find good financial advice, why options are priced the way they are.  One good article pays for the entire annual subscription.  Each issue has a wide range of articles appealing to lots of levels of experience

I read the review Marci Carl about the Jennifer Chiaverini books The Quilter'ed Apprentice.  I am as totally hooked on these books and have them all now as I am your magazine.  Then I had to go get on the computor and found Jennifer's site.  Now I want to get back into quilting big time.  My husband just rolls his eyes.

I am really liking this magazine already because it focuses particularly on multicultural and biracial marriages, brides, grooms, weddings, everything!
 This mag focuses on brides of every color and overall just average brides in general.  There is focus on how to incorporate dierent heritages into the details of the wedding from the gown to the reception.  I also really enjoyed the little feature on biracial celebrity pairs and of course the gorgeous ring and gown spreads!
I definitely recommend this magazine if you are in a biracial relationship, blending two cultures into one wedding (or both!), or maybe you just want tips or ideas so you can plan a unique around the world cross cultural wedding just for fun.  If an all white wedding is not for you in more ways than one than this is the magazine to pick up

Family Circle is aimed at female readers with articles focusing on topics like parenting, marriage, etiquette and beauty and fashion. Each issue also features an article on Women who make a Difference. There is also a Health Report article, fitness articles, and diet tips, including menus and recipes. There are lots of recipes, in fact, including pull out recipe cards that can be filed in your recipe box. There are also articles on gardening, decorating ideas, and craft ideas. A reader's tip column pays readers $50, if their tips are used.

Family Circle is a good magazine for all women.

This is the third time I have purchased Handyman Magazine for family members as gifts.  This time, I misunderstood how to gift the item.  Unfortunately, I did not have a second chance to send the magazine to a family member as a Christmas Gift.  After calling, the only recourse I was given was to to refuse the magazine when it comes (because it is coming to me instead of my son in Atlanta), call and cancel the order and reorder.  Unfortunately, doing this, it will not reach my son in time for Christmas.  I would like to see something built into the system that gives a second chance to bill me, but send as a gift

My ONLY gripe with this magazine is that the pictures are like those you would find in GQ magazine: they hire models to show you driving a nail or shoveling dirt for that new patio.  These people use only brand new tools (brand name label showing of course) in a perfect-world dust free environment.  The pictures make it look like it's a Sears catalogue.

Aside from that, the articles are great making it one of the best magazines for the do-it-yourselfer.  I have saved more money from the tips in this magazine than any other magazine I subscribe to.  Most articles can be done by any semi-skilled craftsman with access to a decent set of tools, making it an approachable magazine for the DIY'er.

I highly recedommend this magazine in conjunction with Fine Homebuilding magazine.  In that magazine you will find that the pictures are of real people operating used tools in a real environment.  The articles in Handyman are a bit more down-to-Earth, but together you will get the most benefit

This is one of the best sources for ideas on home improvement.  Beyond the great ideas, they also give you detailed directions on projects along with a good number of pictures.  I have learned how to do a great number of things I used to hire others to do because I thought I didn't have the skills - they make most projects around the house seem accessible, but not by oversimplifying the process.  Some may argue that they give too much detail, but this is essential for anyone new to a project and can be breezed through for those that are more experienced.

The only downside is that they give you ideas for things you never knew you needed!

This magazine is a great way to get a book club to focus on what to read next. Basically the magazine is a collection of all sorts of "Best" lists to suit every taste. The "Selections" page starts with a collection of "staff favorites"  highlighted with a one-(don't bother)-to-five(rarely given, a timeless classic) star rating system. There's a digest of 27 "best books 2005" lists in a recent issue, a page on the Whitbread awards, a selection of current and upcoming books, reader recommendations, new in paperback, a year in books (e.g., 1981)etc. Coupled with very little advertising, it's great!

I am so happy that there is a market for this magazine. The mantra of the book is dead people is thwarted by this pub. I scribble down scores of books each issue that I have to read and it reawakens my interest in books that I missed when they feature classics. I buy more books than ever now thanks (or maybe no thanks) to this magazine

I stumbled across this little gem almost by accident, and what a surprise it was.  The sheer breadth of subject matter could span half a lifetime.  We never forget the lessons of our youth, and each issue, like a great short story, will separate you from the mundane and transform the way you view literature.   And yes, you will return...time and time again. Are you trying to decide whether to devote your summer to reading Anna Karenina?  Perhaps it will ignite in you a love for the Great Russian novels, providing fodder that, like all firm foundations, could change the course of your life.  If it's the modern classics that you're interested in, one almost can't help but think along the lines of John Knowles.  Life marches on, and we choose whether to change or be changed.  Much is out of our control in this world, but what we choose to read is not. Regardless of your personal paradigm, you will find much of interest in this cleverly constructed work.   While the idea of a Holiday gift might seem obvious, why not consider surprising and old friend with a subscription? Does your friend really need that Springsteen coffee table tome?  Even as a belated wedding gift, it would no doubt be appreciated.  Don't stand around in bookstores, Starbucks in hand, flipping through page after page anymore...Oh, you don't do that, huh?  No, neither do I.  Just subscribe now.  I hope to find one in my mailbox soon.

Magazine review by Viola Beauregarde, 11.13.2005
The Fractured Chronicles [Blog]
http://violabeauregarde.blogs.com

Out of all the literary magazines I have read over the years, Bookmarks Magazine is one of the finest.  It offers the reader not only an in-depth listing of the newest literature in print, but upcoming books, books to movies, and old favorites.  Each book is rated from the best to the worse review in order to give a broader and more balanced perspective.  This also includes critical summaries, which are invaluable.  The insightful author studies give the reader a concise and informative glimpse at the author behind the literary work.  

If you only subscribe to one literary magazine this year, spend your hard-earned money wisely and get Bookmarks Magazine.  Believe me, you will not be disappointed

I go to a gym where people share their magazines, and came across this gem. While it focuses on value vacation packages, the benefit that I've gained from it is its list of 40 top vacation packages to destinations around the world. The magazine also offers an up-to-date web page describing even more places and bargains. It has really expanded my horizons about possible vacation spots. That alone is worth the reasonable cost

Budget Travel is a quite a neat colorful magazine and is loaded with exotic far-away landscapes that do what they are designed to and give one a lift into dreamland. I also like some, not all, of their articles which tend to be well prepared and nicely written.

However, at the same time, it does need better organization as compared with (Horrors)Conde Nast.

I am diverting a bit but you may as well know that accessing your web site is impossible - I cant access it!!

What I like about this magazine is that it does not focus on mainstream attractions and destinations.  It tries to go off the beaten path, and provides many suggestions of places to visit, restaurants to eat at, and even specific places to shop.  Not only that, on every issue they have a list of awesome travel tips provided by travelers.  In addition they list great travel specials and the corresponding websites.  I've been a subscriber for approximately 6 months, and I have to say that I enjoy this magazine.

This magazine has beautiful pictures, heartwarming stories and as a bonus, a laugh or two.  It covers the countryside of all of the United States and reminds you of a slower, more genteel time.  It makes you want to plan a trip to view the scenery for yourself.  If you long for life outside of the city, you'll enjoy this obvious labor of love

Asimov's provides 11 issues annually, packed with science fiction novellas, novelettes, short stories, poems, book reviews, and editorial articles.  As with any anthology or anthology-magazine, the story quality varies, but there are some true gems.  Alan M. Steele wrote a series of stories for Asimov's, beginning with the wonderful "Stealing Alabama" and including the stunning "The Days Between".  These stories were later combined in the novel "Coyote".  One value of this magazine is to introduce readers to authors they do not know.  Several years ago, George R. R. Martin wrote a short story for Asimov's that I found enthralling.  It turned out to be a portion of Martin's then-upcoming novel, "A Game of Thrones", which is in itself the first in a series of books (now going on four, rumored to be seven overall) called "A Song of Ice and Fire" and that is probably my all-time favorite fantasy series.  Overall, Asimov's is a science fiction buffet; you get a little taste of everything, some of it good (Kage Baker's "Company" series), some of it great (Martin's and Steele's above-mentioned stories), and some of it that you take a bite and leave the rest for the bus-boy (I don't care for Elliot Fintushels' "Izzy" series)

I am not a big magazine reader -- never have been, never really had time to!  However, a friend of mine at work kept bringing me copies of this magazine to read...after falling in love every time read it I finally I had to get a subscription of my own!

This magazine covers everything! It's got tips for life, cooking, decorating, organzing, and getting the best deal for your money.  A lot of the stuff in here -- shortcut cooking ideas, for instance, are stuff that I use and apply to my normal life.

For example: the July 2006 issue has a dessert shortcut for peach cobbler.  The result of that recipe was a WONDERFUL dessert for my family of four that took me... less than 15 minutes to prepare and tasted great!  

They don't endorse products NEARLY to the same degree that most magazines do, and when they do it's in an article where they had comparisons done...always a recommendation, and usually more than one.  The important thing here is they don't say "buy this product" they say "buy products that have such and such feature, make sure it has this in it for silky smooth hair, and oh here's an example of what we're talking about."  They make you an informed shopper instead of just throwing products at you withotu reason or rhyme.

So, in conclusion, if you're like me and can use a few extra ideas about EVERYTHING in your life...this is a great magazine.  The information is helpful, applicable to normal everyday life...and it's not so full of ads that you want to choke the advertisers

I just wanted to comment on some of the other reviews that are posted here.  Many try to sterotype the type of readers who like Real Simple, well I love this magazine- and didn't manage to fit into any of there categories.  My aunt sent me this magazine and then I began to read it monthly, I enjoy the tips and sections like "No time to clean?, quick solutions for every room"- yes they do have product suggestions, but much of the information that is provided can be done with things you already have.  Others have called this magazine- " a slave to fashion", as a woman in her 20's I would say this magazine is the one that contains minimal clothing information.  Overall I enjoy this magazine, as others have mentioned the recipes are great and I always find plenty of good tips.  The photography and layout are amazing, I always use the old editions for reference or crafts

My mother bought me a gift subscription when I moved in to my first apartment. I love this magazine. I pass the recipies on to family and friends, who have enjoyed them as well. The simple solutions to everyday needs are extremely helpful and well worth the $30 or so for a subscription. I am buying it for a housewarming present for a friend this week.

...and while, yes, I've made comments in the past about how Oprah has changed a little, this is about a PUBLICATION.
I'm sure that the person who wrote that "this is just another magazine full of things one can't afford" reads fashion or celebrity magazines FULL of MANY things she can't afford. Advertising generates money and, while I don't like ads either, they are everywhere because advertising works. If you don't want to see them, don't buy magazines, watch tv or go anywhere. As far as the layouts being "too full of clutter" ...everyone has their own style. There are some people who like that look and don't prefer a pared-down, zen look.  Magazines are not about reality.  If they were, they wouldn't be plastered with plastic, bronzed 6' females who weigh 100 lbs. I'm originally from middle America, and nobody looks like THAT there. Just take magazines and ads for what they are. Save your money, like I do, for things you just HAVE to have. If you don't have the perserverence to do that, then stick to the Target and Walmart circulars. The knock-offs are never far behind.

First off, most people don't buy this magazine in order to salivate over what they don't have but desperately want--at least, I don't.  This magazine is a wonderful inspiration for those of us who are interested in making the most of our home and free time.  Isn't our home supposed to be a haven?  Someplace to return to from the hustle, bustle and craziness of the day and just relax and spend time making memories and creating joy in our lives and of those we love.  This magazine simply caters to people with that ethic.  It's always full of ideas--both trendy and traditional.  It's not full of "BUY, BUY, BUY!" hyper-consumerist propoganda--it simply presents current trends and new ideas to keep your haven fresh and fun.  Anyone with a lick of sense and an ounce of self-respect doesn't turn to home magazines looking to be led, like a sheep, into the latest buying frenzy.  Most of us are smart enough to flip through the pages and get ideas of things we like and then find clever, inexpensive ways to incorporate them into our own lives--on our own budget.  This magazine is always full of beautiful pictures, great advice, and even terrific information about how and where to find bargains.  Mainly, though, it's about making the most of what you've got, and using your free-time to truly enjoy life to its fullest.  Don't fall for the neosocialist rhetoric of the first review.  This magazine is worth every penny

I have been a regular subscriber of sci fi mags for just about the past 15 yrs or so.  It all began with Omni and when Omni folded, I found a a copy of Science Fiction Age.  I had been subscribed to it for about 2 years before it folded.  I found a few Omni-like glossy mag twins thereafter, but they all folded as well.  Finally, I found the magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction and Analog and have been consistently subscribed to other for the past 10 yrs.  Both of the latter are outstanding 'zines but for me, Analog is the best because it satisfies the craving for hard sci fi and *fact* at the same time.   If F&SF & Analog ever have to close up shop then I would hope they would merge because then I'd have my hard sci fi, fact *and* horror/fantasy all in a one stop shop.

This magazine is like no other. The interviews are fantastic, the pictures are great, and it's very original. I can understand people not liking it if they're used to and prefer the typical, predictable magazine format.

OK. For those of you who continue to believe that New York is the center of the United States, Hell, the world, who forgot the map CNN kept flashing with the two different colors after the election that MIGHT infer there are several schools of thought about the polycentric views of the US, for those of you who can take a little criticism from the midwest, the dark states, middle earth, the Elba of the 21st century, you're not.

There's a whole world out here. People have jobs. Yes, it's true. We work, send our kids to school, even go to church on Sundays. And on other days too. We vote. Oh, yeah, you already know that.

So having an interview with an actor who goes on about how he meditates, is a vegan and thinks about trees and birds when he has a particularly stressful scene with Ashley or Uma or Diane, you know, it just doesn't carry a lot of weight with the serfs. But . . . .

It's a great magazine. Andy lives. Photography is tight and realistic. The ads are sexy and provocative. The sidebars interesting and insightful. It's wordly. It covers music as well as RS. It's (don't get all riled up now) a fun magazine to read. 

However, the interviews which we are led to believe are the heart and soul of the magazine, seem to be along the lines of 'damn, it's so good to be me and I guess you're OK too.' Or, 'I see you're wearing a $15,000 Versace with a plunging neckline and . . . you've selected old, black, Converse All Stars to wear with it! How Noveau! How tasteful!'

Come on. Where's the bite? Where's the interview with Alex Rodriguez that says 'how come you went to therapy . . . it's only New York?' or with Marv Alpert 'hey what's on your fashion agenda now?'

Chris Berman from ESPN says he was on Maui a couple of years back and he was walking with his kids one dawn and he ran into Steven Stills with his kids. Now that's a conversation I would have liked to hear, not one that ends up with me thinking the two parties to the conversation (it sure isn't an interview - see Columbia University's Interviewing 101 in their School of Journalism) are off to pick out furniture.

It's New York. Show your teeth. Flex. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury

This magazine is published every month. For me it's a big event. I can't wait to finger though the pages, look at the articles, and read the columns from my favorite writers like Molly Ivans. If you are a conservative this magazine is not for you but if you are a moderate, or some where on the left you will love this magazine! Senator Robert Lafollette R-WI originally founded it. He ran for president in 1924 under the Progressive party (which has since died out). He received 4,826,471 popular votes and 13 electoral votes. It was one of the first publications ever to publish the writings of  Martian Luther King and has since been a strong voice against the war in Iraq. This magazine should be cherished for being well progressive.

I believe that this magazine is a must have for any designer. Especially those that are new to the field. I am a student and I read this magazine from cover to cover and feel that it covers all aspects of the business well. It is written so that even the beginner can understand all of the aspects and use the ideas in their everyday work/projects. I think that this magazine is one of the best references for graphic design on the market that I have found

As a renter of a new house that is completely empty, I needed some ideas for decorating every room.  I'm thrilled with Home Magazine!  It's got creative ideas for everything from table lamps to kitchen remodels.  And they always list websites for where to buy the products right on the page by the product!  It doesn't get much easier than that.

Okay, it's not one of the fancy, traditional mags but I found loads of things that generated ideas. The sections showing design elements carried through the house were my favorites.  It may be on the advertising end of the spectrum in some regards, but I liked seeing similar (but different) approaches to the same design goal by various manufacturers.  Having all the web addresses made it easy for me to follow-up on designs I liked, and I didn't have to worry that the editors were trying to curry favor with their advertisers by pontificating on the merits of one item over another.

I'm a visual learner and this fit the bill. Unlike another reviewer who would suggest that this is due to my gender, I think that people respond differently to the same presentation of material.  Don't write this off because it's not a marquee magazine--try it first.  You might just like it.  And by the way, I do read and like magazines and books that have no pictures, too

This is a magazine I frequently get confused with Foreign Affairs magazine. The primary difference is the longer well-written essays by leading experts in Affairs whereas Foreign Policy has a more frequently published, more up to date and more direct version of the other. It would be great to have both since Policy keeps you more current with a high degree of professionalism while the other gives you the deeper detail. If you don't have a lot of time to read, Policy is the one you'll need and enjoy.

When I was little, my dad always said good things about this magazine.  My attitude was always &quot;I'm not gonna buy a magazine to bore myself some more&quot; - I mean, c'mon, it's a history magazine.  I was absolutely wrong.  I picked up this magazine one day and I was hooked.  I would say that American Heritage has found its way to make history interesting.  One way that it does this is to somehow weave issues of current interest (as subtle as they may be) into its articles.  On the second thought, I should have listened to my dad from the beginning - he's an anesthesiologist - he knows what put people to sleep and what does not.  This magazine keeps me awake - sometimes I would put my paper/project aside just so that I could finish my copy in one sitting.  It's unfortunate that this magazine only comes out every two months.  American Heritage makes history grrreattt! ... even for a non-history buff in his early 20's like myself

I only got the first issue, but it seems to be focused more on poets than other writers (hence the name).  i dont enjoy poetry but i love writing fiction.  They might do well to keep the two separate, especially the contests and events.  It's an attractive format and very upscale, high quality literature reviews and advice.  The stories are well written and enjoyable, although i think writers digest offers more for fiction writers

There are a few magazines about writing serious writers need to read. "Poets & Writers" is one of them. It has a literary bent, but avoids the nose-in-the-air attitude. It is practical and educational, and is pleasingly presented.

A favorite factor for me are the long feature articles on the culture of writing. In the issue out now, there are two major articles. One is about author Stuart Dybek and his fiction that pulls from his experience growing up on Chicago's colorful South Side. The other is about writing contests, dealing with how ethical they are run, the view of literary judges, and when a writer should considering entering one.

The secondary articles are as informative and as useful, whether you want to learn about promoting your book, doing online workshops or understand the trends driving the industry.

Contests, incidentally, are a big part of PW's value. The magazine tells you who won, and which contests/grants are currently accepting submissions. PW is careful to screen which contests are listed, ensuring only legitimate ones make it through the editors.

The writing itself is interesting. It is not always true that writing magazines are fun to read. It should be, and in the case of PW, everything is engaging.

PW's design is clean. It looks like what a small press literary magazine should look like. The typography and layout are not pretentious or overbearing, but get the job done. It is never work to read this magazine.

I fully recommend "Poets & Writers." You will be better informed about writing and writers, just like the titles implies.

I was annoyed that this magazine seems to equate "mature woman" with "has kids".  I enjoy the realistic fashion tips and advice, and I get annoyed with Cosmo's teenage attitude, but I'd like to see more about careers to balance out the "how to be a mom who does it all" sections.  And yes, I'm not kidding...there's a regular section on being a mom who does it all.

This mag will appeal to those who are in the mom/work category.  Those of us who do not have kids but are still "grown up" will be a little left behind

I got American Girl when I was nine. and now im going on my thirteenth birthday and still love it. I think you can be intreseted in Teen People type magazines but still love American Girl. It has lots of crafts and my favorite part-the "lunch box" section where they have ideas for food to make and take in your lunch to school. It is a short magazine, but they make up for it by having the JUMBO summer issue. I think its definitaly worth the money.

Men's Health is one of the most popular men's magazines because it meets the various expectations and needs of the modern man. You simply have to know about fitness, dieting, supplements, fashion, gadgets, etc. The annual subscription makes it a bargain and you get so much information for a few bucks. One of the most interesting sections is the one dedicated to bedroom activities. The tips are definitely useful and yet I highly recommend in addition the bestseller "scientifically guaranteed male multiple orgasms and ultimate sex" for the latest secrets in this area. Another key feature of the magazine is that it motivates you to stay healthy, lean and fit. There are weight loss tips, advice on how to eat and exercise in order to see results fast. This is important part of keeping sharp appearance. Overall, I can reasonably say that you will learn a lot, have fun reading it and most probably it will help you up to a certain limit to be a good looking man and great lover

I frequently read 'New Criterion' articles on the 'Arts and Letters Daily' website. They are usually of high- quality and well- worth reading. 
Hilton Kramer and Roger Kimball the editorial writers, Mark Steyn the drama critic ( And also one of the best writers on world- affairs around) Jay Nordlinger (The music critic) are among the regulars in a solid and respectable cast of writers. 
The great Joseph Epstein also writes here.
The articles in 'The New Criterion' give the sense that there is a living 'high culture' , and this in spite of the often critical stance to many modern cultural developments.

Intelligently written, beautifully illustrated and designed, this magazine is a must-read for beginning book collectors and veterans. It should be of interest also to non-collectors or accidental collectors who just happen to love books. Great features on authors and genres will interest many; succinct departments will help novice and experienced bibliophiles

I'm a subscriber to Road & Track, Car and Driver, and Motor Trend. Simply put, R&T is the one I look forward to the most each month. 

If you're looking for a well-rounded auto magazine, this is it. In R&T you'll find:
-Road Tests and First Drives.
-An excellent "Ampersand" monthly feature with all the latest info on future cars and prototypes.
-News about the latest races and drivers.
-Top-notch photography and art.
-Witty columnists. (see Side Glances by Peter Egan)
-The occasional technology-related feature.
-Classic cars, classic drivers, classic tracks. The best historical content in the business.
-Very little content on SUVs. (a positive in my book)

The competitors:
Car and Driver has substantially more road tests and previews, and some good specialty features on a pretty regular basis, but hardly anything on racing and history.

Frankly, Motor Trend isn't anything to write home about. The articles are shorter and less captivating, they can't seem to settle on a design theme, and they also have a lack of racing and historical content.

If I had to pick just one, Road & Track would definitely be my choice.

As with any profession or avocation or just down right fun habit, it is only as good as the tools you use. This magazine helps you keep up with the latest in the knitting world while still offering traditional patterns and methods.

There are lots of glossy shots of fibers and models with well defined patterns and suggestions. You can find many great ads and reviews of other reading material.

Lieven's article, &quot;In the Mirror of Europe: The Perils of American Nationalism&quot;;is succinct, cogent, and in my opinion frighteningly accurate. My experience as a professor convinces me that we are in the midst of a nationalistic arrogance, whipped by endlessly reptetiive mantras including 9/11, war on terrorism and god, which the majority of my students now accept as truth. I have one suggestion, I think Mr. Lieven is overly optimistic when he comments that the neoconservative empire-builders are not yet the majority in positions of power. I feel their reach inlcudes the legislative and executive branch, much of the leadership of coporate America, an increasing number of Jewish and Christian denominations, much of the media-particularly AM talk radio, higher education, the military, and with another four years of the current administration, federal courts at all levels. I will bring up this article in many of my discussion groups. I think the article was well-written and important, my congratulations to the author

As a subscriber to Martha Stewarts magazines I have to admit this has become my favorite, simply because its concise and interesting to boot.  Love the Week End dinner section, as well as the Recipe Index at the front of the magazine which is helpful when I am looking for something quick to consider fixing, but do not have the time or desire to sit down and read the whole magazine. 

Some of the other regular features that I like and find helpful are the Cooking for One section, since as a widow I hate wasting food and know of many other singles who want to eat healthy but need some ideas.  Also like the Wine Basics section which has enlightened me on new wines that I now like trying.  In Season is a great section because it reminds the reader what is in season, which makes shopping and cooking easier. 

The size of the magazine is nice because it slips easily into my pocket so I can recheck it while shopping to see what items I have highlighted to pick up.  This is also a great magazine for couples, singles of all ages, which is refreshing since so many magazines are geared to upper middle class, 2.5 children homes.  And... the magazine seems to improve with each new issue

I have been getting this magazine for a year now. I have a few new favorites I make on a regular basis. The pictures are pretty. The prep times have been accurate for my cooking speed. The ingredients are all easy to find in my local grocery store. There is detailed nutrition info available for the dieters. So if you are looking for some nice new things to make this is a great way to find them.

Outdoor Photographer is the essential how-to and where-to magazine for the outdoor photographer. I would recommend it for all levels of photographic skill, although most discussions of technique are suited to intermediate to advanced skill levels. There is only occasional discussion of the most basic techniques, as would benefit beginners. There are, however, so many great ideas on where and what to photograph that I think beginners can get a lot out of the magazine as well. And you won't be a beginner for long. The "outdoor" in the title does not refer exclusively to nature photography. Most of the magazine is dedicated to nature photography,but there are frequent articles on travel, location, and other sorts of outdoor photography, as well. 

In Outdoor Photographer you will find how-to articles on lighting, exposure, filters, gear, preparing  yourself and your gear for the elements -be they arctic cold or rain forest heat and  humidity, along with some advice specifically for digital cameras and the digital darkroom. And you will find this information for everything from close-up to landscape photography. Outdoor photographer focuses primarily on 35 mm and digital photography, with an occasional article on medium format. The discussions of exposure, lighting and locations are applicable to all formats of photography, however. And there is George Lepp's monthly question and answer column for those questions on just about any photographic or digital imaging subject that are not answered elsewhere.

And now for the best part. Outdoor Photographer tells you where to get great outdoor photographs. "Favorite Places" is a one-page feature in every issue that tells you about a great place in the United States to photograph, what there is to see, and what time of the year is best. Be sure to save those in case you ever have the time and means to visit them all. In addition to "Favorite Places" there are featured articles in every issue that detail a place to photograph, how to get there, what to take, what to photograph, etc., frequently written by well-known nature photographers and accompanied by some of their terrific photographs. I counted 3 such articles in the last issue  of OP that I received. If you are  a photographer or hobbiest who is able to travel a lot, Outdoor Photographer is a terrific bargain just for the locations. And if you don't travel much, it will help you photograph your backyard and local parks and gardens well

In the years I have taken this magazine, I have noted that often covered material becomes tomorrow's news from the latest hot-spot in the world.  So prescient, it is eery - if you have any interest in current events, news or foreign affairs, this journal is a must read.  The contributors are a Who's Who of politics, science and business in the world.  Often the author list will become the under-secretary of state list in the next administration.  For example, the last issue discussed Avian Flu virus.  As a physician, I can tell you that these were excellent informative articles that explained clearly what was happening and what the danger was.  And now this stuff is on TV every day and I can amaze my patients with how much I know about the issue that no one else does.  Reading this will definitely make you look smart.  Try this experiment and see if I'm right.  This article is written in October 2005, days after receiving the October issue with multiple articles about China written by Chinese authors.  Of course that means that these articles aren't really useful for facts so much as they are useful for seeing what China wants us to believe.  I predict that China will be much more in the news in the next 6 to 12 months.  So put this magazine to the test and see.

One negative is that although the authors are bi-partisan regarding party, they are not "conservative".  You won't ever find pro-tariff, anti illegal immigration, isolationist, anti judicial activism or pro-life articles in here.  Indeed, regardless of which party an author supports, you can pretty much count on expanded government, especially one-world government presented as the solution.

And lastly, some of the articles are deadly boring and contain stilted, obfuscated, diplomatic jargon.  You will rarely find a simple, eloquent phrase, but you will often find ideas that will pop up in any analysis of the news.  Just realize many of these authors are diplomats and politicians whose careers depend on obfuscation and plausible deniability.

All in all, this is an extremely influential journal that is full of cutting-edge ideas.  Just realize that many of them may be wrong

I am not the only to think Jose Da Silveira is not straight. Now that his carrer is back on track, the affirmation of his gayness would be terribly damaging. I believe this is the reason this Yvette Linton-Smith has been hired to go along for a while to make sure ppeople, mainly women can look at him with envy and desire and continue supporting him. Imagine what would happen to his carrer if he turned out to be gay....just your little detective.

This is one of my favorite magazines, and the only magazine subscription I've ever given as a gift.  My list of recipients should tell you a lot about for whom this magazine is appropriate.  I've gifted The Floss to my 73-year-old retired grandma, my 23-year-old writer sister, my 40-year-old trivia buff co-worker, and my 15-year-old high school sophomore cousin.  You might call me lazy for using one gift to knock off a good portion of my Christmas list, and you're probably right.  But there's something in Mental Floss for everybody.  

I pick up a half-dozen conversational nuggets each month.  I probably subscribe to 10 mags, and I'd say this is the one I actually read every month.  Great stuff.  My highest recommendation.

Despite its name, this mag isn't just for brainy types.  Anybody who's interested in knowing more quirky, fascinating things about the world around them -- presented in a highly readable, humorous style -- will find 'mental_floss' a fun read.  Interested in the weird history of hackers?  Ever wanted to know how to grow your own organs or wrestle an alligator?  All written by your smart, funny friend from college -- or so the mag's super-accessible style will have you thinking.  A definite recommend

I've actually met people who have said, "I'm too old to learn new things." And younger folk who have said, "That's too much like being in class." If you're one of these people, don't bother with Mental Floss magazine, or with going to school any more, or for that matter, with continuing to be alive in the first place. Living is learning, and this magazine helps edify and entertain you while you're doing all that living and learning. Most highly recommended.

But if you like staying stupid, you're probably not reading this. Carry on, then.

P.S. To the person who complained that the editors correct their previous mistakes and clarify their obfuscations in each issue: you'd prefer the wide variety of publications and TV "news" shows which don't ever acknowledge human error? Good luck with that

If you want a magazine based on fashion but merged with stories and interviews of top celebrities, then W magazine is perfect for you.

This large magazine is not only interesting, but beautiful. It has pages and pages of high quality, remarkable photos. Not to mention tons of beautiful fashion ads. If you live for fashion, or if you simply admire it; you will get latched onto W.

Celebrities such as Kate Moss, Mary Kate Olsen & Lindsay Lohan have graced the cover of this magazine. Pick it up even if you're the SLIGHEST bit interested. You won't be disappointed

I love W magazine in all its oversized glory. Its frothy with articles for the affluent, gorgeous photography, celebrity interviews and other frothy delights. It aims for the affluent and its unabashed in doing so. Its amusing that certain people review on Amazon.com with their personal rants that have nothing to do with the product at all. If anyone works hard for their success then why should they be abashed for enjoying the good life and beautiful things? Its these people that W addresses, and its frothy and I'm going to enjoy it for all its frothiness

My initial reaction to this magazine was that this magazine is huge, and full of ads.  I also read Vogue, though, and to be honest, W has less ads in it.  W convieniently avoids the snotty air of Harper's Bazaar and Vogue while at the same time avoiding the trashy how to sex up your man type articles in Cosmopolitan, Redbook, and Marie Claire, and it also avoids the rampant celebrity worship of InStyle.  This magazine has excellent layouts, and from what I've read thus far, excellent-and very different-stories.  As a regular Vogue reader, I'm used to reading about older designers like Coco Chanel, the Versace and Prada lines, and reading about a small smattering of socialites, like Aerin Lauder, Paris Hilton, Jemma Kidd, Victoria Traina.  What is different about W is that it profiles the new and the modern.  An article in the September issue profiled Kate Spade and her new line.  Other articles talked, almost sarcastically about the latest exploits of the socialites, meanwhile talking about, in an article aptly titled "A Bag Called It" the trend of statement purses and their proper place.  W is also similar to Vogue that in addition to the good layouts, it has even better photography, there are no Photoshopped to death photos in here, and if they are, this student can't find them.  What I like most about W is its sarcastic wit, something that is lost in most magazines, many of which these days assume that everyone wants to learn the latest way to sex up their man, worship Teri Hatcher, or read dumbed down articles.

This is such a good mag! i loved all the crafts, animal pics, and other cool stuff. I learned how to feng shui your room and find out what a liger looks like. The jokes are funny too. this is one: What do you get when you cross a pig with a centipede?   Bacon and legs!. They also tell you cool facts like: Mona Lisa has no eye brows and most in england belong to the queen. So as you see this ROCKS! Buy it, buy it now.

This magazine does hold my kids' interest, and I feel it was worth the money for one year.  The articles and photos are meaningful and have helped get my kids interested in a variety of world subjects.

However, I probably won't renew because I feel the regular National Geographic Magazine is also suitable for kids and better in the long run.  I guess it would be good for parents to screen and limit use of the regular magazine with regards to the very young, but for the most part kids are exposed to relevant current issues at school and in the media anyway, so the issues and photos of National Geographic Magazine are not too adult or inappropriate.

OK, the advertisements are a bit much, but the magazine is great. My son has subscriptions to Cricket and Kids Discover, too. He has had many other magazine subscriptions over the years, and this one stands out to me because, unprompted, he has always found fun information that he felt was worth sharing. This magazine was also a favorite with my niece who does not like to read at all. The magazine format is easy to read, yet rich in content

The London Review of Books is, without a doubt the best literary journal in the world: at the same time erudite, entertaining and informative, each issue is a foray into a world of knowledge that is all too lacking in other publications and media. There was a time in my life when I couldn't afford to put my heating on in the bitterly cold British winter, but I never thought to cancel my subscription to the LROB. Highly recommended

The London Review of Books is simply the best generalist journal on topics of literature, the arts, culture, history, politics, philosophy published in the world today--it now beats the NY Review of Books in terms of giving you the full picture and leaves the TLS back in the dust.  If you want to get your bearings in the world of  culture and politics, this is must reading.

A great magazine that keeps getting better as time goes on. I have watched it from the start and have continued to be impressed by Editor Jason Sizemore's growing tome to the darker side of Sci-Fi. With solid Interviews and strong fiction by established pros like William F. Nolan, Ben Bova, Tom Piccirilli, Neil Gaiman and Brian Keene and talented newcomers like Bryn Sparks, Jenifer Pelland, and Eugie Foster you can't miss with this one

Under the Radar and Filter are the only music magazines I come near. I hear Mojo is just as informative, renovative, and enjoyable, but I'm a little too close-minded to care about other genres I... don't care much about. Fans of rock/pop/what the kids are calling "indie"/alternative/punk/post-punk/folk/!!!!, take a gander at this. 

And the covers are slick and durable. They don't look out of place sitting on a coffee table

Now i dont usually write reviews for things, but when i do its because i really like it or i really hate it. And i must say this is one of the best, if not the best music magazine out there. But before you go on if you like bands like simple plan or new found glory just stop and go read something else. this magazine is for indie rock fans or just plain rock. They give you reviews on at least 30 albums and have great interviews with artists. Now this is not like "Spin" who jumps on anything that is popular at the moment to make some money. I enjoyed reading this summers issue ( with Death Cab for Cutie on the front) so much that I ordered it the day i got the magazine. A must have for indie fans

"As we grow older and realize more clearly the limitations of human happiness, we come to see that the only real and abiding pleasure in life is to give pleasure to other people." ~P.G. Wodehouse, Something New

Creative advertising (love the GE firefly ad), practical advice for your home and luxurious perfumes all blend effortlessly throughout the pages of Real Simple. There I was wondering when I should replace a down comforter and this magazine had the answer. They also have some lovely quotes and ideas for decorating your home with Liz Claiborne home items, like the lovely bedding and towels. 

The do it yourself features are fun with ideas like a hostess gift you make up yourself with a basket and candles. Loved the articles like "organizing your recipes; 8 foolproof methods." But their advice on tossing cookbook in favor of just keeping a few recipes! Hello. There are some cookbooks you definitely want to keep. 

They always seem to put a spin on old favorites, like the modern cheesecake that is gourmet and elegant. The applesauce cake in the November issue uses chunky applesauce so people might think you spent all that time chopping apples.

My son is a sports junkie at 7 years old.  He gets really excited everytime the issue shows up in the mail.  It is an easy read for him and he loves the posters and pictures included in each issue.  If you have a budding sports enthusist I would definetly recommend this magazine.  Besides the more reading your child does, the better it is for them, no matter the reading medium.

Our Ranger Rick issues are used first as reading material, then discussion material, then project material (cut-outs, etc) then recycling to neighbors who enjoy them just as much.  Tear out posters line my son's walls. There is no objectionable material in the magazine, just wholesome, fun reading.  No political agenda is discernable from it, which is refreshing. As soon as it comes in the mail, my 10 year old insists on sitting right down and reading the whole thing through.  The knowledge the magazine imparts carries over into the school day, where his teacher is amazed at his recall and knowledge.

This is a light and colorful newspaper. I remember when it first came out .The idea was it would be a national newspaper and cover the United States as a whole. It does in a way and gives local news in regards to all the 'sections' of the country. The reporting itself is clear and very readable.
The paper lacks weight and depth. It has a lot of variety in its features, and clearly attempts to entertain the reader and somehow make the news more palatable.
It's not a great newspaper but it often features fine reporting. And there are times when it does a better job than more prestigious papers.

The Weekly Standard clearly has a conservatinve "bent."  However, it is not the sort that screams, "This is the ONLY way to think about this topic."  It is thoughtful commentary, delivered with well crafted writing.  I come away from reading an issue thinking that I have been well informed

One of the funniest magazines around.  In a recent article, the Weekly Standard proposed massively expanding the IRS to help pay for the massive debt and budget deficit.  Which group did the "Weekly Standard" say should be targeted for this increased IRS presence (and massive increase in tax rate - for some 100%)? The Entertainment Industry.  The reality tv show contestants, the teen-pop singers and the like.  The article noted that normally massive taxation would hurt an industry, but with all the people that really want fame, that go all out to get their 15 minutes of fame, the industry would continue along (I'm curious if O'Rourke realizes that the tax would be applied to similar writers).  Another O'Rourke article provided the readers with an alternate Inaugural Address by Bush (subtitle: "What if George W. Bush weren't a compassionate conservative . . ."; quote: "The media say that I won the election on the strength of moral values.  If the other fellow had become president, would the media have said that he won the election on the strength of immoral values?").

In all seriousness, this magazine is a very clear detailed neo-conservative look at the issues (neo-con? - interestingly, it would appear that many of the writers used to be liberals).  The magazine does not always present just the conservative perspective, and does not always agree with Bush. Another recent article was by a current liberal, ex-communist British writer and his reaction to George Galloway's testimony before the US Senate. An editorial in that recent issue was all about the dictator in Uzbekistan, an US ally in the war on terror.  The editorial notes that toleration of this dictator and his brutality will undermine Bush's current foreign policy.

It should be noted that the magazine does not seem to have journalists, and few staff writers, most appear to be called "contributing editors." 

It is jarring, though, when I read the magazine then read articles in some of my other subscriptions.  "Variety" and "Weekly Standard" rarely agree.  For that matter, I'm somewhat surprised by how often the "Weekly Standard" and "Business Week" disagree.

After reading a few of the other reviews, I am again baffled by the left/liberal take on things.  This is a CONSERVATIVE magazine!!  Liberals, open at your own risk!  You just MIGHT encounter a differing view point than you own!  Goodness.  The articles are informative, indepth, humorous, and thoughtful.  It's a good read.

 When I bought PC World at a store, the cover looked appealing. It had an advice on how to surf the Internet trouble free. So I brought it home and started reading it. I was amazed! I have never read a magazine cover to cover before, but I read this one word for word. This mag is filled with tons of reviews of best software and new gadgets. It also has unbiased articles written in a balanced simple English and technical language on computing in general. Perhaps the best part about the magazine is the CD they include with it. iT is filled with PC World recommended software that will make your life much easier.
 IF you never heard of PC World, you don't know what you're missing. Go to the nearest store and ask for the copy. You'll be glad you di

After switching from Mac OS to Windows a few years ago, I needed a PC-oriented magazine to get me well versed in the new vernacular.  I took a look at PC Magazine and was disgusted by the number of errors and the dearth of useful content; man, I thought, this is why Mac users laugh at PC guys.  Then I picked up PC World at the suggestion of a friend and, wow, within minutes I filled out the subscription card and sent for my subscription.

PC World is good because it's informative and useful.  It covers things you want to know as a PC user.  It does not slant toward hardware (like the modders-only Maximum PC) or software, and it doesn't waste space telling you why you should buy a Mac G5, which, oddly enough, PC Mag tries to do.  PC World is a well-balanced, informational magazine for general PC users.  If you want more expert-oriented stuff you might want things like Windows Mag or other more specific magazines, but for general computing, PC World is the best.  Each issue is packed with stuff you can use, either in your daily computing or to impress your friends at the new year's party

No ads. Large print. Beautiful illustrations. Interesting age appropriate stories. Every magazine by this publisher (Cricket, etc) are all quality magazines that are child centered. 

My daughter is five. I think this is a bit young for her but she loves it and 'reads' it cover to cover. She also enjoys looking at the pictures as well. 

This is worth every penny.

I love these magazines.  We subscribe to Ladybug, Spider, and Cricket (each for a different child).  The stories are great, as is the illustration.  An illustrator friend of mine says that it is very prestigious to be asked to illustrate a story in these magazines, and I figure it is the same for the stories.  No advertising, of course.  The thing I like the best is that each magazine is geared toward a certain age of child.  Highlights tries to be something for everyone, so we look through the magazine to find an appropriate story.  In Ladybug, we just start at the beginning and read straight through.  As the publisher will tell you, when your child outgrows Ladybug, you just let them know and they change your subscription to Spider (and later, Cricket.  That's as far as we've gotten)

If you really love sports, there is no finer magazine than SI.

The breadth and depth of the coverage is unequalled by any other mag.

The pics are the best on earth.

The writing is tops.

I've been an off-and-on subscriber to SI since I was a kid.  I've grown to love the magazine and idolize a few of the staff writers. Despite being the best, the magazine is far from perfect.  Lately, I've found that many of the articles deal with things that I, and many sports fans, probably don't care about.  And they give too much coverage to pro football when it's in season, even though I've noticed that the football coverage is among the worst in the magazine.  There are a few writers who I can't stand (die Austin Murphy!) and some who think they are better than they really are (Rick Reilly), and some who are underappreciated (Steve Rushin).  However, some of the finest reading I've ever done has been in Sports Illustrated.  There are some stories that stick with you for years.  SI beats the crap out of the terrible ESPN magazine, which seems more interested in comedy than in sports.

Vogue fantastic high fashion photos.  If you love to look at beautiful clothing and shoes you need to look at Vogue.  However, as other reviews have indicated, the articles are quite lacking.  They are often flat without much substance on topics that are frankly not interesting.  So, you get Vogue for the pictures.  If your looking to ogle pretty clothes or for inspiration for an art project this is a great magazine, if you want something to read get something else

This mag has its ups and downs but there is no other magazine with more class and originality. It's an icon all over the world. The editor has inspired books and movies for her perfectionism and professionalism. She and Vogue have gone a long way toward making women strong and independent. Without Vogue magazine fashion would not be a multi-billion dollar industry

Vogue used to be my favorite fashion mag out there, but today the advertisements are simply ridiculous. I think the ad to editorial ratio must by 90:10. It still has wonderful fashion tips, but the ads are becoming burdonsome. In Style has replaced Vogue as my #1 fashion mag, but I'll always be a Vogue reader

Harper's, like the Atlantic and The New Yorker is written for those looking for more in-depth analysis and coverage on political and cultural affairs with a sampling of serious literary prose.  Personally I prefer the Atlantic, which I read regularly, only picking up Harper's when I have time and something in it interests me, which is usually two or three times a year.

Just looking at the cover and pages inside convey Harper's as a serious tome, perhaps too serious for the casual reader, especially compared to the more colorful pages of the Atlantic and playful New Yorker cartoons.  Nevertheless, Harper's is an American icon in it's genre having published many articles from great names since it's inception in 1850.

A number of reviewers complain about it being left leaning and that stance clearly sprouts from the now recently departed editor Lewis Lapham, who has been an outspoken critic of the current administration.  Mr. Lapham shares his views in a two page opinion piece and in the full page listing of various "fun facts" known as the Harper's Index.  Serious readers will be able to get beyond this as simply a "viewpoint" and see the entire magazine for the serious writing that it is.  I would contend this represents the best in "critical analysis" rather than bias.  I would also simply suggest you view the other reviews made by people espousing this periodical as overly biased.  For instance, at least one of those claiming liberal bias here is also praising an Ann Coulter book.

So if you feel underwhelmed by the typical content you get even in a 60 minute broadcast or a political round table free-for-all and you're interested enough in this magazine to read it's reviews, you should probably pick up a copy of it for two or three months and give it a try.  I recommend you also check out The New Yorker and the Atlantic to compare

Harper's has been in business since 1850 and has published some of the greatest American- writers , from Mark Twain on down. Its editor and tone- setter is the veteran journalist Lewis Lapham. It publishes fiction, and articles including interesting symposia on many aspects of American economic, political and cultural life. It attracts the big - names in all areas, and also provides a lot of human - interest material, statistical curiosities, historical information and stories.
For some reason which I do not fully understand it has never been my great favorite. And in the old days I preferred 'the Atlantic' and the 'Saturday Review of Literature ' to it. Of course one of the features of 'Harper's is its book- reviews done by among others today, John Leonard. 
I suppose what has soured me a bit on 'Harper's' is its bias to the political left.
But that withstanding it still provides a rich mix of articles of high quality

I grew up reading Fangoria, when I could sneak it past my parents, that is.  Fangoria Magazine has a total respect for the genere of horror that comes shinning through with every article.  Now you are not always going to agree with everything they say, but you can always expect them to be honest.  When a horror icon is not performing up to snuff, like Stephen King or John Carpenter, they will be the first to point out the errors and flaws.  Fangoria also has the Chainsaw Awards, where you can mail in your vote for best horror movie, actor, ect, and you can also submit a name for Horror Hall of Fame (my guy has yet to win it).  They also spot light horror films that would normaly fly under the radar of most people; like the Japanese and Italian horrors (wow, they can make some splatter flicks), and more independent films that wouldn't be showing at the mainstream theater.  And they have pictures.  All the blood and guts you can imagine in beautiful color (though they have become more tame compared to what it was in the '80s).  This is just a great magazine to have if your a horror fan, I whole heartedly recomend it

I recieve different magazines over the course of a year. i don't know why. It simply happens that way.  Marie Claire is a pleasant surprise.  I found in the first issue I read, a group of writers, editors and all involved with this magazine, not just writing about issues, but being proactive.  Everyone on the street in NYC in bikinis and whatever each individual felt comfortable with, to bring awareness to skin cancer.  Really cool!  Each issue has write ups on a certain amount of relevant international and national news for women and other sexes too.  they are adding the right amount of consciousness to an otherwise totally fashion magazine which also i have found surprisingly refreshing and fun. Ace Job Marie Claire staff!!

The "New Yorker" for food is often how I describe this magazine to colleagues and friends. The articles are well written, though occasionally idiosyncratic.  It is one of two magazines I subscribe to (the other being the New Yorker.)  If the alleys and byways of food are as interesting to you as the grand boulevards, then this magazine will appeal to you.  It is not Gourmet or Martha Stewart (not that I have a problem with either of those titles, this magazine is just different), but if you enjoy food writing about varied topics from a slightly academic point of view this magazine would be a good choice

When WEIRD TALES was revived around 1988, I was sorely disappointed in the direction the editorial staff had taken.  It was too "progressive" and not enough like the old WT so many of us afficionados knew and loved.  Lin Carter had a great thing going for the four paperback issues he came out with under the Zebra imprint in the early 1980's.  Unfortunately, he was not allowed to continue.  His idea was to keep the FLAVOR of the old WEIRD TALES alive, and he did it very well.  

Then several years later along comes the the Schweitzer/Scithers/Betancourt WT, and my goodness it was sad to see the aura gone.  Gradually, though, WT has seemed to come along and put itself somewhat more in the direction of the "old-fashioned" 'zine it was in its heyday (1920's-1930's), although the editor Darrell Schweitzer would probably disagree with this observation.   Anyway, WT sports great covers now, good stories, and good book reviews, and interesting editorials.  I must say I miss S.T. Joshi's always very entertaining book reviews, but we can't have everything.  Scott Connors' forthcoming reviews will surely entertain, as do Douglas Winter's.  All fantasy lovers should buy this magazine to support the cause of fantastic literature, especially the dark fantastic; there are so few outlets of this kind now that WHISPERS and WEIRDBOOK, not to mention the long gone FORGOTTEN FANTASY, are no longer published.   Good job, Mr. Schweitzer, whether you realize it or not, your magazine has become a more cozy, old-style, aesthetically pleasing magazine, more in the true tradition of the original WEIRD TALES, thanks in no small part to the wonderful covers that have graced it in the last 13 or 14 years

I can hardly wait for my next copy to come.  I look forward to the magazine more than any other magazine I get and read every word in it.  I save them for years and go back to them as they have relevance years back when new books come out.  They give me pleasure with every read.  Even though I can read them on the computer I just love having them around the house so I can pick one up and see what was around months ago or years ago.  I'm a real fan.  I can't say enough.  I've given them as gifts to all of my friends that join audible.  I buy books I might not have noticed without reading about it in audiofile.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  What more can I say.  Keep them coming.

I admit it; I'm addicted ... not to the heavy stuff, but instead head-over-heels in love with audiobooks.  And they have found a friend in AudioFile, a truly wonderful magazine that informs addicts like me about the latest trends, equipment, books to hit the market. The down is that it's only published every other month.  I voraciously read it both on line and the "hardcover" edition that arrives in my mailbox.  Some other reviewer complains that the reviews are nothing more than recaps.  While they are short and to the point, I disagree about the contents of the reviews.  They're exactly what I'm looking for: an overview of the book, not an in-detail New York TImes type review.  If I want to learn more I then check with Amazon to see what others feel.  While I still purchase and read print books (they'll never go out of style!), I have found audiobooks a great alternative to curling up with Agatha Christie.  And, hopefully, AudioFile, along with my newfound addiction to audiobooks, will continue to prosper and grow.  It's good to be in on the ground floor

I find it to be the least biased among PC computer magazines.  Unlike most of its competitors, computer reviews are typically supported by objective benchmarks.  This magazine does not generally cover PC components such as cases, fans, and motherboards.  But it is immensely useful for their reviews of brand peripherals (eg, LCD, printers, graphics cards) and computers

Ladies Home Journal has several features that readers will like. One of the most popular is "Can This Marriage Be Saved" featuring a couple that is having marital problems presenting both their sides and then a counselor's advise. Other columns include "How They Met", "Animal Affairs", and "Raising a Family". Each month there is an article featuring a family that acquired a house through Habitat. A nice feature is a column presenting a man's perspective called "Heart of a Husband". There are also articles on beauty, health, travel, and parenting. There are plenty of recipes and craft and decorating ideas. Each issue also includes a couple of celebrity interviews.

I highly recommend subscribing to Ladies Home Journal, you won't be disappointed!

Video game magazines have been all the rage in our lives. Yet there are just so many of them that tell different stories for different video game systems. That has been the case with one of the biggest-selling ones of all time, Gamepro. They truly have made it one the most provocative and well in-depth magazines with detail about what games are popular according to their writers, and what upcoming games and systems are all in the works. The magazine is quite well, but I honestly do wish they could try to publish more in the way of codes and helpful hints for several games for Gamecube and Game Boy Advance, when most of it primarily focuses in on Playstation 2 & Xbox. Yet, Gamepro really handles itself as a very deep gamer's magazine. Anybody who wants to be enjoy the field of video games, this magazine is worth reading.

Overall: B 1/2

This magazine is great for beginning to intermediate digital camera users.  I think that it is especially great for beginners.  There are articles about how to choose the right camera for your purpose and about what all the specifications mean.  There are question and answer sections that answer a broad range of questions including how to avoid common computer errors and how to format different digital devices.  I like the photo editing tips, which explain some of the more elusive aspects of most digital photo editing programs and how to use them.  The photo-editing program described most often is adobe photoshop and photoshop elements; however, quick advice is also give about how to apply these tips to other programs.  For more advanced film camera users, there are tips for how to make the same quality image with a digital camera and stories of professional photographers who have switched to digital.  However, most professional photographers will use macs to edit their photos rather than PCs and more advanced photo editing software.  Mostly this magazine caters to amateur photographers and the lower end photo-editing programs that are most often used.  There are also reviews of new gadgets, which are often fun to read, and plenty of market place like advertising in the back. This magazine is what it advertises and nothing more

This magazine covers every aspect of horror/suspense culture, such as comics, books, music and of course, movies. The writers of the articles have respect for the craft involved in the subject, and don't just dwell on blood and gore (but have no fear, there is plenty of that).  Whoever designs the layout of this magazine does a beautiful job.  Lots of glossy photos and intriguing artwork, too.  Give this one a try.  I'll bet you'll love it as much as I do

Entrepreneur magazine is an easy read that allows us working professionals to have access to fresh ideas and interesting articles.I consider it a bargain given the amount and quality of information I receive for about a buck. There are a lot of ads and subscription offers to deal with, but that seems to be the case with most media. I do not consider this a substitute for reading books on business. It is a good complement however

Though the magazine does have the MLM and &quot;You To Can Get Rich&quot; articles, it has validity. You can do anything if you find the right thing, something your passionate about. I've found the articles may not always fit my exact situation, but I can extract what is meaningful or useful to fit my unique situation or business needs. Isn't that the main goal here? You have to find it, no one is going to hand it to you. Do the research and the work and ask for mentoring. Follow up on the leads and ideas they give you. I truly enjoy this magazine.  Carpe Diem

I've subscribed to OPM for four years now, and in that time I've never had any subscription or delivery problems. The writing staff is very intimate with their readers; it's almost like reading a magazine that a bunch of your friends wrote up. The reviews have mostly been spot-on for my tastes (compared to the awful, laughable insanity of PSM), and even though the Ziff-Davis crew members are "Official," they are fair. Also, and this is very, very important to me, their use of the English language does NOT suck like it does in PSM. The staff at PSM seem to be drunk most of the time, or maybe they just didn't make it through the second grade, I'm not sure - but their mishandling of prose is the main reason I dropped that subscription like a hot potato. OPM on the other hand seems to be written by college grads at least, and I appreciate that. Easy to read, filled with thoughtful insight, fair reviews, and a heaping helping of socially balanced humor, OPM is bar-none the best Playstation magazine you can buy

When funds were tight I had a difficult time deciding which magazine subscriptions to keep.  Each women's magazine has a slightly different feel in the writing, though with increased competition, these styles seem to be in flux.  I finally decided that I  preferred the writing in Bazaar and was getting tired of what I felt was Vogue's Cosmopolitan attempt to catch a larger readership (if I want to subscribe to Cosmo, I'll bloody well subscribe).  The featured designers are more cutting edge and less mainstream than what is found in Vogue.  It's a bit snottier (though there are far snottier magazines if you are looking for extreme fashions).  Among my complaints: Bazaar is an obviously thinner magazine, and while most of Vogue's content is adverts, it does seem to have more articles.  Another item that I find highly irritating, is Bazaar's society items.  I really don't give a ---- who is wearing what at what charity gala, especially when I don't play footsies with these people.  Those complaints aside, this is still my favorite fashion magazine

Before buying a subscription to this magazine I would suggest reading through an issue first, just so you are aware of what you'll be getting. No, it's not anything particularly challenging or mind-provoking, and the articles aren't scholarly or journal-worthy. But.. the articles make the subject accessible to the average reader, and do include insights into human behaviors and relationships that are fun and interesting. I am always engaged reading the articles, and find them topical and very current, unlike some psychology magazines which are too `deep' and drenched in older principles. This is a very `hip' psychology magazine and would be appreciated by those who are not necessarily scholars in the subject but who have a genuine interest in learning more. My favorite part is looking through the recommended books section, because there is usually something worthwhile to read

Touchstone features articles, editorials, book reviews and other material from the perspective of Protestant (both mainline and evangelical), Catholic and Orthodox Christians who hold to traditional, orthodox understandings of Christian morality.  It tackles the tough issues of our time both in scholarly articles and practical advice for parents who must raise children to be faithful in a post-Christian culture.  While it does not seek a false ecumenicalism which demands unity at all cost (see the July/August 2003 issue on "Christian Unity & the Divisions we must Sustain"), it also recognizes that orthodox believers of all three major branches of Christianity must work together on moral issues on which we all agree.

The publisher, the St. James Fellowship, also produces an excellent devotional guide: The St. James Daily Devotional Guide for the Christian Year, available by subscription though [...]

I am a new subscriber, have received two issues so far. This is a fascinating magazine, beautifully laid out, and well written. In the first issue I received (which I have now read almost cover-to-cover, something I Never do with magazines), there were articles about Dog rescue in Asia, the science of the historical relationship between Dogs and their humans, emotional vignettes about the love between Dogs and humans and so much more.
I like the reviewer who likened this magazine to the New Yorker about Dogs. The first issue was chock-full of everything from useful tips to weepy stories to fascinating science.
I made an effort to cancel all of my magazine subscriptions recently, simply because I do not have the time to read them all. This one will remain. In fact, I may start archiving this magazine-it is that good! All of our guests inevitable pick up the magazine, drawn by the crisp graphics, and retained by a healthy variety of reading.
Obviously, I am a fan. I have barely started the second issue, but from skimming the articles, I have full faith that I will not be disappointed.
Subscribe and enjoy

I've been a subscriber to REVOLVER for over three years now and I must say that they are the best "bang for your buck" music mag there is, period! They pretty much cover all the bases of heavy music (Extreme, Doom, Death, Grind, Metalcore, Hardcore even punk at times). I'd love to check out other metal mags, well the good ones anyways (BW&BK, Anvil, Terrorizer), Sorry but Hit Parader and Metal Edge are kinda lame, too little too late, but also, I simply don't have the cash for a $100+ subscription, all though you do get free sampler cd's with great bands w/ each mag, REVOLVER bust's you out w/ free mp3's each issue too, so you do get to hear something, even though personally I think they could be a little more cutting edge w/ their mp3 choices as they tend to stay in safe Territory as far as what they push, whereas Terrorizer and BW&BK really give you "Extreme" music to listen to, as well as their reviews (they have gotten a bit better). I am however a little pissed, as well as confused as to why I just renewed my 3 year subscription for $15 and it's only $10 even hear on Amazon... Promo? i guess. Oh well, simply put, this is the mag to get if you enjoy Metal Music magazines.

here are the great things about this magazine subscription

1. the unbeatable price, metal edge is $36 and it sucks

2. It has very interesting articles, artists tattoos a bunch more

3.Free music downloads!!!

Overall this is an awesome magazine, beating metal edge and hit parader into the ground. Unlike the other rock mags here you don't see mainstream bands like slipknot on every other page, it cover the lesser known bands too. The picture and paper quality
is excellent.

Again SUBSCRIBE NOW!!

Revolver's competing magazines in the heavy metal magazine world are Hit Parader and Circus. I have bought all three of these magazines several times, and Revolver my final judgement is Revolver is the only magazine that is good enough to subscribe to. The other two I still buy occasionally, but only for wallpaper (I cut out the pictures of bands in the magazines and hang them in my room.) 

	This magazine is, in a way, like a combination of Circus and Blender magazines; it combines the best aspects of both. Revolver still has plenty of great pictures, but it is also much longer and much better written than Circus. It is not quite as long or stuffed full of information as Blender, but make sure you note that Revolver only reports on one genre (heavy metal!) whereas Blender could (theoretically) report on every genre (rap, pop, rock, etc.)

	Chances are, if a hard rock band (especially a big name hard rock band) is about to or has already released a C.D., Revolver will do a story about it. The stories/reports are very entertaining but they also are informative and sometimes a lesson is learned from them. If it's a cover story, an interview with the band is also included; if it's not a cover story, the writer integrates quotes and answers from the band into the article, anyways (even though it's not a formal interview). Revolver writers frequently go on tour with a band (i.e. Lamb of God). In that case, they take the reader backstage, on the tour bus, and in a concert (with a rundown of the show).

	When I first started reading this magazine, there was a sexual theme to it. There would be a picture of a "hot babe" in a T-shirt, and one side of the poster would be a woman-usually half-naked-in a sexual pose. In the past year or so, Revolver phased that out (probably to appeal to a broader audience). I sometimes miss the pictures of the "hot babes," but this way there's more room for real heavy metal pictures. Yet, even though sex isn't a theme anymore, Revolver is probably a bit too sophisticated for anyone younger than a teenager. Plus, there are usually profanities (mainly the "f word.") So, I would say this magazine is for ages 13 and up.

Monthly articles:

-Cover story
-3 or 4 other biggish stories
- "Fresh Blood" column (where a small biography is given on a band you probably haven't heard of)
- Ask Vinnie (an column where readers write questions, and Pantera/Damageplan drummer Vinnie Paul gives advice)
- Hard rock news and notes
- Black and death metal news and notes
- "In the studio" (an update on bands currently recording new music)
-Free poster (in the middle of the magazine, there's a fold-out poster of one or two bands.) The poster isn't very wide, but it is about two pages long
-Free music downloads
-"Ink Spot" (a story about a musician's favorite tattoo)
-"Favorite sh*t" (an interview with a musician, with questions such as "What's your favorite color?")
-Joke from a band (Revolver has just recently started doing this)
- Reviews (reviews of C.D.'s, music DVD's, and video games)


Pros:

--Plenty of good pictures and a free poster
--Professionally written with well known writers (yet it is NOT too intelligent for teenagers)
--Edited well (I haven't found any mistakes or typos)
-The "fresh blood" column usually introduces me to a band I haven't heard of, but I should probably check out
--Revolver is accredited and well known enough to be allowed to go on tours with bands and be first for interviews
--News columns (on both mainstream and underground metal bands)
-The stories are always done with quotes from the band that the report is on
--Free music! (Revolver has started doing a page that gives the reader a password, which he/she can then access free music downloads online.)
--No stupid questions in interviews (they ask up to date questions, and sometimes-i.e. in the interview with Puddle of Mudd-the writers aren't afraid to ask daring, cutting questions)
--The "In the studio" segment is always informative
--Helpful, reliable reviews (they don't automatically praise every heavy metal C.D.)


Cons:

--If you're up to date on your music news web sites, the news columns shouldn't really be anything new to you.
--Not all C.D.'s are reviewed (they give a rundown on the C.D. in the article about the band, but C.D.'s from bands that are on the cover of the magazine aren't usually reviewed.) 
-Concerts aren't reviewed
-My biggest gripe is that it's only issued once a month.

	The bottom line is, if you're a metalhead, this is the best magazine you can get! It is more than well worth the ten dollars you will spend for a years worth of entertainment

I first picked up a copy of Nylon in Chicago, while browsing the newsstands. I wasn't sure if I would like it--years of subscribing to Vogue, Elle, and some stupid tweeny magazines had almost put me off magazine-reading for good. And yet I always manage to be drawn to the racks.

Nylon was different from the get go. They always feature unknowns on the cover, and when, on occassion, a well-known celebrity is featured, the stories give us a new perspective on them. 

Nylon is worth purchasing for the layout in itself. I could spend hours paging through each feature, marveling at the graphics, and the way the magazine is put together. I love how they base some of the beauty section on famous movies or bands.

Nylon also makes a point of covering bands, movies, and fashion designers that, until now, have remained obscure. Everything they feature is amazing--most of the music they recommend ends up on my Amazon wishlist!

I would highly recommend Nylon to anyone and everyone. This obscure magazine will stun you with its amazing artistic layout, and introduce you to new products you may have never discovered

Few magazines can match the New Yorker's high caliber of journalism, fiction, reviews, and of course, cartoons; all written by some of the best writers in the land.  It makes mainstream magazines like Time and US News look like high school newspapers.  But, one word of caution: if you're the type of person that whines "liberal bias" at anything that you slightly disagree with, then this is not the magazine for you.

I like this magazine and I subscribe to it (along with Cooking for Two and Cook's Country), but I don't think it's perfect.  I like when the magazine offers a several-page article with a formula for pasta salad or muffins, so I can make whatever flavor I choose and know it will turn out well.  But the magazine does contain ads, despite what one reviewer claimed

I don't know if anyone else out there has noticed this, but JANE Magazine has gone through an  A-M-A-Z-I-N-G transformation! I picked up the October issue this week, and was shocked to find out that it not only has gone through a visual transformation. (It now looks a lot like a hip, European magazine-kind of like "Jalouse", my favorite French publication), but also, the information provided inside is really valuable and applicable to my lifestyle. (I am 24) There's tips for decorating your home with cool silkscreened rock posters, delicious recipes for dinner guests on a budget, and really great fashion coverage that is not at all cookie-cutter and formulaic like some of the other women's books (aka Lucky, Glamour, etc) Also, the voice of the writers is so clever, and funny-I would hang out with these girls!! Anyway, I am not going to go on and on like a crazy person, but I was so excited that I wanted to share with u folks-Follow my lead and pick up a copy (or a subscription) asap!!

As someone who has recently become more interested in a healthier, organic way of life, I decided to check out several magazines on the subject matter.  Many did not strike my fancy.  For example, I found Organic Style Magazine to be a little too fashion and product-oriented for my taste, while Mind, Body, and Spirit Fitness seems a little too redundant and doesn't cover natural and organic living at all.  Natural Health, however, falls somewhere in between, covering a nice array of topics including fitness/diet, natural remedies, beauty, and food/recipes.  As someone who is not interested explicitly in holistic medicine and naturopathy, I appreciate the diversity this magazine has to offer.   

Though many of the articles do cover ideas and products that aren't entirely natural or organic, I still find them to be useful.  Many items and articles, though not all, are vegetarian-friendly as well as eco-conscious, which I appreciate.  One of my few complaints is that the articles can be short, sometimes merely "glossing over" many topics.  However, if one piques my interest, it can be a decent jumping off point to do further research.

Though I can't compare with the previous version of the magazine that everyone else seems to have preferred, as I only began to pick this up at my local whole foods market in the last year, I can say that I am impressed with what Natural Health has to offer it's readers.  Sure, there are several ads plaguing the pages, but I still feel as though there are far fewer advertisements than many of the magazines on the shelves today.  Besides, some of the ads have led me to decent products I would not have known of otherwise.  

Furthermore, at this price, how can anyone really go wrong

I have been a Smart Money subscriber for over three years. I must say that each month I look forward to receiving the new issue. It needs to be said (to those who aren't aware) that this is a publication of the Wall Street Journal. There isn't as much market news but the writing is just as good. From undervalued stock picks, to mutual fund screening and research, finding cheap bottles of good wine, car ratings, retirement planning and portfolio health - this magazine hits on many important topics for people in their working years. I find the writing to be accurate and insightful. I would still be a subscriber if the subscription was $3 per issue. That's the true value I find in it. Hands down it's the best personal finance magazine around. Head and shoulders above Money & Kiplingers

CEMETERY DANCE magazine is a World Fantasy Award winning magazine of horror, published bi-monthly, featuring short stories of horror and dark suspense, interviews with outstanding talent, and reviews galore. There is no shortage of opinions where products are concerned, with somewhere around forty-five reviews in every issue, including articles by writers Bev Vincent, Michael Marano, Thomas F. Monteleone, Paula Guran, Steve Vernon, John Pelan, Hank Wagner, Rick Kleffel, William P. Simmons, the list goes on and on. Writer Robert Morrish is the editor, Mindy Jarusek the managing editor.

The publisher and executive editor is Richard Chizmar, who has edited and published some chilling anthologies under the titles SHIVERS I, II, III, and IV, featuring tales by top names in the genre, top names who know a thing or two about scaring people. 

CEMETERY DANCE magazine not only inspires "the creeps" in this reader, but also keeps me informed about new book releases, and other magazines in the genre. If you like your horror ranging anywhere from gonzo to literate, you will like CEMETERY DANCE magazine.

Each issue piles on the terror. Don't read this late at night! What I truly enjoy is the variety of stories. It's not just for horror fans, folks. Some of these tales are suspenseful and others just leave you sitting there thinking, "What the f*%K? That did not just happen!"  
I have a lifetime subscription so I guess that means I'm takin' it to the grave.......and they'll still deliver!!!

Esquire has gone through a lot of changes over the years. It went from a old style GQ clone to a magazine that has broadened its writing, reach, and content. Esquire now occupies a unique nitch in the world of men's magazines. It offers intelligent, thoughtful commentary on life, music, movies and celebrity, occasionally good fiction, good advice columns, a special but brief look at an extraordinary woman in each issue, and heartfelt stories on real issues that affect men, like an author detailing his battle with cancer. Another big bonus, Esquire is not oversaturated with advertisements when compared to GQ and other similar magazines. By comparison to some, Esquire is about 1/3 the size for the same content.

Esquire also annually publishes the world's sexiest woman issue. Entertaining and well photographed, it sets Esquire apart because they also chose to celebrate the beauty of women in their 30s, 40s and 50s, rather than concentrate on the month's latest piece of starlet fluff. 

At under a dollar an issue, Esquire is one of the best deals in town, and is the perfect non-expensive gift for someone in your life Most magazine subscriptions end up costing you an arm and a leg, but this price is well worth the content.

I will always subscribe to this fabulous magazine.   There is so much variety in each issue.  I am amazed at how this magazine always get me interested in things that I have never even thought about before.  And the way the articles are written, I feel like I am being entertained while I am being informed -- it's awesome!  The mix is not just heavy subjects either -- there are always ighter-weight articles too, so I can pick up this magazine on any occasion when I'm in any mood and I can always find something that I want to read about

This is an excellent magazine. There are very few magazines that I choose to read cover to cover. This is one of the few.

The photographs illustrate the text and accompany it just right. They are gorgeous. 

The writing is clear and concise and interesting. The topics they write on include history, travel, historical objects, animals, places and so on. 

One monthly article that has fast become my favorite is about photographers. Each month they highlight a famous picture and the photographer who took it and discuss what made that picture 
important. They tell a little bit about the photographer and the person who was photographed (if it is a person). 

This is a fascinating magazine and well worth the money. Enjoy.

Smithsonian says it like it was, albeit short and sweet.  Without sprinkling complex grammar and cute expressions that are the hallmark of so many publications, Smithsonian provides the latest meaningful scholarship, especially if it departs from traditional concepts.  Their photos are always profoundly informative and fresh, without cut and paste from the time-honored sources.  Their article on Gavrilo Princip, the assassin of Archduke Francis Ferdinand, shook me to the core.  Thanks Smithsonian.

This is the best fashion magazine on the market.  Very realistic with budgets too.  It shows different ways in which everyone can be fashionable (on any budget).  I also enjoy the beauty articles because they have original ideas to stay in style and keep your skin looking beaufiful

most of the beautiful gardens I see are in Washington or Oregon or back east somewhere.  Having lived in Washington, I do enjoy seeing some of the plants that I am missing here in Colorado, but it would be nice to see a more varied selction of gardens becasue we all can't live in the Pacific Northwest.  I have a subscription to Sunset so I guess that will have to suffice, but I do wish BH&G would take that into consideration.

Otherwise, I LOVE this magazine.  I used to get several magazines, but this was always my favorite.  It is chock full of ideas that we can really use.  And I love the photography.  What sets BH&G apart is that you can see a hint of life in these beautiful houses.  Slippers on the floor, newspaper on the table and often the owners of the home are in the pictures too.  They are sometimes blurred from movement which is actually nicer than a posed shot.  It helps set the feeling that this home is lived in and is attainable.  

I would say get this magazine right away.  I would have given it 5 stars except for the whole garden thing.

This is an excellent magazine about American History.  The magazine provides a wide range of stories on a bi-monthly basis.  It doesn't repeat the same stories that most people know but it tries to tell instances that are not as well-known.  In some cases it is little known stories about significant events and other times they have stories about little known pieces of American History.  I only wish the magazine had a monthly publication

This is perhaps my favorite Photography magazine. The printing is fantastic as is the subject matter. I really like the fact there are no ads in it at all. So many photography mags are just an extended catalog for B&H or Adorama that this is a breath of fresh air.

The photography itself is second to none. Always something interesting and fresh

There's a lot to like about Lenswork - the selection of images, the quality of the printing, Bill Jay's "End Notes" - but the thing I like the most is that there is almost no discussion of equipment.  Brooks Jensen (the editor/publisher) doesn't appear to care what camera you used to make a photograph, or how many miles through a raging blizzard you hiked to make it.  All that matters is the image.  And after you've finished looking at the images, you'll find a lot of wisdom and practical information packed into each issue, too.

Highly Recommended

   This magazine is ill!  I learn about all the new albums coming out, read the review,and if they say they are good, i go out  and buy 'em.  The reviews are also accurate, giving the appropiate number of stars.   I also love the sections on the new artists on the verge.  The cover stories never seem to dis-please me, always givin' me plent of info.  The mini articles are cool, too, from stuff like Warren's Sapp's all-star football team, to all about how Mike Jones was discovered.  One last thing I love about the magazine - they are never thin issues, and you know what that means!!!

My son has loved this magazine and is in his third year as a subscriber.  He loves getting an interesting magazine in the mail each month.  I love that it has good emergent reader level content this is focused so that different bits of content throughout the magazine reinforce the same concepts.  My son especially loves the mini-books that come in each magazine and we generally have to make those as soon as they come.

As an educator, I love that the content is at the right level and that it is actually educational in contrast to some magazines.  This magazine is reasonably priced and still has NO advertising.  I am so thankful that the publishers have made that decision and I will keep subscribing to this until it is time to move up to Ranger Rick.  

I did have to sort out a problem with the publisher because we had recieved two gift subscriptions.  I called and they were able to make the two subscriptions run back to back, so instead of two magazines each month, we have two years of subscription and they assure me that whenever it is time to move to Ranger Rick, we can apply any unused Big Backyard to the Ranger Rick subscription.  They were very polite to me and solved my problem efficiently

Of the Big 3 (FORTUNE, Forbes, and BusinessWeek), I like FORTUNE the most.  BusinessWeek feels like it's always copying someone or dying to jump on the bandwagon for the next big thing.  Forbes is a good magazine but sometimes is so original that it veers too far from its original purpose---to report and analyze the business world.
FORTUNE profiles the people it chooses and writes about current events without just summarizing the way BusinessWeek does

Yes, the magazine is great...  but up to 1/3 of the pages are ads.  They will shamelessly load you up with renewal letters.  And occasionally, you get a big stinky AOL disk in with your issue.  Kinda like someone dooking in your cheerios.  Welcome to the mainstream media

This magazine is... well... sweet. I love it. I picked up a subscription in January and i think it's great. They get previews on a ton of games, even those that aren't that gossiped about. They bring a vieraty in opinions when it comes to there reviews. They get a scoped up article on new games very fast. They're not centered on only the good games, but they also include a "shame of the month" (lowest scoring game of the month) award. They include three scores from a scale of 1-10 and the reviewers simply put out the truth and down right say that a game sucks. They have full coverage on new platforms and games. They also include posters and stragety guides with some of their issuses. This magazine is alot better than the Dragonball Z obssessed, GamePro. Its fast and relibel. Definetly a great buy.

I highly recommend Highlights for children. It's a great way for children to begin reading in a very fun way. Watch your child's eyes read with delight as they have fun with puzzles, hidden pictures, games, and fun and entertaining stories.

I have been subscribing to Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine for many years.  I find it an excellent periodical.  The genres range from humor, cosies, hard-boiled detectives, to locked room puzzles, with an added dessert of a &quot;Mystery Classic&quot; at the end of every issue, some dating from the 19th century.   I especially enjoy the absence of gore. The stories are just the right length to satisfy your &quot;mystery craving&quot; before bedtime.  Another kudo:  the AHMM is notably hospitable to aspiring short story mystery authors

Intermezzo is, without question, my very favorite magazine. I think it's the best magazine on the market; most beautiful, most interesting, and has the best recipes. Have already made several recipes from the new issue and they are phenomenal, and pretty simple too. Particularly loved the pear nectar punch which I served at my Christmas party, as well as the saffron chicken which I have already made 3 times. I used to alternate subscribing to Bon Appetit and Gourmet but have let those lapse. Have given it as a gift to several friends who love it as well. Any time I have had a change of address or customer service question, I have been pleased and astonished with the personal and prompt attention of the staff, even once the publisher heself. I think Intermezzo is a small company putting out a world class publication. I do wish it came out more often though as I would love to see more of it.

As your grandfather told you, you can't always judge a book by its cover. Nor, these days, does the title of a magazine always clue you into the content that begins on page three.

Refreshing, then, to page through an issue of CAR AND DRIVER and find that --still crazy after all these years--it's *still* about cars and drivers.

Don't get me wrong; the usual suspects do appear month after month in columns that dig into one aspect or another of the auto industry. And there are those ubiquitous pages of ads from the major auto producers and the after-market confectioners of shiny things to bolt onto them.

But everything else is about cars and the people who drive them. To be slightly more accurate: about cars, written by and for the people who drive them.

A fair number of pages are given over to the exotic and performo varieties of the four-wheeled and the fast. But CAR AND DRIVER displays no embarrassment about majoring on the cars that the rest of us drive. Or might drive or might choose never to drive, given due attention to the reviews put into the hands of drivers like this reviewer by drivers who drive for a living.

'Wanna' know what Madonna drives? Buy another magazine.

'Wanna' know what's new in the '07 Chevies, Fords, and Bimmers?  That would be CAR AND DRIVER

I came across "Olive" when I was in London this past May (2005).  It was a free supplement to that month's issue of "BBC Good Homes", so I wasn't expecting much originally.  Am I ever glad I didn't just toss it in the bin as I would normally do!

"Olive" is devoted to cooking that is, as my title suggests, simple, elegant and healthy.  Great editorial photography makes that food look great, and all its' recipes use readily available ingredients.  Each recipe is short, telling you what you need and how to prepare it, and not much more.  Sidebars or runners at the bottom of the page contain info related to the recipes, such as how to cook the perfect steak (i.e., "bring the steak to room temperature; use a very hot pan" and "oil the meat not the pan").  Under the section "Fast Food", one of these recipes was for Mini Wellingtons, has only 5 ingredients and is ready in 30 minutes.  Another section details how to make a signature Nobu (the famed sushi restaurant in NYC & London) dish, Cod with Miso, and the recipe isn't at all intimidating (although obtaining some of this dish's ingredients might be difficult unless you have access to an Asian market or similar online site).  GI Diet followers can also benefit from "Olive" as nearly all the recipes contain GI-related nutritional information.  Chef Gordon Ramsay also edits a column and shares his favorite tips and recipes.

The only reason I give "Olive" 4 stars instead of 5 is because many recipes contain both metric and imperial measures.  However, conversion info for the metric measures is easily available online.  "Olive" also uses British stove/oven indications, such as "heat the oven too 200C/fan 180/Gas 6" but I was easily able to convert these to Fahrenheit.  

So why subscribe to "Olive" instead of an American cooking magazine?  If you are like me, American Cooking magazines can be frustrating, in that recipes are often (and unneccessarily, IMO) complicated, and better suited to those who cook for the purpose of entertaining large groups of people.  Many healthy cooking magazines don't contain GI Index info, and fail to present it in an easily understood way.  Many cooking magazines 'on this side of the pond' also are chock-full of ads, and you have to get through them before you can get to the recipes or information that prompted you to buy the mag in the first place.  "Olive" is clean, uncluttered, and appeallingly presented.  What's not to like?

I've been a subscriber of E Magazine (which stands for The Environmental Magazine) for over a year now and I love it. It is, by far, the best environmentally oriented magazine I've come across. All of the ads are for environmentally-friendly companies and products, I now purchase products at at least 50% of the places advertised in this magazine. E Magazine covers topics all over the world, including global warming, horse meat (popular in Europe), whaling, deforestation, etc. If you are concerned or interested in environmental issues, I would highly recommend a subscription to this magazine. The issues are bi-monthly but are absolutely action-packed and fact-filled. Subscribe today

I use this magazine for my three kids (ages 9, 11, and 13) who are homeschooled. They love the magazine because it makes history more fun than dry textbooks and they get to really experience what life was like in a certain era. 

Each article includes discussion questions, activities, movies, web sites and additional books to read. What is so great about this is that when one of the kids is really interested in something, they can jump off and explore more on their own - perfect for self-directed learning. And it saves me time in tracking down this stuff.

Some of the more memorable articles were ones like "How to Storm a Castle", "Hobo Signs in the Depression", "Success in Ancient China" and "How Chocolate Conquered Europe" - definitely not standard-fare topics, but fun nonetheless. My kids are getting hooked on history as a result! Sure, it's $5 per issue, but it's pretty thick (60+ pages) and has no ads. You can check out a sample issue online on their web site to see if it is right for your kids

When I picked up a recent issue of Natural Home, I was pleasantly surprised.  I enjoyed the magazine so very much! If you get a chance to flip through it, and want validation for your salvage instincts AND your love of great design ....you may find it just as inspirational.

From the article about adding pretty (and smart) shutters to the interior of a home for cold winter nights (they go under the window treatment and help increase the R-ratings for insulating any window against the cold--this technique has been used in other countries for centuries); the use of ventilation and healthy air is already an obsession of mine; and getting rid of clutter by thinking about things we own and the spaces we put them in a new way was refreshing. "Try this project" appeals to the "use it, don't just throw it away!" girl in me. 

Finally, designing the structure of a house around its usability is something that I really like. There is so much wasted space in today's new construction...I really don't understand it.  Natural Home challenges you to create something new out of what you already have...a breathe of fresh air

I was really pleased when I recieved my first issue. I wasn't sure what to expect from this magazine, but it was wonderful. The design and layout are so much more interesting than other magazines, that alone makes it a joy to look at. The articles are so great, and really offer insight into living a more &quot;natural&quot; lifestyle in the home. I am really happy that someone has put together this resource, because it can be diffucult to find good information on natural products and alternative housing. I was very inspired by the stories about building straw bale homes and can't wait to see more. I wished the magazine was longer so they could show more photos and insights. This is really a great resource for the eco-minded.

I'm a beginner and this magazine came highly recommended by experts at the yarn store.  At first I was amazed at the amount of advertizing.  I enjoy the variety of patterns offered.  It still may be a little too advanced for my stage of knitting when reading pattern instructions.  Overall, I look forward to future issues

Many years ago I subscribed to Bird Talk for my Cockatiel that I had for 25 years. Recently I purchased a new Green Cheek Conure and wanted to learn more information about the caring and raising of a Conure and birds in general. I started last july y subscription to Bird Talk and read everything. It is an excellent source of information for every current and possible new bird owner. Each and very issue is a pleasure to read and I highly recommend it to everyone

What a great magazine - its like receiving a small book of knitting patterns every few months - most of which are totally wearable. I really feel this mag. rides the line between fashionable and practical. I have gotten 4 issues so far and have knit 1 or more items out of each issue. The directions could use a bit more description - sometimes the designers think you can read their minds, but nothing a trip to the geniuses at the yarn store won't fix. There are also interesting articles about things like merino sheep - something you wouldn't think was interesting, but then you start reading it and can't put it down. 
Love the book reviews and ads - I ordered a DVD from one of the ads and am so, so happy with it. I also bought a book after reading the review and have been enjoying it.
Keep in mind that these are "fashion models" and really try to picture your body in the item before you go spending a lot of time on a fitted tank that will make you look massive.
I got this as a gift and will definitely be renewing my subscription when it ends.

This is what I use when I want to knit something for myself.  The patterns are hip and young and they always feature the latest greatest designers.  This is also much more about fashion than any other knitting magazine out there- lots of runway pictures and rail-thin models posing knitwear in exotic locations.  I find that each issue has a good mix of projects of varying skill levels.  I have knitted several and I'm happy with the instructions and I've never run across any major pattern mistakes.  I find that the exact yarns, however, can be hard to find.  They usually give you enough information about the yarn and desired effect so that you can easily substitute.  While I'm careful not to pick patterns that won't be embarrasing to wear next year, they do have a lot of hyper-trendy patterns.  It would be a pity to waste all that time and money on something that would be decidedly "out" by the time you finsih it.

I have been a long time subscriber to Vogue Knitting, it was one of the few US knitting magazines that had really fashionable knitting patterns. I am from Germany, where there are lots of knitting magazines with really chic patterns, I missed that when I moved to the US. However, I find that the content in Vogue Knitting really fluctuated - sometimes it was packed with great designs, sometimes, it was just too far out and there wasn't a single pattern I wanted to knit. I stopped my subscription for a while. Then the editor changed and now the magazine is somewhere in the middle - not too funky, yet still chic and fun. I still enjoy reading it every once in a while. 

After having my daughter, I changed my subscription to Family Circle Easy Knitting, since Vogue Knitting does not carry any patterns for babies or kids, which I really find a shame. I even wrote a letter to the editor saying that this was a major omission. Especially because it is very hard to find chic and elegant kids knits in magazines - not those acrylic yarn patterns with bears on them! The German magazines do a great job of having some unique, but still fun kids designs. 

If you want a very trendy knitting magazine that uses a whole range of yarns (some very expensive), then Vogue Knitting is the magazine for you. If you are looking for elegant knits that are more functional, but still challenging, I would suggest Interweave Knits and Rebecca (English version of a German magazine), both carry some really interesting and challenging patterns. If you have kids, there isn't much out there, I would suggest Family Circle Easy Knitting, also Rebecca does a kids issue once a year, which should not be missed

National Geographic Traveler brings content rich information about the locations covered, the culture of the people, places to stay for many budgets, along with breathtaking photography that makes me want to leap right into the pages. 

National Geographic also has excellent travel packages (I prefer land, no cruises for me) to destinations rich in archeology, history, ancient culture, as well as newer destinations with respect to where to stay. 

If you love seeing the beauty of our planet, this great magazine will definitely help you make your decisions a lot easier!

I subscribed to this magazine at the same time as the Conte Nast
Traveler, and I'm going to keep this subscription and let the other one expire.  This magazine has articles about places not about (as one other reviewer wrote) articles about martinis, fashion etc.
It also has a lot less advertisements and when there are ads they are relevant more to travelers.  It probably all boils down to what kind of travel you prefer to do and read about but for me this magazine is my preferred one

GOLF DIGEST is the big daddy of a well-populated family of golf publications. It's self-styled tag line--'The #1 Golf Publication'--is well-earned.

Where other weeklies report the golfing *news*, GOLF DIGEST is a monthly celebration of golf as life, or at least of the golfing life. It's golf-star-celebrity-packed articles tend to wear titles in the imperative ('Don't Stretch Your Wedges'), giving the sense that the golf world is populated by feverish self-improvers.

Even those of us who are less than bent on links glory, the photography of this publication looks extraordinary. This aspect reaches its zenith during the magazine's frequent published admirations of the finer courses around the world.

No doubt about it, GOLF DIGEST is a lifestyle magazine as much as anything else. Yet the semi- to really-serious golfer will find its pages rich with suggestions on improving his or her game.

GOLF DIGEST anchors the world of English-language golfing publications. Even better, you can frequently pick it up for the price of a few frequent flyer miles

I love this magazine, and am on my third year.  The recipes are interesting, healthy and easy to make after a day at work.  They don't use fake ingredients, which was my complaint with Cooking Light - I'd rather use real yougurt than fake sour cream for instance.  And the recipes don't take all day and 24/7 access to a gourmet supermarket like the ones in Gourmet.  The nutrition articles are interesting and walk a sensible middle line between the low fat and the low carb camps.  Real food for real life

Simply put, this is a great magazine! I have been a continuous subscriber for the last five years, and Country Gardens always deliver.  The lay out is easy to follow and is NOT overridden with advertisement.  The articles are quite enjoyable and informative.  Of course there are plenty of gorgeous photos to suppliment the articles.  God, I love that!
I too wish that this was a monthly publication. However, I will not complain. I don't want to see a good thing ruined.  So, I simply look forward to each issue and settling down for some great gardening articles, diagrams, advice and photos. 
Hats off to the Meredith Corporation for their consistency in excellence! This magazine continues to give. Go on, get yourself a subscription! You will love it! FIVE stars all the way

I really love the fact that there are NO ADVERTISMENTS - just lots of helpful information with a very easy and relaxing layout - it has a very neighborly feel to it.
Also - since it only comes bi-monthly, there is just enough time between issues to look forward to the next

I have been knitting for 25 years and have a HUGE stash of mags, books and yarn. These mags are always at the top of the pile. Beautiful photos, easy directions and patterns you will find no where else. My favorite to date is the stuffed hedgehog in his bathrobe (you have got to see it!)and the knitted nativity scene. Tell me where else could you get that!

This is one of the many different magazines that you can find at discount or grocery stores with lots of hairstyle pictures. They are usually seasonal meaning 4-5 issues a year. This particular magazine is mostly black & white pictures. At least the issues I've bought were. This is something you would buy if you wanted a new hairstyle that would involve a new cut. A majority of the styles in these magazines are shoulder length styles and above. This is a nice item to have in a hair salon for clients to get ideas while they wait

Wonderful cycling magazine for everyday riders.  The content is very well rounded covering racing, touring, commuting, recreational cycling, and mountain biking.  This magazine doesn't just focus on how to make you faster or how to get you to buy the newest/greatest/lightest $8000 carbon bike.  Most of the equipment the magazine tests is geared for regular folks who can afford reasonable prices.  The only problem I have is the price in the U.S

This is one of the best home dcor magazines around today, and by far the best in the Australian market.  Vogue Living is always a great read, and is always full of beautiful and inspiring photographs.  It regularly shows some of the most beautiful homes in Australia, and around the world.  So, if you're interested in Australian style, or just love looking at inspirational interiors, then Vogue Living is for you.  I never throw a copy away

I LOVE Vogue living from Australia. I don't know what it is about countries outside of the US but their design sense is more pure and absolutely more creative. This magazine rings all the right bells with me and I have never throw a copy away. If you crave style that is different from every other magazine that is sold on the mainland US I would say spring the extra couple bucks for this gem

My impression of mainstream American food magazine is that they focus on mostly hearty meals and thick, dense, and rich desserts, which is not what Ij'd like to include in my diet.  Delicious magazine is different, it has a lot of refreshing and light dishes.  It is more expensive then the other magazines probably because it's being imported and printed in Australia (instead of printed in China like other books nowadays).  

You should try to see if your local bookseller carries it because the cover price is only US$8.99 per issue/month.  When I am writing this review, Amazon is selling it for US$126 for 11 issues.  You do the math ;

This is one of the bibles for anyone in graphic design, advertising, illustration or photograhy. It digs deep into industry trends, features portfolios of upcoming industry stars, and is a must for anyone who takes their craft seriously. While the issues are great, their Regional Design Annual is the must-buy issue every year. It really lets you know who the cream of the crop are. Just flipping through it will make you better at what you do (and you'll even stop using hackneyed phrases like &quot;cream of the crop&quot;)

I have to admit I enjoy reading about woodworking almost as much as doing it - just remember I did say "almost"!  

This magazine is among my top five favorite magazines on the topic and I have to say that I enjoy it greatly.  The articles are well written and the photography is very good, which when combined equates to my clear understanding of their project plans, etc.  This is of course crucial for any how-to magazine and there are few disappointments here.  I find that there is almost always one project in every issue that I make plans to build "someday".  Though I don't get to all of them, it is nice to have so many projects to choose from!

I also really appreciate the tool reviews.  Between Popular Woodworking and my other four favorites (Fine Woodworking, Wood, American Woodworker, and Workbench) nearly every type of woodworking tool is reviewed at least once every 18 months.

Overall, this is a solid magazine with good content and a clear purpose and I feel it is well worth the money.

Imagine FX is by far the most detailed magazine that I have seen that is completely loyal and devoted to Scifi and Fantasy Digital Art. Whether your a technician or an admirer, this book oozez with talent and technique. The magazine is not a pro's only book and they take a hands on approach to helping amateurs. None of the writers seem full of themselves. They all know they are in a liquid world of a digital medium where everyone learns from everyone. I highly recommend this magazine. It's more than average price tag is worth every penny, especially when every magazine comes packaged with a disc choc-full of demos, tutorials, photoshop brushes and source art. There is no other experience that comes near the likes of Imagine FX

I am a regular U.S. reader of other Future Publishing art titles, and was overjoyed to see the first title on the newsstand of this fantastic magazine.

ImagineFX explores the digital science fiction, fantasy and anime genres through letters, interviews, portfolio expositions and fantastic tutorials. All issues also include pull-out artwork by the featured artist, as well as a companion DVD featuring files for the tutorials, artwork and software. Within the magazines pages one will find a wide assortment of styles and artists, including everything from tutorials by noted conceptual artist Ryan Church to explorations of gothic art by several fantastic artists which all serve to expand your creativity and help you along your own creative path.

On the minus side, most of us U.S. readers will be put off by the per-issue pricetag. But for those living in the U.K. (lucky!) or those U.S. readers willing and able to part with the money, this magazine is not to be missed

Golfers share many things in common and one of these is an often fanatical love for the game. For these types, nothing can take the place of heading to the nearest golf course, but Golf Digest comes very close. This magazine contains over 200 pages each month, dedicated exclusively to the sport of golf. 

The things that set Golf Digest apart from the competition are the numerous articles about learning and improving your game and the personal stories and interviews. Other golfing publications attempt to help you learn, but they often get too mechanical. Golf Digest shows you how to improve your game with tips from professionals, including some of the star- studded members of the golfing elite like Tiger Woods. 

Besides all the tips and tricks, Golf Digest also shows the personal side of the sport with interviews and more intimate stories about the many colorful personalities in the game. This personal dimension adds greatly to the magazine's overall appeal, providing great reading material to complement the more instructional side of the magazine. 

Golfing Digest may not be as great as a day spent on your favorite golf course, but it comes close. I consider it the best publication of its kind and I recommend it to anyone with an interest in the game.

Running Times, true to its roots, is focused on performance. Worth the price alone for Pete Pfitzinger's Lab Report series and the Owner's Manual sections. If you want to be a better runner at any level, this magazine is invaluable. If you want to understand physiology and kinesiology, you'll find no other resource like Running Times. And if you are interested in the sport of running, the stats and biographies are crucial and are a much needed spotlight on our sport's heroes. Like a true athlete, Running Times eschews junk and filler for focus

I ordered this magazne when my daughter was between 8-11.  The whole family enjoyed the informative issues.  My daughter is in high school now, so we no longer get the magazine.  When my 2 young kids are around 8 or so, I can't wait to order the magazine again.  Detailed photos along with the articles make it very attractive to students.  I never had any billing issues and highly recommend this magazine

Beautifully done, Kids Discover issues are packed with information on one specific subject (ie: volcanoes, the Civil War...). My daughter is 8 and a good student. She uses these magazines as reference texts more than as casual reading material. I think these magazines would be enjoyed most by parents and students between the ages of 10 to 14.

Motor Trend never fails to deliver. I like the fact that they cover such a wide variety of vehicles, everything from SUVs, CUVs, trucks, sportscars, import "tuners", sub-compacts, high-priced exotics, concepts and rumors. The news is fresh and accurate, the issues arrive on time, the mags are thick, pics are crisp, letters are interesting and articles provide usefull information

If you are into cars or know of someone who is than this magazine should make you or them happy. Lots of cool pratical information and pictures for when you are in the market or just want to see what is hot and why. Besides reviews and ratings for most consumer friendly autos there are nice features on those dream-mobiles that most of us only fantasize about. There are also nice articles on auto shows, a section called  Trends where gossip aand opinions blend to pique your interest.  There is  usually an interview with some automobile innovator or mainstay too. The breakdown of an autos profile is helpful if you are shopping for a new vechicle or you just like to compare what is out there. Even if you are not in the market it is an entertaining magazine for browsing. The featured concept cars , which often never get into production or limited production are worth checking out since most of us will never see one,  let alone own one. A pretty good magazine for the car lover in your family

I ordered this on May 5th for Mother's Day, and was advised that the actual subscription may take 6-8 weeks, but that a card would be mailed to my Mother within 3 days.  It was not mailed until June 27th, she still does not believe I was thinking of her on Mother's Day.  As of June 30, she still has not received her first magazine either.  Allow extra time when ordering if it is for a timely item

Based on negative reviews, either I've been knitting too long to still have good sense, or completely in the dark when it comes to this magazine. It is my favorite, and I do not always follow patterns exactly but use ideas in my own sweaters. I found about 6 cardigans in just the last 2-3 issues (a reviewer didn't find any in a couple years of issues). Re Zimmerman-type designs, you can make any sweater in one or two pieces, change gauge, needle sizes, yarns, etc. Search Websites to give you the basics for free. After 2 years of crochet, I learned to knit at age 8 with 2 pencils for needles, found that quad-ruled pads were great to chart patterns whether plain, fancy, Aran, Jacquard, sideways or you-name-it. I like Knit 'N Style. Thanks for reading this

For those of us who miss being in the center of the universe, reading the Observer is almost like being there. In its pink pages I can read stories about New York's political, arts, society, finance, sex and gossip scene.  I can smell the inside of a taxi from my house overlooking the lake in Vermont

I began reading The Green Guide about a year ago and it's one of the best resources out there.  They cover a wide variety of topics and offer actual steps you can take towards a "greener," healthier life.  One of my favorite issues is the one about which ingredients to avoid in cosmetics. Also, I just bought a house and their issue one eco-renovation is extremely helpful.  Not only do they tell you which products are safest, but they also list places where you can actually purchase them!  Their website, [. . .] also has a ton of great information, including charts on which fish, beef, chicken and eggs are safest to buy. I printed them out and carry them with me whenever I go to the supermarket or restaurants

As a library administrator I get to see and read an awful lot of woodworking books and magazines.  I have been a personal subscriber to Woodworker's Journal for a year now, and an off and on reader of the magazine for about 5 years.  In that time I have grown to appreciate this as a very good woodworking magazine.  Is it my favorite?  No, but I still like it well enough to recommend it to others.  I also regularly read Fine Woodworking, Workbench, Wood, Popular Woodworking, etc. and like all of those, this magazine has its strengths.  I find that WJ is very into power tools, tool reviews (theirs are among my favorites), and shop projects.  Having said all of that, I also must confess that the best piece of furniture I ever built came from a plan in WJ magazine (an arts & crafts style wine storage table), so don't pigeon-hole it too much.

Try it for a year and I bet you won't be sorry!

There are two good ways to tell what audience at which a woodworking magazine is aimed.  The first is the type of advertising, and the second is how much skill do the projects expect you to have.  It is pretty clear right away that Woodworker's journal server home woodworkers who are already of moderate skill.  The advertised 'big toys' run in the 500 to 1500 dollar range, although there are a couple of high end combination machines in the adds as well.  

Articles expect you to know how to use the tools of the trade but not sure about the 'best' way to do something.  A recent issue makes a study of an intarsia backed high chair with some interesting joinery, and instructions for making a genuinely exotic angle jig for a table saw.  Writing is solid and reasonably illustrated, but they devote little space to what you should already know, which can make these projects a stretch for a tyro.

The Magazine is very tool oriented.  There isn't a lot of space devoted to hand tools or history.  Expect articles comparing nail guns and helping you decide whether stationary or bench top equipment is right for you.  However, traditionally manual tasks like finishing also receive their due.  I found the Woodworker's Journal suited me quite well, and I expect to continue reading it

I subscribe to several woodworking magazines and have subscribed to Woodworkers Journal since 1990.  Each magazine has a character of it's own with a woodworking level reflected in the complexity of the projects it presents.  This magazine is a bit more complex than, say Wood magazine.  It should be understood that some style and esthetics are usually compromised when a project is simplified.  I have one of Woodworking Journal's projects in my living room.  It is perhaps the most beautiful piece I have ever made.  If you have become an advanced amature (sp?) this magazine will give you projects that you will take pride in making and showing to others

This is one of the many different magazines that you can find at discount or grocery stores with lots of hairstyle pictures. This particular magazine is about 60% color pictures. At least the issues I've bought were. This is something you would buy if you wanted a new hairstyle that would involve a new cut. A majority of the styles in these magazines are shoulder length styles and above. This is a nice item to have in a hair salon for clients to get ideas while they wait. Since this magazine is pictures of Celebrities you can also use it to keep track of their hairstyle changes

I agree that this magazine boasts designer clothing with extremely high prices that most people cannot afford, but may people be aware that this magazine is called "Teen Vogue" and obviously will follow in it's big sister's footsteps. 
"Vogue" does not feature clothes from Walmart, and so "Teen Vogue" will not either.
This magazine does not necessarily cater to only rich people. who says that a person should only buy a magazine when she is going to get the exact clothes featured in it? I am definitely no millionaire. I'm 16 years old and still in High school, but I enjoy this magazine immensely.Of course I dont slip out to Marc Jacobs when i'm done reading and get myself the shirt on page 79, but I do look at the styles so i can understand the new trends and just inspire myself some. magazines dont always have to be realistic. fashion is about pursuing beauty and covetting beauty, and if all magazines only featured "affordable clothes' from Walmart and Old Navy, well.. I really wouldnt know what that would be like.
"Teen Vogue" is a pure fashion magazine. it isnt an all-round magazine for young girls. it's only fashion. and it does a great job at what it strives for. the fashion is great and the taste is great, the shoots are amazing. a former reviewer reccomended "Seventeen" and I want to note that "Seventeen" is a different type of magazine entirely. Seventeen is extremely mainstream bubblegum and is not very fashion orientated. personally i do not like that magazine but i'm not going to condemn it here. 
"Teen Vogue" is classy, stylish, and lives up to it's name. you dont have to be a rich kid to read this magazine. but it's the only teen magazine out there which is dedicated souly to high fashion and yes, features the best fashion.  people who are not interested in fashion will probably hate this magazine, and that is probably why it has recieved so much criticism. I, on the other hand, love this magazine. the only reason i didnt give it five stars is because the reviews above deemed the stuff in it affordable for young girls and that does strike me as ridiculous.
otherwise, look to this magazine for some fantastic fashion inspiration

At least as far as the magazine itself is concerned, but Cardplayer is a vastly superior website with up to the minute tournament coverage, email, and a ton of other things. All In online is definitely worth checking out on a regular basis, however. I just read two hardcopy issues when I was in Vegas and I liked the features, pro coverage, interviews, and book reviews. Should you be miles from a nearby cardroom and have a jones to advance your knowledge then you can do so rather passively by reading a publication that closely follows the pro game

You can buy a subscription to the bimonthly "Audubon" magazine, but the best way to get it is as a benefit derived from joining the National Audubon Society (currently $35/year).  Conservation is a central theme of this magazine, but it also has lots of gorgeous photographs of sandhill cranes, snowflakes, caribou, and everything else that you might expect from a nature magazine, although the articles tend toward pessimism ('grim realism' some might say.)

There are also lots and lots of ads for people who would like to go eco-touring or birding in exotic locales.  I learned to my dismay that I'm not even classified as a birder because I've never traveled somewhere to see a particular bird.  I'm just a humble birdwatcher who tries to identify the avian species that show up at our feeders (everything from wild turkeys to ruby-throated humming birds.)

On the pessimistic side, the March-April 2005 issue of "Audubon" has warnings about global warming (which might affect the fertility of leopard geckos), Easter ducklings that parents buy for their children, then drop off in the local pond when they get too big (most breeds of domestic ducks and geese can't fly.  Basically the unwanted ducks sit in the pond and starve), the over-harvesting of dead wood in European forests (Bechstein's bat nests in dead wood), and the American eel, which has to run the gauntlet of "bait hunters, turbines, and spillways...in a constant battle to hold its own."

There are some bright spots, too:  the red-tailed hawk known as 'Pale Male' is holding its own in New York City, along with its mate, Lola.  'Freecycling' on the internet has "inspired more than half a million people to keep their junk out of landfills"--I thought this was going to be an article about E-Bay, but 'freecycling' is something different.  It's more of an 'adoption agency' than an auction site.  If you're interested in 'freecycling' your extra firewood or an outdated computer, check out the website at freecycling.org. 

Anyone who is interested in birding, or the state of the world's ecology would do well to join the National Audubon Society.  Your membership fee will help in the fight to protect endangered environments and species, and you'll get this interesting magazine as a side benefit.

Workbench is a magazine aimed at do-it-yourself type people who like to work on their own home improvements and save money in the process. This publication presents dozens of woodworking ideas for home improvement and a few for hobby, with plenty of instructions and diagrams to make sure you get it right. 

Most of Workbench is focused on the exterior of one's home. As you page through an issue, you will notice plenty of articles on building wooden decks, new porches, and other decorative ideas to improve the outside appearance of your residence. There are a few projects for the inside, usually dealing with construction of cabinets, bed frames, and other things. But for the most part, the articles deal with outdoor woodworking tasks. 

I like the photos in this magazine because the projects always look so fancy. They are perfectly constructed, clean, and well- finished and they make you want to get off your booty and start working on your own home. In many cases, the articles in this magazine do tend to make things seem a little too easy when, in reality, these projects can often take many days or even weeks to finish. But the end results are worth it not only from a financial standpoint, but also from the sense of pride you feel from a job well done.

Workbench is a little more expensive than other magazines, but for those who enjoy working with their hands, this publication is worth the cost. With some effort and some good ideas, you can greatly improve your home's appearance and value with some new outdoor trimmings. Workbench shows you exactly how to get the job done with plenty of woodworking projects to enhance your residence inside and out.

Logic problems really helped me prepare for college. Many of my courses required critical thinking and writing. When I first started doing logic problems, I was terrible! They were so hard, but as I practiced, I became adept at solving these problems. I thought of them as "mental push-ups". The effort was worth it! I graduated magna cum laude

Just got this in the mail:  If I allow SI to charge my credit card NOW for a subscription that isn't due to renew until 12/24/2007, they will send me 60 issues for $39.00, or .65 per issue.  I have the right to discontinue this automatic billing at any time.  So there is a very slight savings, somewhat offset by the fact that they will use my $$$ for an extra 9 months or so (recognizing that at the typical bank interest rate of 2%, that interest is worth about 50 cents, so I guess it pushes the per issue rate up to .66)

I've been a subscriber to Outside magazine for several years, and it seems to go through its ups and downs in terms of the strength of its editorial content, especially regarding the political side of environmentalism. It is still easily the most informative magazine out there for lovers of the outdoors, but just note that the focus is on active, not armchair, appreciation of nature. Beyond the occasionally great and always heavily knowledgeable product reviews, the key strength of this magazine is the well-written and strongly researched articles on outdoor issues of concern, not just in America but around the world. An outstanding recent example, among many, concerns the economics of environmentalism in the conservative Western U.S. This is the type of strong conservationist reporting that can usually only be found otherwise in books. Other more whimsical articles are just fun to read for those with off-kilter interests, such as recent pieces on urban rock climbing or sauna fanatics in Finland.

Many other articles could be classified more as travel/tourism than adventure, but the accompanying photography is always top-notch, and the editors have a knack for finding out-of-the-way hidden treasures around the world that are ripe for discovery by the adventurous. (But on the other hand, the magazine could be faulted for contributing to the recent trend of hyping previously unknown outdoor paradises that have since become crowded, such as Molly Sods Wilderness in West Virginia.)  Personally, I would like to see a little less focus on expensive vacations that extreme sports fanatics can take in hard-to-reach nations, and more on what folks with more realistic means (and amounts of free time) can do in humble parks and forests near home. But despite its habit of losing its focus at times, I will continue to be a fan of Outside for years to come, and might just travel to some of those hyped exotic adventure locations. [~doomsdayer520~

My wife loves this magazine so I bought her a one-year (6 issues) subscription through Amazon.com for $25.60.  That turned out to be a foolish and impulsive move on my part when I found out that I could have subscribed directly from Healthy Cooking for $14.95 for one year or $19.95 for two years.  Although I have realized significant reductions on book costs, clearly this magazine subscription is excessively priced.  I will shop more carefully in the future.

I saw this magazine while browsing a local bookstore and it was a magazine that stood out for some reason...I picked it up and flipped through a few pages and came across an article on Maggie Gyllanhall.  I had recently watched &quot;Secretary,&quot; and I liked her, so I bought it.  I'm not much for fashion magazines but this is much different from others like Vogue.  After buying my first Flaunt magazine, I wanted to buy more, but needless to say, the bookstore has not gotten any in for a long time...:(  This magazine will be great for readers who are bored with the same crap churned out in every other magazine out there..

Super Chevy is a on top magazine they keep you well informed on helpful info for building hot engines &amp; doing it with value in mind, they are also helpful with visual pictures in a step by step sequence with many hints that the average person can understand. I also like it when they show different parts &amp; electrical pictures for building a car from start to finish the more information the better, this is true for transmissions &amp; rear ends. Also like all the great hands on how to do it from people in the know, thanks!

Popstar would be a great choice for concerned parents wondering what subscription to get for their ten-year-old kid, because unlike many celebrity news magazines (even more teen-oriented ones), Popstar is most likely the safest one out there. It covers a great deal of celebrities that aren't huge yet, and tons of stuff about favorites like Lindsay Lohan, Hilary Duff, Raven, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, the cast of Harry Potter, Good Charlotte, etc. There are thousands of pinups and huge posters in each issue that will satisfy any music/TV/movie fan. 

Another thing I like about this magazine is that it's legnthy (each issue is 100 pagees), and there aren't any advertisements, either. The magazine has frequent exclusive interviews and pictures with celebrities that can't be found anywhere else. Additionally, Popstar covers the month's best CDs, new artists to watch out for, embarrasing moments stories, horoscopes, a bit of fashion and beauty, and more. For those who want an interesting, informational celeb magazine, Popstar would be a great choice

Had great expectations, for the expensive subscription you get some really great coverage of neat hardware hacking stuff happening out there (and available on the web). The how to make stuff takes many many unnecessary pages, get the feel that they are trying to fill the pages with large photo spreads. Still has a way to go before it becomes a successful combination of Wired magazine, Elektor electronics, and hardware hack websites. Would definitely like more stuff like making an XYZ mill/router instead of a feature on the MIT fab lab. In spite of all the above I have renewed the pricey subscription - am still hoping ...

Casino Player is the end-all magazine for the serious gambler (and the gambler who likes weekend fun with lots of comps!).  It is one of the pricier magazines, but the cost is well worth it, and it isn't over-run with advertising.  

The letters to the editor touch on basic gaming, slot, and comp questions, and I always glean useful information from the Q&A section.  The magazine content covers slot machines, video poker strategy and probability, table game strategy and expected pay-offs, investing in the gaming industry's publicly-held corporations, and reviews of properties, restaurants, and shows.  I always read it before heading to Vegas to learn what is new and happening on the Strip and in the area.

Casino Player provides balanced coverage of Vegas, Atlantic City, Indian properties, and riverboat casinos.  As a Southern CA native, I usually skim features outside Vegas, but the magazine should be commended for reaching out to gamblers in all parts of the country

I used to dream about subscribing to Threads and drool over them in the library, but the new format beginning in Fall 2005 is disappointing.  They have added many more articles of interest to very new sewers such as how to choose the correct needle for a fabric.  This basic info is readily available in many basic sewing books and it is not why I renewed to Threads for another 3 years.  This magazine once showed cutting edge techniques and lots of projects that intermediate and advanced sewers could savor.  As a beginning sewer I used to dream about conquering the exciting projects in Threads.  Now, they have watered it down to appeal to less skilled people at the expense of the projects and information that made it stand out from other sewing magazines.  This is still a "good" magazine, but no longer excellent.  I wish that I could get back my money for the next 3 years and spend it on fabric

From fitting pants to making origami pants, there is always something for the sewer to learn and enjoy. Threads used to have good knitting articles, but decided to abandon the subject to concentrate on sewing. If you are a fashion sewer, this is a must-have

I have been a subscriber to Threads since it's inaugural issue, and have saved every one. The publishers, writers and editors have uncompromising standards for accuracy, originality and inspiration. While the magazine has evolved over the years, and away from accessory crafts such as knitting, it has nevertheless remained the premier publication for fine sewing. Some articles are geared towards the advanced sewers, but many basic techniques and information are shown and explained more clearly, in more easy to understand depth, than any other publication of it's type. The pictures and diagrams are professional and clear. The instructions well written. Even the advertising is worth perusing. Top caliber all around

I ordered back issues of this magazine from an Ebay dealer in the UK after the Spring 2006 issue came out and I am sold not just on Burda Plus but on Berlin fashion designers as well- the women, anyway, make lovely, flowing but not "girly" clothes that are very wearable - Think Eileen Fisher or Flax but with  darker, richer colors, fibers and textures, slightly more "fit" and more interesting shapes in a wider variety -- not just the same few repeated again and again.  Clothes for the decades, not the season -- and the patterns are HERE!  at least some of them, from designers like Evelyn Brandt, Doris Strietch (and another Berliner (female)  whose name escapes me at the moment, but whose clothes I deeply admire.) 
The fit is better than most American pattern companies - especially pants.  If you make one garment from each issue the subscription has more than paid for itself.  Good info on sizing patterns up or down in the back issues I recently received - keeping the proportions if using a "petite" or a "tall" pattern if you are neither. Pattern directions themselves can be less than enlightening, though - perhaps "non-fluent" would be the best description of their translation.  And the breathless tone (LOTS of exclamation points!!!!) of the editorial content seems a bit much for such "smart" clothes, but we're not buying this for the elegancce of the writing!

Another reviewer complained of delivery delay.  This is only published in January and July.  If you missed subscribing in time for the last issue and the print run is gone, you have to wait until the next one pubs.  And the print runs DO sell out.  As I can attest

Contrary to the previous review, the majority of the patterns in the Fall/Winter 2005 issue were normal sizes (5'6").  This particular issue contains 10 jackets (two of which were for petites), four skirts (one of them petite), three pants (one petite), and four shells (two petites).  There were no dresses and no blouses with sleeves.  The interesting fabric choices and the superb fashion photography were also excellent.  This particular issue also had an article on how to change a petite pattern to a regular pattern and vice versa.  The pattern pieces have unique sophisticated shapes, very interesting for the intermediate to advanced sewer.  One thing I did find lacking was there was no casual sportswear.  The magazine seems geared toward business suits and formal occasions.

Science matters. You already know that. You want to stay on top of what's happening in medicine, space research, earth studies, and more. That's because you know things like AIDS, earthquakes, and changing weather patterns all have huge significance to human needs and social policy. But you don't have the time or the specialized knowledge to plow through piles of academic journals every week, hunting the nuggets that mean the most and translating them into the language of normal, educated reader.

You want Science News. It's brief and readable, so you don't have to dedicate half your week to keeping up with what really matters. It's weekly, which matters in a world where month-old news is old news. And it's written so that any concerned citizen can understand the science and the issues. The editors don't write down to the readers, but they don't assume specialized education either. Intelligent high-schoolers or precocious tween-agers can grasp the important parts of each story, but specialists (including one university prof I know) use it to keep up with news outside of their research areas.

Try a few issues at your local library - you'll probably find that you'll want your own.

This is a magazine for Alix Mautner.  Richard Feynman wrote QED, in part, because he wanted to write a series of lectures that would make quantum electrodynamics understandable to his friend, Mautner.  Science News does the same with geology, ecology, medicine, physics, chemistry, and other sciences.  It does it by reviewing, in understandable terms, the theory, the experiments, the conclusions, and the alternative ways to interpret the conclusions.  It projects the cutting edge of science by reviewing not only the published science, but also the science reported in scientific gatherings.  Since the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of the writing is approximately 11, or 1 more than National Geographic, it is perfect for the literate masses from age 13 up.  Today's issue included an article on whether honeybees can discriminate between human faces (really!).  The answer is... usually.  And the cover story was on the chemistry of beer. 

The magazine is published 51 weeks a year, and subscribers also have access to web resources including references, extended articles, and the archive.  Science News is the best thing to happen to current science news reporting since... sliced honey bread, delivered to my face

I absolutely adore Elle Decoration - as several other reviewers have noted, unfortunately, the American version can't compare.  The spaces are gorgeous, and infinitely more imaginative and vivacious.  All of my American magazines (with the exception of Interior Design) get ripped apart, with a few pages pulled out and the rest tossed - Elle Decoration always gets saved in its entirety. I highly recommend - these magazines are eye candy, and they are truly worth the extra cost of an import.

Bell'Italia is an Italian-language magazine that is to be read and savored and then saved for when you actually get to visit the areas described.  The photos and the narratives are excellent and they highlight not just those cities that are famous but those places that many tourists never get to see and that are just as deserving.  Moreover, in the more famous cities like Venice and Florence, the places presented are often those that do not get much notice.  In addition, the magazine highlights those restaurants and events in the area that will make the visit even more exciting.  I have been a faithful subscriber for the past 6 years and never miss an issue

I bought this for my dad for Christmas this year and he loves the idea. Yes, it is taking a while for the first subscription to arrive, but they warned me it would be 6-8 weeks. With the money savings, I didn't mind waiting a bit for the first issue.  They even mailed me a little gift certificate notification card to send to my dad

This is a fantastic magazine. What I really enjoy about it is how often the featured homes are ones with small kids. They show it is possible to have great design that works well with young ones too. It's comfortable, livable modern. Now, if only we could find a way to import the products shown here to the U.S.!

Agree with the other reviewer, nothing like this in the states. No country kitch, no traditional, just straight modern, clean, pretty rooms/homes. It's expensive, that's the part that stinks. I buy it at $7.50 an issue, but it's worth it. B/c it's modern, there is a lot of minimalism, which you very rarely see in U.S. magazines. I keep every copy of this. They are always good for reference, i read them each dozens of times over.

The most amazing thing about American Iron is their tech articles.  Pictures are used to illustrate various steps in a process and, unlike most of the other Harley rags', the photos are crisp and detail the step! They really seem geared to a Joe Average reader who is not milling out the bore of their bike on a regular basis

I have had the subscription for 2.5 years now and I enjoy getting it bimonthly. The recipes often do call for hard to find ingrediants (since I don't live in a real big city) and most of them take alot of prep time and cooking but that's why the magazine is COOKING PLEASURES. It's not Quick 'N Easy. 

I gave the magazine 4 stars instead of 5 because I find that most of the recipes are "pleasurable" in comfort and not calories or fat. I love the desserts and main dishes they usually have, its just that most of the dishes are not good for the waist line. But, I guess that's why its PLEASURES and not LIGHT

 A friend introduced me to this fun magazine.  Without being ponderous, it has more useful and accessible information than I've seen in one food or wine journal in a long time.  I've learned practical things like not to buy the econony sized vermouth, 'cause it won't keep well once opened, or the best sparkling ciders, what wine to bring as a dinner party gift, and why Guinness tastes better in Ireland. It has great virtual trips - like to Thailand, Oaxaco, and Jamaica woven around the theme of the liquid pleasures produced in each country - everything from tea to rum, or chocolate. I find it humanizes the products from all over the world that I take for granted - while giving me imaginative ways to serve them. When CNN starts to drown me with bad news, this snappy mag is as refreshing as Thai iced tea or a tall Vermouth cassis

Unlike many of my friends this was not a traumatic time for me. However it took quite some time before I could read anything about the era. Now that it is so long ago that it is sort of a dream I wonder if I should have kept up with this magazine. 

I now find it intriguing and wish there was more on the area I was in. The major players are displayed but not so much the more personal information. 

Yet I have friends that were in many of the groups depicted in this magazine and it like any other specialty magazine of a time and place can hold special moments for them.

There is also a good magazine for people that missed their chance to take place in Vietnam in that time in history.

As with any experience if you ere not there then you can not know but this comes closest to an objective telling of history. 

Be sure not to overlook the ads as they are an intricate part of the magazine and offer some interesting items.

I've been a faithful subscriber to "America's Civil War" since 1993, and I'd say that it's easily one of the best history-related magazines in existence. I read each issue cover-to-cover, even the letters to the editor. Long after I first started studying the Civil War almost 15 years ago, I'm still learning a lot from this and other magazines like "Civil War Times Illustrated" (which is also great). In each issue of "America's Civil War" you can find a variety of articles in the following categories: personality (which focuses on a specific soldier of officer), eyewitness to war (great first-hand accounts from both soldiers and civilians), men and materiel (weapons and equipment), reviews, commands (focuses on individual units), preservation (of artifacts and historic sites), and of course several articles which can cover a wide range of topics, from battles and leaders to politics and slavery. Although I wish more would be written about the neglected Western Theater, I feel that the articles cover most aspects of the war very well. I love the artwork and outstanding maps that accompany the articles. And, "America's Civil War" is all about pleasing the readers. Back in 1997 I mailed in a questionnaire from "America's Civil War" after writing that my favorite issue had a great article on the famous Irish Brigade. A few months later a new article on the Irish Brigade (by the very same author) appeared in their magazine and I was very impressed by this. Bottom line: if you are a Civil War buff this magazine is just what you need

If you need to keep abreast of financials and business on a monthly basis, Forbes and Fortune are the two conventional choices.

I started reading Fortune - and subscribing - four years ago when I realized that the business people with whom I associated regularly simply assumed that one knew any news or analysis that broke in its pages. It fits as a must-read monthly overview in my reading habits.

Fortune represents a generally bullish and strongly pro-business perspective with just a touch of cynicism about corporate leadership and its trends. You won't find anything radical here, but you need to have read it if this kind of news, analysis, and opinion fits your job description or personal interests.

There is a smattering of 'toys for the businessperson' in each edition. For me, the highlight is Stanley Bing's delicious, irreverent, and every so slightly jaded backpage column.  I routinely scan it or mail it to a relative who laughs out loud at Bing's corporate lunacy as I do.

Fortune is behind the eponymous Fortune 500 and other derivative lists. For me, one of the most valuable is the magazine's annual '500 largest corporations by revenue', though this is dictated by the scope of my own interests. Other readers will tear out or access other Fortune lists online with equal interest.

If you're in business or work with people who are, you'd better be reading Fortune or Forbes or both

"Fortune" is a classic on the newsstand, and is as vital and important today as ever. "Fortune" generally caters to people with a managerial bent, especially upper-level executives, but also offers excellent analysis on current events in the business world, the global and national economic climate, and forward-looking technology and trend information. 

Each issue is normally organized around a theme or major story, like the Enron trial, or the 100 best companies to work for in a given year. I do enjoy the articles where they rank things, but more than the rankings themselves, I am always interested in the justifications they use for their rankings; while I don't always agree with the magazine, I do always find it good food for thought.

The features are generally very polished and accurate, and the lessons are conveyed in a straightforward manner that is as useful to a CEO as to a college business student. I particularly appreciate the interviews that "Fortune" has with key players in the financial industry, and also appreciate the very useful index of companies and individuals featured in every issue. 

The magazine will probably not be the favorite for investing advice because it also covers so much other financial terrain; small investors may also want to read a more specific magazine like "Kiplinger's." Nonetheless, the investment advice and insight "Fortune" offers should generally be held in high esteem. 

I also appreciate the coverage of key trends, and in particular want to note that "Fortune" has been in the lead with excellent reporting on the pension crisis in America: coverage of this sort is what makes me a loyal reader.

Many other financial magazines are available and are competing for your money; while there are several I would recommend, "Fortune" remains a reliable source of information on macro-level trends, and should be a part of everyone's business library

Out of all the magazines I have ever recieved, this is my favorite. The writers and editors have a immense sense of humor and are knowledgable about what they write about. This magazine is creative, funny, and very informative. The articles are very thorough in facts and the writers go to great lengths to write them. Although some people may think that this magazine is for kids; adults enjoy this magazine too! I know, my parents read my magazine almost right after I'm done! They love it! Recently, there was an article about tombs or whatever you call them near Paris. I showed the article to my French teacher and she even learned something new! This magazine should have 10 stars instead of 5!

Muse magazine is in a class by itself. It has NO advertisements, no  articles about how to make yourself prettier or any other boring stuff that shallow teens care about. We musers love the focus on science and math, and they've replaced the original mythological muses with 9 of their own. These little cartoons litter the margins with their witty comments, making the rare tedious article funny. Receiving this magazine is your ticket into the close-knit community of Musers, kids who have openness and learning at the heart of all their doings.

Muse is one of my all-time favorite magazines. I'm 15 (which is above the recommended age) and I STILL enjoy it. One of my favorite activities is learning and my other favorite is reading. With Muse I can do both at once. What more could I ask?

I don't know what that Midwest Educator is on, but I recommend you stay away from it, kids. It can't be good for you if it turns you against Muse

Although the target audience is stated to be 8-12 year old, my seven year old is completely fascinated with this magazine. She has thanked me countless times for the subscription and looks forward to each month with anticipation. Not only are the stories lively and entertaining, they are educational as well (I am also learning various things about history and culture that I did not know before!). There is a good mix of fiction and non fiction stories as well as poetry. Since receiving this magazine, I have noticed her excelling more at reading comprehension and her own story writing skills. These reasons are why I believe it is well worth the money and I wll be renewing our subscription for a very long time.

I got Cricket magazine in the mail when I was young. Years later, it has lost none of its quality. It's full of stories, articles, cartoons, jokes, puzzles. I remember some of the stories to this day. The text is always fun, always informative, never condescending. Difficult words are defined, complex ideas are explained, and the reader is enchanted. The illustrations are beautiful, from many different styles. The stories are from the best writers for children, and they cover all manner of cultures and interests. I can't recommend this magazine highly enough

...once you tear out the subscription cards, there are no ads (unless you count one unobtrusive one buried in the publisher's information, telling you how to renew your subscription or order a slipcase).

Each issue includes a tear-out activity...a craft or game related to that issue's theme.

The cast of characters is fairly diverse with various races represented.  And if you like your child's reading material to be secular, this magazine fits the bill.  

My 4 year old and I look forward to each issue...it's a little expensive for 9 issues, but it's worth it

I've been getting this magazine since it first came out years ago, and every issue is just as exciting as the first. It not only gives you the military aspect of events, but often goes into detail as to how and why these events occured, which is invaluable in itself. I can't wait for the next issue to come out, and wish it would come out more often. And the fact that it comes in hardcover format makes a nice presentation on my bookshelf. Thank you MH

I have been a subscriber for some time. It's a business publication that does not focus solely on Wall Street financials - they are there to a lesser degree but this is not the publication if that is what you are looking for. Think entrepreneur or general business topics and that's Business 2.0. It does not focus on one topic or industry but covers all to some degree - think `oddball' as well. Monthly sections include `What's Next', `What Works', `What's Cool'. The articles are cutting edge in some cases, well researched and well written with an informal slant. They cover tech, marketing, product development, product design, ideas, new products and services, M&A's and a wide range of general business topics. You will find out about new things before most of your coworkers, giving you interesting conversation fodder for the water cooler, happy-hour settings. To go even further in figuring out their demographics and target market/s, the ads include autos like Camry, Land Rover LR3, Mini Cooper and even the Porsche Boxster, Laptops, Business Productivity Software like Office 2003, Business Products like copiers and printers, Mobile calling plans, HP, Credit Cards and even Lufthansa airline. So if you are not in this demographic, maybe they're not targeting your demographic. Why Buy: You are an up and coming business major or business professional in your `building your career foundation' of your career. You are entrepreneurial minded. You want to keep on top of a wide range of business topics and even some that are not yet making the news. As a gift for someone with these interests

Business 2.0 is one of the few business magazines I read on a monthly basis, and just recently extended for another 2 years. One of the most valuable aspects of this magazine is their analysis of the bleeding edge companies - I don't want to limit my reading to case studies and best practices from the biggest, most obviously successful companies. I want to know what the startups are doing, and what the oddball companies with new ideas are doing differently. Not everything is going to apply, but since your own business must constantly evolve, I like a magazine that focuses on the constant changes of a variety of businesses. 

Why four stars? To be honest, when the magazine was purchased by its current parent company a couple years back, I feel the quality took a bit of a hit. I don't care for the new design, though I'm sure it saved a few dollars. And the number/quality of articles also slid a bit. But all in all its still one of the better business magazines out there, and by far the best in the "new economy" sector

This wonderful magazine made me a good cook. Period. Each issue considers upcoming holidays plus what fruits and veggies are in season and provides a ton of new recipes. My family never knows that the recipes are light and I'm actually somewhat happy about sitting down and planning out meals. The recipes are also a mix of complicated and simple, fruit and desert, main dishes and salads. I buy subscriptions as gifts. Plus, there's not one iota of advertising in this beautifully photographed magazine. Refreshing! Mary in P

Internanatial Artists magazine is the best magazine on the shelf bar none.  I've read many other artist magazines time and time again, but haven't found anything that compares to this jewel. It provides great illustrations as well as wonderful perspectives that are enjoyable as well as inspiring for your reading pleasure.  Not only does it inform, it also provides technical and creative details and images in various media for most artist needs in bold beatiful color.  This is a truly a winner

I sew, and I love this magazine. Till recently I had an annual subscription and I need to refresh my subscription again.

Here are some helpful tips on why you might like to subscribe EVEN IF YOU DON'T SEW, and how to do so if you are out of the States area.

For Canadians there is a Burda magazine reseller, and it will cost about 10$ Canadian per issue. Which is MUCH less than a normal pattern now. So it saves you on patterns.

Burda has ways to subscribe for each country, just go to their website and click till you get the reseller for your own area.

WHY BURDA IS THE BEST!
The fashions presented are 2 years ahead. I found that styles presented in Burda were a year ahead of hitting the stores in retail, and 2 to 3 years ahead of the other major pattern companies, and about 1 year ahead of Burda's pattern envelopes sold in the fabric stores.

EVEN IF ALL YOU DO IS LOOK AT UPCOMING STYLES and never sew a stitch you will find this magazine useful to keep ahead of trend curves. 

This is what the European ladies are wearing. 

All clothing is well put together, showing current trends (future trends for north america!) in Europe in shoes, purses, jewelry, colour choices and more. They use fashion forward textiles to make the garments and the photos are clear enough that you can get trim detail and figure out fabric from your local store. 

Looking at their trends page in each issue will give you an idea where things are going in accessories as well as fashion.

If you do sew, this magazine will keep you from wasting money on outdated paper patterns and keep you in the front end of fashion. After all if you go to the trouble of sewing, and fitting it's nice if you can wear something for a few extra years and look up to date while doing so.

Each magazine comes with ALL the patterns in regular sizing to make all the clothing featured. Look thru, see what you like and trace off your own pattern.

A note about sizes --Burda fits much closer than normal pattern companies which makes for a much nicer fit, but you may find yourself needing to go up a size or two. 

Measure carefully, and try cutting one size up till you get used to the fit. Don't cut into expensive fabric till you are used to how they fit. Make a few cheaper garments first. The armholes and the crotch area fit differently than north american clothes.

Plus sizes are not in all the featured clothes, but have a separate plus size section in the magazine. REALLY nice styling for plus sizes too. However be aware that above a size 20/22 in north american sizes, won't fit into these plus sizes. Their idea of plus is 14-20/22.

They have a special Plus size magazine as well as Burda Moden, which is all plus sizes, and it comes out twice a year. I found that to be a useful addition to my regular Burda magazine and the clothing was never duplicated from one to the other.

Children's and Men's outfits are featured in many but not all of the issues.

Here are a couple of helpful hints to dealing with tracing off the patterns in the centerfold. 

I used waxed paper in the usual kitchen type roll and traced with a sharpie marker pen. 

WHY WAX PAPER? It's cheap, you can SEE THRU IT, and you can fuse it into bigger sheets as needed.

FUSING WAX PAPER: take a warm iron, and press thru a paper towel so you don't get wax paper on your iron. (when you finish, run your iron over a clean terry facecloth to absorb any wax that seeped out). When fusing, hold till the wax paper clings and it will look a bit "bubbly".

EDITED TO ADD: USE A HIGHLIGHTER PEN to mark the lines you are tracing off. It will help you "see" the correct pattern peice and the correct size in the spaghetti trail that is the master pattern in the centerfold.

TRACING: Burda patterns DON'T come with a seam allowance so I added that after tracing my patterns. Using a sharpie and a straight edge for long runs I traced off my desired size in the patterns which look like multicoloured spaghetti lines all over the newsprint center. 

About all those lines. Here is where my wax paper tip comes in handy. I've tried tracing paper, even interfacing but the multiple lines on a Burda magazine pattern are too much for those usual tracing papers or interfacing. You will need something much more see thru. Wax paper! cheap, almost transparent, sturdy and won't bleed sharpie marker ink.

Burda doesn't print one sided pattern masters so you HAVE to trace. You can't just sacrifice the rest of the patterns to cut yourself one only since the other peices will likely be printed on the back.

REMEMBER TO ADD YOUR SEAM ALLOWANCE

Once I cut out my pattern (and write all the notes about what size, layout, darts etc on the pattern) I put my pattern pieces in a Manila envelope.

Pattern envelopes for home made patterns work best with some labelling. I put the magazine (june 05) and the page # (34) and the model I'm copying along with the size, the yardage I require and any sewing notions or extras (zippers, interfacing, 17 buttons, yada yada)

Maybe due to being a bit obsessive about such things I sketch a line drawing on the envelope with a note saying, skirt, pants, jacket or whatever the garment is. My drawing isn't perfect but I try to include a front and back view with major seams and darts drawn in. It's useful.

I keep them in a normal household file folder, since the manila envelopes fit perfectly.

File under Jacket, Dress, Skirt etc. or by year.

There, I hope that helps. This is WELL worth getting even if you never sew a single stitch from the magazine.

I've made better gains in 4 magazines of POWERLIFTINGUSA than my 10+ years of Muscle&Fitness & Flex. No more mindless rep after rep of the same exersizes only to show little (if any) gains for your efforts. This is a MUST for those fed up with the 230 page fitness mags with over 200 of them being advertisements being jamed down your throat (no pun intended). If you want to make real gains you can't argue with the methods that are tried & true by those who squat over 1000lbs & bench 800+. I'm pushing more weight than ever & my joint pains are gone now that I'm lifting correctly & not the M&F way. Best weightlifter magazine period. Buy it now.

I've been subscribing to PLUSA since 1984, the same year I started powerlifting. It contains a wealth of information for the beginner to the elite lifter. Interesting strength articles, interviews with the champions of the sport, results from meets, and the list of upcoming contests. It also contains all the different powerlifting vendors for your equipment needs. Its a must to have this magazine for anyone into or starting out with powerlifting. Its the ORIGINAL mag

This is a great magazine with the exception of articles written by Herb Glossberger, who seems to only write articles about the people at LA Lifting Club (where he works out).  If you overlook that aspect, the mag is great.  The knowledge that can be gained simply by reading the articles written by Louie Simmons and Dave Tate.    Well worth it.   It also cannot be purchased in your local magazine store

From cover to cover this magazine is artistically designed and inspired. Everything you expect it to be, it is. Not only do the articles and pictures portray the latest and greatest in fashion and pop culture, but even the ads lead you to the high-end fashionably eclectic such as Oakley Eyewear and Screaming Mimi's. The articles are varied, going from Mandy Moore's new style to the new L.A. African dance trend known as &quot;krumping&quot; (ferocious, free, and performed at breakneck speed), to architectural design so out-of-the-way that it includes a cardboard box house. If you love fashion, the odd, the sensual, the just plain COOL, then subscribe to Paper. I'd buy it for $20

Okay, yeah, it's no "Vogue" or "Cosmo," but "Glamour" is a lot more accessible to the "everyperson" than the other two. Not all of us have glamourous pagegirl jobs that (miraculously) pay six figures. Seriously--secretaries in Prada? As if! So Glamour is a little more realistic, and a little more fun. AND a lot less expensive. It's a fun, "cheap," guilty pleasure

This bimonthly magazine is a wish book for those of us who don't have two full-time gardeners on staff, or a few acres of woods to devote to bluebells, or the ruins of an ancient abbey to train roses against.  My Regency ancestors were breaking their backs on hardscrabble New England farms, rather than building follies or planting mazes, or having their grounds landscaped by Capability Brown.

Oh, but what if....

I've subscribed to "The English Garden" for many years now, and I don't think I've ever gotten anything useful out of it, but the gardens photographed within its glossy pages are to dream for:  acres of blooming rhododendrons; statuesque old sequoias that were planted when Victoria was queen; lavender hedges; outdoor rooms that have been replanted to a 17th century plan; a sundial pool; and of course, a bluebell wood.

There are plenty of suggestions for the serious gardener.  For example, the current issue (July 2005) features the following:

*	For year round colour, buy a couple of peacocks.  Their screams will also scare away the burglars

*	One gentleman favors beer for slugs, "Although I don't dare use it here - the gardeners would drink it!"

*	Hazel twigs bent over beds and urns will deter the peacocks

*	Add a touch of history to your garden with an Italian carved white marble seat.  It can be picked up at Sotheby's Garden Statuary sale for a mere 25,000 - 40,000 pounds.  (I absolutely lust for this bench, but alas my pension must be spent elsewhere)

*	"Use perfumed plants in the conservatory because the warmth generated by the glass pumps fragrance through the house"

*	Plant marigolds in your walled kitchen garden to keep "eelworm and whitefly at bay"

*	Flank the path to the summerhouse with rhododendrons and white narcissi

*	To break up a long path, use arches "lightly clothed with jasmine or clematis"

If some of the above tips are a bit too steep for your pocketbook, you can do like me and drool over the marvelous photographs of someone else's jasmine arch and Italian carved marble.

The magazine has great, quality pictures and some interesting articles.  

The pictures of some golf courses are amazing and very professional.

I love reading this magazine in my spare time.  Yes, the magazine is for golfers who always tended to have higher incomes.  Golf  was always an expensive sport anyway.

For golf instructions, I recommmend                          THE ULIMATE GOLF INSTRUCTION GUIDE: KEY TECHNIQUES FOR BECOMING A ZERO HANDICAP GOLFER OR BETTER.  This is written by Patrick Leonardi

I wanted to share with other readers because this book made my golf game get much better.  If you are like me, I was stuck around the same handicap.  However, this book got me playing much better golf.

For golf equipment, I definitely recommmend PING IRONS.  Great feel and distance with these clubs.  For putters, I also recommend PING.  They are the best.  The ball putts straight and true.   The feel is natural and unforced.

I love evo and buy it every month.  So why don't I get a subscription?  Because it still costs less to buy it at Barnes and Noble than to get a 12 month subscription!  This must be the only magazine that can claim a cheaper in-store price.  What's up with that

This is my favourite car mag out there right now. It exceeds Car by miles in terms of writing quality. I only have to say one thing: It's cheaper to buy this at a local mega bookstore like Boarders than to buy this online. It costs $9.99/issue so a year would cost $120 plus tax. I thought getting a subscription should SAVE YOU MONEY, not make you PAY MORE!!

To those of you who are sceptable concerning British car magazines, as an enthusiast I must say British magazines are plain better than American automotive magazines, maybe in exception to Car and Driver. But evo magazine is easily the best of them. No one can match evo's articles, stories, comparisons, special cover stories (such as Performance Car of the Year and Trackday Car of the Year), photography that no one else can match, and everything else you'd want from an automotive magazine. In short, evo magazine is brilliant. My only complaints is that their acceleration times are almost always about 1/2 second off (which is an extremely small problem, a problem that is forgiven by everything else that is given in this magazine) and a price tag that is higher than any other I've seen. Buying from America, I spend about $10 per issue, but let me tell you, it's worth it. No doubt evo is the best automotive magazine out there, and it is worth the money. Well... only if you're very interested in cars. Just don't expect to find any rednecks in their 4x4s in the mud

New moon is an okay magazine, but some of the articals might bore you like about "Duck Tape fan." or something like that, it is sort of like a school magazine that teachers might want you to ONLY read in their class, but some of the stuff is good, I am a magazine freak and I have all the Discovery girls issues and it is nothing like new moon,  New moon has facts about not be mean but "Dead people." and that is just really boring. I suggest this magazine to a History fan or a science fan, because it is for you..  Discovery girls atleast has Celebrity interviews and makeup and things about crushes, and reader art and cool stuff, but this magazine has things like:

1- a topic about stuff that is annoying and one girl was saying that she was not ''gay.'' but always was holding  her friends hand.. :0  it is gross...

2- a fan of duck tape, it shows a picture of girl having tuck tape all over her.. Creepy..

3-  Wierd musems.. Uh sigh, boring!

I tried out this magazine thinking it was just what I needed, yeah right, it was boring, the only part I liked was the letters and the comics,

I suggest getting a subsription to BOP or discovery girls, because you wont enjoy this! 

PLUS it's 5.50! I am so mad because I wasted it  on this Crud.

I am 13 and this the second worst magazine I've read! 

The magazine  for any girl is Discovery girls, and my favorite issue is august/september 2004 because Taylor Dooley is on it.

I love this magazine! I love how the main message is "be yourself!" It has no advertizments and it doesn't say you have to be beautiful to be happy. I'm really tom-boy, and alot of other magazines make you feel like "normal" girls are obsessed with IMing, fashion, makeup, and boys! I hate those magazines! Read " A TOTAL SUCKER!!!!" another review of this magazine, it says that "normal" teenage girls, have crushes, and hate to be out of style! Am I like that? NO WAY! This magazine is just right, it has probably 1 TRUE artical about that stuff, but it's not really flirty or something! GET THIS MAGAZINE!

This magazine is great! For sport-specific magazines, this is probably one of the best that I have seen. Yes, the photos are large and detailed. But, the kicker is the writing. Incredible content without being wordy. Variety of topics and approaches brings out varying highlights of the sport. Just very impressive

This is one of the bibles for anyone in graphic design, advertising, illustration or photograhy. It digs deep into industry trends, features portfolios of upcoming industry stars, and is a must for anyone who takes their craft seriously. While the issues are great, their Regional Design Annual is the must-buy issue every year. It really lets you know who the cream of the crop are. Just flipping through it will make you better at what you do (and you'll even stop using hackneyed phrases like &quot;cream of the crop&quot;)

If you are looking for more opinion than straight reporting and stats rather than highlights, TSN is your sports magazine.

Years back, TSN was seemingly slated to go the way of Sport magazine; one that couldn't find a niche in the Internet and cable era, which ultimately would spell its demise. It also took TSN to take a body blow from USA Today - when its Baseball Weekly cut into readership - and overhand rights by ESPN the Magazine to find its way. TSN is truly a survivor.

The in-season reporting is not based on editor's deciding what's hot. Those seeking out quick hits - for example - on auto racing don't have to wait for the Indy 500 or the NASCAR Chase for information. 

My biggest criticism is the reliance on lists - the best of, the worst of, etc. - that tend to become major stories when certain sports are ready to crank up for the year. Granted, many radio-talkers will pick up on the lists - and oftentimes give the compilers time to gab about it - but these features ultimately fall into a "lazy week" of gathering news.

Overall, though, TSN is better than ever and has a product that any sports fan would find informative.

Years ago 'The Sporting News' was the fans' 'bible'. I can remember what a special feeling it gave to look at it, the real lowdown, the most bottom- line stuff , more statistics than even the greatest baseball nut could ever remember. 
I no longer really follow the game, or any of the games as I once did.
And most of the figures even the names of the players are strange to me now. 
I picture in my mind my uncle the late Broadway Abe Freedman who lived his life to see the Yankees lose , picking up this paper and cursing at some columnist proclaiming the Yankees the favorites to take it all in the coming year.
That coming year and so many coming years are already gone. 
But there will be a next year, a next season, another Sporting News' and someone somewhere in America devouring those numbers as if they were crackers jack and cold beer at the seventh- inning stretch.

TSN is an excellent sports magazine for the general sports fan.
It covers nearly all the sports in and out of season, including NASCAR autoracing.  A sports fan will find something of interest in every issue.  I was able to find a free subscription which makes it ever better!  I would recommend it to any sportsfan who wants to read about his favorite teams or sport

Sports car International never loses focus on its mission: providing insight into everything that defines a true sports car. I do not need to waste time flipping past crossover reviews or cup holder size specs. From the absolutely most exotic and expensive supercars to the new hard-top mx-5, it just sticks to real sports cars. Seems simple, right? Yet no one else gets it quite as right

I have subscribed to the all of the big car magazines for years, I am glad I stumbled upon Sports Car International in Australia of all places.  The articles are all well written and devoid of the mindless blather you find in most of the other rags.  I enjoy that they only write about interesting cars, I don't read car magazines to help me decide weather to buy the new Camry or the Accord, most of the other magazines cater to this crowd to one degree or another.  The photography keeps me pacing in front of the mail box waiting for the next issue, the shots of the Bugatti Veyron on the salt flats were the latest ones to blow my mind.  My only complaint is that the magazine  is bi-monthly, I would gladly pay twice the money to receive it every month.

Well I echo what all the other reviews have said about this magazine.  

Subscibing to this magazine is making sure that unbiased articles can still exist for all makes and models of sports cars.  You see there are extremely few ads in this magazine and so even though the mag is a bit smaller than say a Car and Driver magazine it is loaded front to back with reviews.  One after another.  The photography is fantastic and just looking at the pictures makes you wonder what some of the other mainstream magazines could be like if they could just try to put out a better quality product.  Even the cardstock of the paper is first rate.  It makes the Car and Driver mag feel so cheap in comparison.  Both come to my address and I honestly can say that I look forward to both but for different reasons.  I first stumbled upon this magazine at an airport 6 years ago and I am so glad that I did.  I would love to see more articles with affordable sports car alternatives as they print at the end of each issue.  I remember an article about what used sports cars you could buy with certain dollar amounts and this was to me (a man on a budget) a rather nice look at the market as a whole that year.  Also we are not all 16 year olds out there subscirbing to this magazine so it would be nice to see Road tests on at least one moderatly priced non exotic each issue.  Thank you for putting together such a high quality magazine for your readers to enjoy.

This is a great magazine for people who like to drive for the fun of it.  Rather than try to cover the entire automotive industry like some of the other magazines, Sports Car International focuses on cars that are fun to drive.  The articles are interesting and well written.  The authors aren't afraid to point out a car's flaws, and the reviews and impressions seem quite balanced.  
Most importantly, this magazine is written from the perspective of the driving enthusiast.  The authors focus on the things that make a car fun to drive, not stuff like cupholders.
If you're into fun cars, both new and old, this really is a must-have magazine.

The magazine is made exclusively for hardcore bodybuilders.  If you're into fitness, this magazine ain't for you.  However, if you're into BODYBUILDING - HARDCORE, then this is the magazine for you.  It is jam-packed with muscle upon muscle of some of the most hardcore bodybuilders in the business.

To people like him I say continue living in your fantasy world and go read Muscle and Fitness.  There you can keep believing that the pro's get to be 280 @ 3% body fat by using creatine.  As for the rest of us who do not live in the land of Oz we can all benefit from the no-nonsense scientific articles put forth in Muscular Development.  This is THE BEST magazine to read if you really want to know how to get freaky big.   The beginning of the magazine is filled with excerpts from various medical and scientific journals and the articles that follow give you some great advice on `roids, supplements, contest prep, dieting and training.  By far the best magazine in the business

This is the best Artist's magazine being published. I have had subscriptions to them all at one time or another. I have been a subscriber for at least ten years now.  It's the only magazine that I can actually use in a class on how to:  My students learn from the articles,and so do I!  K.J. Murra
