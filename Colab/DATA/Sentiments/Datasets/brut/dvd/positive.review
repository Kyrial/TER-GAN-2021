The story of "Alice in Wonderland" was controversial from the moment that the Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, aka Lewis Carroll, wrote it.  Some took the story as horror rather than a childhood fantasy.  Others consider Alice's journey as a trip into or through insanity.  For better or worse, Disney did capture many of these elements, and the same criticisms of the books that form the basis of this film apply to the film.  However, there are also those who loved the books and loved the film.  Normally I recommend Disney classis without reservations.  In the case of this movie, I will keep a couple of provisos.

Alice is a young girl bored by her lessons.  As the length of the lessons grows, Alice soon drifts off, until a white rabbit passes by, muttering to himself that he is late.  Alice follows the white rabbit and falls into a rabbit hole that seems to fall forever.  Luckily for Alice her dress opens out into a kind of parachute and slows her descent.
Once at the bottom of the hole, Alice discovers a door into which she is unable to pass because the door is too small.  However, there is a vial labeled "drink me" that Alice discovers makes her small enough to go through the door.

Alice is soon on her way into a series of surreal adventures that are in the best tradition of adult animation.  Indeed, Alice might have worked better as an adult story given the number of references to adult vices and frailties throughout the film.  Even the fundamental basis of Alice's journey through Wonderland owes as much to psychological references as it does childhood fantasies.  The ending of Alice's journey in particular is quite frightening, especially to younger children, embodying all that can be horrible in nightmares.  I remember seeing "Alice in Wonderland" as a child, and I remember I thought the ending was scary, and I was relieved when Alice was able to escape back to the normal world.

Given that this film is well over fifty years old, I was disturbed by the smoking caterpillar, if for no other reason than our current knowledge of what smoking does.  The smoke did negatively affect Alice as it made her cough.  Perhaps there is an object lesson for children here.  While some consider many of the references to allude to drugs, I think that is a modern interpretation.  I think eating or drinking items to get larger or smaller was merely a convenient plot device for the author rather than an allegory for drug use.  Remember that this story was first published in 1869.

I believe this film is excessively criticized by those who do not like its style and the post-era associations with negative elements that were never intended by the original author and by Disney.

For all these provisos, this film is excellent.  It matches "Fantasia" in its surreal visions, and the construct and tying together of the individual stories is superb.  The animation is marvelous as well, readily illustrating the vision of Alice's journey.

This movie is one of those rare Disney films that I am unable to recommend to all viewers.  Whether you will enjoy this film is strictly a matter of personal taste.  If you enjoy animation oriented toward adults, then you may find this animation a treat.  If you are open-minded about the story and consider when the story was written and animated, you may also find that you enjoy it.  I do recommend this movie for slightly older children, perhaps 8 and above, considering some of the disturbing images.  Good luck!

I covered a similar theme in my international relations MA - whilst any programme made for TV has to be reasonable breif on the subject, I found this to be a very well argued and produced programme.

I recomend it, not so much as some dark conspiracy, but more a genuine question about large private interest with huge influence in a democratic country. We should question to make sure that what happens in our name, is always in our interest

At 23 years of age, I can truly say that I have been a lifetime fan of Sesame Street. Watching the 3-DVD set of Sesame Street - Old School, Vol. 1 has been both nostalgic and enlightening. Because I was born practically a decade after most of the material on this set originally aired, I expected most of the content to be new to me (I was barely a year old when Mr. Hooper's death was explained to the world), but that was not the case. Many of the short films and interstitials were familiar (and not just because I used to watch Sesame Unpaved on Noggin) to me as a viewer from the mid-1980s, and I think that just underscores the quality the show has exhibited from the beginning. Sesame Street truly revolutionized children's programming, not just because it was educational, but because it was (and remains) entertaining, not pandering. I'll admit, seeing Gordon with an afro, Orange Oscar and the first few tries at Big Bird's head still freak me out a bit (as they did when I saw them on Noggin several years back), but the show itself is just as good as I ever remembered, something that cannot be said for most nostalgia entertainment (like Transformers or He-Man or JEM).

The set contains five full episodes from the first five seasons, and 54 (the liner notes are incorrect, they should have asked Count for help) bonus clips. The set also includes the 25 minute pitch-film that was made before the series originally aired, explaining Sesame Street's message and motive. Although the episodes have a disclaimer that it is not necessarily intended for today's pre-school children, I believe they would probably enjoy "classic" Street even more than the current lineup of shows. The fact that today's pre-schoolers may be more advanced than the Sesame Street of yore can really be attributed to Sesame Street itself, and that's pretty cool. Still, I personally appreciate that the aim of the set is at adults, because so many of us associate our childhood with Sesame Street. A booklet is included that gives a brief overview of the series from the first five years and I found it informative. 

According to Muppet Central, a few sketches were altered or removed for music copyright issues (one with Stevie Wonder, one with Rogers & Hammerstein), but because I never saw the originals, I found nothing amiss. What astounded me more than anything was that at the end of the first five years, more than 600 episodes of the show had been produced. No wonder they can't release full seasons! Although the full-length episodes are great, my favorite part are the additional sketches from each respective season. Seeing Kermit sing "Bein' Green" in its original form, the "Bread, Milk and Butter" cartoon and the "In in the Sky with Diamonds" parody is a real treat.

The picture quality is great -- especially considering the program's age (and the fact that it was one of the first programs to be recorded on video, although film was used for most of the interstitials) -- I doubt the show ever looked as good as it looks right now. The sound quality is good too -- mono of course -- but clear and crisp.

Overall, I highly recommend this set for anyone who loves or loved Sesame Street. For those who were born after these episodes aired (like me), looking back at the beginning is really special. It is clear that everyone involved had a true love for teaching and interacting with children and taking television to another level

Julia plays a struggling mother trying to make ends meet and then she gets a job and takes on a Giant Corporation in a Court Of Law.Julia manages to extract a lot of information fom people mainly through her mammary glands and the benefits of a Wonderbra but that is just about all that this movie has going for it. I give this film 5 stars because Julia does look pretty attractive in it at most times

This film can be interpreted any number of ways: as a farce; a tragedy; or just plain Shakespearean comedy. Brenda Blethyn has, in the past, acted in each of these genres and she brings that experience into Saving Grace with exquisite skill

I tried to rent this DVD from an online service about a week ago. Unfortunately, the DVD was damaged and unplayable, but not in the usual way I've seen before (like a disc cracked all the way through). It looked like someone had turned the playable side face-up and tapped a small nail with a hammer on it. The cracks had that kind of splintery pattern like a broken window. Anyway, I returned the copy and ordered another, which I received today. Again, this one is also unplayable and is cracked in an odd way. I just reported this problem online to the DVD rental company and ordered a replacement copy. However, I let them know that they may want to check their inventory of this DVD as someone may be intentionally destroying the DVDs. If I get another one that is cracked or unplayable in any way, I'm going to just buy a copy because the movie must really have gotten under someone's skin for them to do something like that.

This movie is a scream!  I laughed until I thought I was going to die.  Comedy doesn't get any better than this.  The characters are incredible.  It's amazing the actors could keep straight faces while making this movie!

Do yourself a favor and watch this movie!  It's even better the second time around

"Ils se marirent et eurent beaucoup d'enfants" ("Happily Ever After") is a cleverly written examination of contemporary views on love, lust, marriage, infidelity, and the single life.  Writer/Director/Actor Yvan Attal has come up with a winner, an entertaining, funny, and ultimately thoughtful treatise on how we cope with partnering.

Three men work together in a car dealership.  Vincent (Yvan Attal) is the apparently happily married man with a beautiful wife Gabrielle (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and child.  Georges (Alain Chabat) on the other hand is in a tumultuous marriage with Nathalie (Emmanuelle Seigner) who has gender issues that go far beyond feminism and negatively influence their child.  Fred (Alain Cohen) is single, bedding every lovely woman he encounters, balancing trysts between mornings, afternoons, and evenings and is deeply envied for his Don Juanism. But Fred actually longs for the sense of belonging that married men enjoy.

The men's lives intertwine on many levels.  Most important, we discover that Vincent has a lover (Angie David) despite his idyllic married life and while it is Georges whom one would expect to seek solace from a lover, he remains faithful to his nagging wife!  Gabrielle senses Vincent's affair and encounters a sexy man in a music shop (Johnny Depp) who begins to preoccupy her thoughts.  She is a real estate broker and comes close to an assignation with a client but remains faithful. All the while she daydreams about her brief encounter with Depp and satisfies her wandering eye with those memories.  Fred discovers that one of his paramours is pregnant and happily decides to leap into the married fray.  The only 'adults' sharing advice here are Vincent's long married parents (Anouk Aime and Claude Berri in very welcome comeback cameos!) and it is this 'standard' that adds the final humor to the film.

The manner in which all three men deal with their living situations asks as many questions as it gives answers.  Attal finds joy in all forms of coupling and is careful to offer all sides of decisions his characters make in arriving at what provides them happiness.  This is a smart movie with terrific twists.  There is just enough slapstick (an all out food fight between Vincent and Gabrielle - real life husband and wife team Attal and Gainsbourg - that proves to be one of the fun-loving bits of silliness that binds their marriage) to keep the mood light.  Not a profound film, but a joyous French comedy handled by total pros!  In French and English with subtitles. Recommended. Grady Harp, October 0

if you are a GHITS SAC fan this DVD is a must, 
series wise the dvd contains 4 new episodes and the tachikoma stories are back as well, in fact the tachikoma's are now back in action in the series Too. Graphic wise, 2nd gig drops the funny pastel look of the first season and returns to its dark look as it was in the first movie, the CG is allot more fine-tuned and the action is awesome!!!, the opener has also improved significantly for the series!!!, Sound wise the series is awesome as usual 5.1 DTS Japanese & 5.1 DTS English, with stereo for both and there are English subtitles if you chose to run it with Japanese audio. 
Overall they squealed SAC season 1 perfectly, this not a series to miss if you're a shell fan!

I was one of those that never got a chance to sit down during the live broadcast to watch Live 8 and certainly regretted that. However, I was fortunate enough to find this copy at Amazon and it's been everything I had expected and more. I'm a huge Pink Floyd fan and their performance alone was worth the price of the box set not to mention all of the other fantastic performances. I would highly recommend this box set to any music fan from any generation--truly a "must have" for anyone's collection!

I thought the first Ice Age was great.  This one is good, not great.  They really used scrat better this time than before, but the rest of the characters were.....not undeveloped, but it just didn't have as many hilarious situations.  Sid is as hilarious as ever, but manny and diego doen't do as much.  

ITs a good, fun movie, but its not as good as the first one, rent it though, it does have some hilarious scenes

We purchased this DVD because we really need to work with our son on his reading and it's a great supplement to reading books.  He loves this DVD and we love the variety in it's approach.  We didn't realize until we watched it with our kids that so much of what we viewed as children really stuck with us through the years

WOW! What more can I say! Just watching this was an absolutely extraordinary experience. This is a "behind the scenes" look at photography. It gets you up close and personal with the photographers and lets you know what is involved in trying to capture the "shot of a lifetime". I own many National Geographic books, but you won't be able to appreciate what goes into each photograph without watching this DVD. Even those who are not interested in photography will be able to appreciate it

I LOVED "Never Cry Wolf"!!!  I saw it years ago on video, but can only imagine the DVD is as good or better.  I was disappointed to see that it was listed with 'The Bear' to buy together....  I love Anthony Hopkins, and the Bear was one of the worst movies I have EVER seen.  Don't let the pairing with 'The Bear' scare you off.  "Never Cry Wolf" is excellent!
Sorry Tony :-)  Okay, I just realized that 'The Edge' was the one with Anthony Hopkins... my apologies to the Bear!   Anyway, get "Never Cry Wolf"!  You won't be disappointed!!

In America is a near perfect movie dealing w/ grief and learning to live again after tragedy. It is also about hope.

The characters are engaging and each one is dealing with grief in their own way. They are all trying to find a new life literally in Amerca and figuratively w/ in themselves after a variety of tragedies and set backs.

The only real downside I can note on this movie is that I would have liked a little more back ground on Frankie and Mateo but I think the movie tries hard to put you in the midst of these lives without arbitrary flashbacks.

Besides, a great story the cinematograpy is well suited with its combination of views through a child's camcorder and closer scenes of the city and family life. I especially liked ths subtle way the camera shows the changing of seasons. 

If you want to enjoy a good story and a bit of tear jerker thent his is a must see. If for nothing else than the performances of "Mateo" and young "Kristie." Just amazing.

The print looks like you're watching it through muddy water; is this something to do with the unclear "public domain" status of this and other of Capra's works?  Doesn't he have a family that could help out his DVDs the way that Chaplin's family has done, or even, to use the opposite extreme, the family of Edgar Ulmer, who have released superlative versions of some pretty dicey movies?  The point is that if people are paying for something they deserve to get it served up nice, and all the various DVDS of MEET JOHN DOE are painful to watch.

We've heard for years of the re-worked ending of the film, and that another one exists (or existed at one time).  Bring it on!  For now the pleasure is nearly entirely in watching Gary Cooper react to Barbara Stanwyck's pure life.  It's sort of like BALL OF FIRE but a bit more subtle.  Moviemakers knew they were on to agood thing teaming the two, because Cooper's slow-moving, nearly snakelike screen presence got an injection of caffeine when placed next to Stanwyck's vibrant beauty and her gorgeous clear gaze and complexion.  She doesn't even have to speak, she emanates something very basic in her bones and her posture.  Okay, the movie writes itself into a corner, for what else is going to happen except that if Gary Cooper is not going to kill himself the movie will break the trust it's established with the viewers.  This has always been DOE's problem, that it has to cheat to come out ahead of itself, and it didn't work in 1943 and it still isn't working now.  It's great up until about an hour and fifteen minutes; then you feel the gears start to whine and complain as "Hollywood" tries to solve a basically philosophical dilemma

Back in the 1980s, back before every television show was "CSI: City Of Your Choice" and "Law & Order: Crime Division of Your Choice," there was a veritable plethora of well-written, clever, hour-long mystery programmes - "Magnum P.I.," "Murder, She Wrote," "Moonlighting," "Hart to Hart," "The A-Team," to name just a few.  And this was when most people still only had three commercial networks to choose from (not counting PBS).  But far and away, the best of these mystery shows (and perhaps the most under-rated) was "Remington Steele," in which Pierce Brosnan (with second billing!) and Stephanie Zimbalist fought crime with style, dash, wit, comedy, and a bit of romance.  The series, with its rat-a-tat dialogue, vaguely Deco feel (a slight Deco revival was the only good thing about `80s dï¿½cor), and occasional zaniness, at times harkens back to the wonderful Preston Sturges-esque screwball comedies of the 1930s and `40s.  Indeed, it's clear from the moment that Brosnan appears on the screen in episode one of season one that not only did he have the star power of Classic Hollywood, but he was a Cary Grant for our times; devastatingly handsome in dapper Saville Row suits with an accent as charming and distinctive as Grant's.  (As an aside, it's also clear that Brosnan was born to play James Bond - truly, who was surprised that he was bestowed with the honor, albeit belatedly?  We won't get into the infamous Season Five vs. Bond debacle.) 

In the entertainment field, there are actors-with-a-lowercase-"a" (pretty much everyone falls into this category nowadays), Actors-with-a-capital-"A" (truly impressive sorts, such as Judi Dench, Vanessa Redgrave, and Anthony Hopkins), and then there are Stars.  Brosnan is clearly the lattermost, bright and luminous.  Zimbalist, as sleuth Laura Holt, is spunky, and makes a valiant attempt to be Rosalind Russell to Brosnan's Grant, but, somehow, she falls slightly flat.  Nevertheless, there's no denying the chemistry between the two, which is what really "makes" the show.  (This is particularly remarkable considering that the two notoriously didn't get along whilst filming the series.)

References to Classic Hollywood are constant, and amusing - Remington Steele, the (sort of) reformed con-man-with-a-heart-of-gold has an encyclopedic knowledge of film, and often inadvertently stumbles across the solution to the weekly puzzle by drawing a comparison to a classic film.  ("Joseph Cotton, Orson Wells, `The Third Man,' British Lion Film Corporation, 1949." is a particular favorite throughout the run of the series, as are Cary Grant films and, ironically, the occasional Bond reference.)  The show was scored by the wonderful Henry Mancini, he of "Charade" (A Grant reference, yet again!), "The Pink Panther," and "Breakfast at Tiffany's" fame (among many others), which of course, adds to the caper/romantic feel of the show.  (By the way, I'll take the somewhat chaste clinches of Remington and Laura over the sordidness of "Sex and the City" to daydream about any day of the week!)

I'm so pleased that Remington Steele has been released on DVD.  I was seven years old when it debuted, and thoroughly enjoyed it at the time (I was a sophisticated child).  But I hadn't seen it since, and once again, have found myself charmed by each and every episode.  For those who are too young to remember the series, check it out - it's much more worthwhile than anything on the air now, and for those of you who *do* remember it, revisit.  It's worth your time and money.

...But I'm giving season four 4 stars, because there aren't any subtitles in this set. They also didn't have subtitles for season 3, but they did had subtitles for seasons 1 & 2. Strange, huh? However, the quality of the DVDs are fine and the episodes, of course, are wonderful to watch. At the end of this season the Meathead is supposed to graduate and move out for good, but he decides to stay with the Bunkers a little longer, so he can get his Masters degree. 

  There aren't any special features or anything in this DVD set, but as long as the episodes are uncut, I'm happy. If you're a fan of the show, this DVD set is a MUST-HAVE!

We have the kind of family where we promised that all ex's and all family children, blood related or not, would be family.  People think I'm strange because my friendship with my husband's ex and her family is so important to me.  She was visiting us and our granddaughter in Ontario, CAN, she lives in L.A. and she wakens to classical music every morning.  I decided to put on Concert for George, which always brings me to tears, but she never took her eyes off of the screen.  She especially enjoyed Ravi Shankar and his daughter's opening to the concert and educated us on what the music meant.  As I told my husband...no person I have shared this DVD with has ever left it with a 'so what' opinion.  They all loved it and I think, most of my friends have it by now, Beatle lovers or not.  Thanks to all who made this a tribute to George, but also a way to educate people about his talents, his many, many friends, his loving wife and son, all of whom, obviously adored George and his music, as do I....and my close friend Mary

Feeding the cat...those girls shold put on a sweater. Love this movie, 50's detective noir set in 70's California. The beach, the hospital, Mexico, the supermarket, it's all great - and the theme song keeps going throughout over and over. Final scene pays homage to The Third Man, beautiful. A bit of violence, but "That's how I treat someone I love, and I don't even like you". Never seen an Elliot Gould movie I like more than this, & it's my favorite Altman as well

Our one year old loves this one, and so do I.  The music is wonderful.  The creative incorporation of Vivaldi's Four Seasons and Monet's Masterpieces are entertaining and educational.  The children, little puppets and sequences with toys and nature makes this interesting for our child.  We watch this one most of all the Baby Einstein's that we have.

My son was over 2 before we introduced BE videos.  There are definitely those which cater to the younger baby with lots of random images, but this one is great in that it has puppet shows with a little plot, as well as discrete integrated units for each of the seasons.  Unlike some of the other BE's with random visuals, here the visuals truly support the learning objective desired.  Concur with other reviewers as well that this is the most robust BE video in Bonus Features. It has both puppet shows and another short learning video of all the seasons.  

And no I didn't care for the commercial either...

special effects have come along way from 1974 when westworld first came out,but this little gem still hangs head and shoulders above most sci-fi entertainment.
      welcome to delos,vacation spot of the future,where you can have a once and a lifetime fantasy come true. you may choose westworld,romanworld,and meadevilworld! you can,for $1000.00 a day(1974 prices) you can live out your most secert fantisies.it's all set up to please you and you can't get hurt. of course if that were true then we have no movie. soon after the latest batch of people get to the park,the robots begin to have breakdowns,like a virus(i still remember the reviews calling the idea of computers getting viruses as "to far out there,no one will believe it" wonder if they still think so). james brolin and richard benjemin are two friends enjoying westworld when the whole park goes on the blink and the robots start to kill thr guest.
  the final chase(with evil robot yul brynner,still dressed as chris from his stint in the maganfict seven cloths)is very thrilling and the whole movie has the feel of a park ride gone bad. a very fun movie

I first caught The Black Swan several years ago on television and was immediately blown away. Sure, it's just a Swashbuckler, just a Pirate film - with the usual plot, the usual bits and pieces. There's nothing outrageously distinctive about The Black Swan, at least at first sight. Ty Power stars as Jamie Boy, expert pirate who ends up by plot machinations in the employ of ex-pirate and now governer of Jamaica, Captain Morgan Laird Cregar). Morgan's been given a pardon for his dastardly deeds and with his new title attempts to rid the seas of the dastardly buccaneers, sending Jamie Boy off to find George Sanders' Captain Leech. Only there's a twist in the mix - and some dastardly fop's out to make a mockery of Morgan by using Leech as his private pirate to ruin the governer. To make matters worse Jamie not only seemingly disappears - apparently in league with the nefarious Leech, but he also kidnaps the previous governer's daughter, played with feistyness by Catherien O'Hara..... 

So it's all the usual stuff - kidnapping, sword-fighting, stealing, drinking, pacts with arch enemies and stock characters throughout. But you know what - it's not that you know what you're getting, it's that you get a whole lot more than you ever thought you would. Sure, everything's the same, but somehow strangely different. The story and characters are as seen before - but with the likes of Sanders, Power and O'Hara as the love interest, and the great character actor Cregar playing against type - you have life breathed into the character's that's so often lacking. And the original story by one Rafael Sabatini - who also brought us Captain Blood and The Sea Hawk - is a rip-roaring boys-own adventure. 

Director Henry King - no stranger to producing similar adventure styled flicks - cracks the picture along with some sense of urgency. It's a spare, fluid film with a simple, but fun, narrative and visual splendour that puts other films, even those made today, out to pasture. 

This DVD manages to capture that splendour in abundance - the technicolor photography is gorgeously rendered herein, with all of the detailed production and costune design seen at its best. Just check out the restoration comparison to see how good. In addition the disc also features a fine commentary from historian Rudy Behlmer.

If you want a cracking piece of entertainment that puts shame to modern counterparts of the genre, look no further

I read the book in middle school and watched the movie shortly afterwards.  A few of the characters were switched around, but I was so impressed with the adaptation. A thriller that still makes me nervous and jumpy - the kids in the kitchen scene and when Mr. Arnold's arm drops on Ellie's shoulder as she's trying to turn the generator back on, for example. There have been countless lines I've memorized and quoted at appropriate and innapropriate times, due to my obsession.

And after watching it more than 25 times, I've come to appreciate it more. Great cast - Sam Neil is my favorite. Richard Attenborough is a little too cute and nice, but I liked his white clothing, the hat, and the amber cane. Wayne Knight was incredible as Nedry, the slob. He's as likeable as ever, though somewhat the villain. I always hate it when he dies. Jeff Goldblum fit the description of Ian Malcom from Crichton's novel well. Crichton sparked my interest in Chaos Theory, sometimes called The Butterfly Effect. I am a firm believer in it. And of course, in the novel and film, Malcolm was right. "Life finds a way..."  

(In Chaos Theory, the system is very sensitive to small changes in external conditions, and "random" --unpredictable-- events result from the "normal" equation/setup, because there is never a fixed set of outcomes; the system is unpredictable because of its complexity. Hammond thought his system was without error, that he was in complete control. He believed that the dinosaurs would fail to reproduce because all were engineered to be female, but he was wrong - the dinosaurs evolved because of the replacement amphibian DNA that was used to fill in the gaps in the dinosaur DNA. This DNA gave the dinosaurs the ability to change sex in order to reproduce, "survive," in a single-sex environment. And it turned out that Hammond was wrong about many other equations - things are not as black and white as he thought, and it is problematic to predict long-term behavior of his animals.)

Love the scene where the lawyer is eaten while sitting on the toilet.

We watched the Mr. DNA segment in a high school biology class. I've always thought it explained the process very well for something that is complicated (though I found Mr. Hammond's live speaking lines to be unrealistic...was he really planning to be there for each tour?).

The kids were kind of annoying. I didn't notice this until I was a little older, but Lex ("I prefer to be called a hacker") uses Silicon Graphics' 3D file system navigator to turn power back on in the park. Their logo is on the monitor. If only UNIX were as popular as Windows is now...

Anyway, the soundtrack was classic - it was the first CD I bought, back in the mid-90s.  Tonya Harding skated to the theme at the 1994 Olympics, or some other competition. I only liked her because of her excellent music choice

The Station Agent is a touching, yet off the beaten path kind of flick that I found simply endearing to watch. Fin (Peter Dinklage) has just inherited a train depot somewhere out in New Jersey. Having a passion for trains, he embraces this as his home. However, he only wishes to be left alone and finds that's not as easy to do as he would have thought.

First, he discovers Joe (Bobby Cannavale) who has set up a food truck outside his home. Joe is a conversationalist, desperate to talk to anyone and everyone. Next Fin meets Olivia (Patricia Clarkson), who almost runs him off the road, twice. These three appear to have nothing in common, and despite all odds, they form a friendship that is heartwarming to see. 

All three actors gave amazing performances. Dinklage, as always, commands every scene he is in. I've missed seeing him since the bastards at CBS quashed Threshold, so it was nice to see something with him in it again. Cannavale amused me with his character, Joe, who really needed to "get a life." The idea of quite time is not something he can easily grasp to say the least. And Clarkson radiated as Olivia, a character trying to put her life back together again after having lost her son and having her husband leave her. 

What I liked most about this flick is the honest portrayal it gave us of life through Fin's eyes. There were the chronic stares he got just for being smaller than average. Plus, there was a scene in the grocery store where the cashier didn't even see that he was standing there, so she didn't ring him up until he could get her attention. It just made me think about what it must really be like to not fit in the standard mold physically.

All in all, excellent film

2 Fast 2 Furious is one of those sequels that comes around every so often that doesn't require you to have seen the original. I saw this movie for the first time not too long after it came out, and having never seen the original, I thought I would be lost and wouldn't enjoy myself as much as other people, but on the contrary - I left the experience much happier than when I came in.

This film is full of quick one-liners that deserve a laugh. The special effects and the car races will leave your mouth gaping open. I have heard and read that people didn't appreciate this film as much because it seemed to focus more on a plot than the first film did rather than focus more on the races, but overall, I think the balance works well. Even thinking of the plot that we are left with, I really can't see another time when a race would even be appropriate.

And as for people saying that this film is worse than the original, I would have to disagree...Why? Frankly, I have always been a firm believer than Vin Diesel is entirely overrated as an actor. (I mean, c'mon - Have you seen the Pacifier?) He's nothing more than a meat head who, while able to do pretty good fight scenes, should leave the dialogue to someone else. 

Yes, this film is for the younger crowd, and there are numerous occasions when unbelievable events take place (take the boat jumping as an example), but there is no saying that an older person wouldn't enjoy it as well...The only thing that I will say is that you really shouldn't go into this film expecting an Oscar worthy performance, or else you will be disappointed. If you sit back and take this as the fun romp that it is, however, you will thoroughly enjoy yourself

****THIS COMMENT MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!***
Anyone who saw this growing up has a soft spot in their hearts for it; I've encountered enough people over the course of my 37 yrs who perk up at the mention of it to be aware of its place in a lot of our memories. This has been satirized on the Simpsons, which proves it has embedded itself in the national pop culture consciousness. Anyone who has read the book its based on, the incredible "I am Legend" by Richard Matheson, knows that this film has very little in common with it beyond its intial premise--and even that is not followed too closely. All of the criticisms of THE OMEGA MAN are valid: It is very dated and not at all scary or intense and some of the stunts and special effects are laughably, ludicrously cheesy; the villains--who should have been more terrifying than even Romero's zombies--are just crazed albino hippie Luddites and the last half of the film, once Chuck hooks up with Rosalind Cash and the kiddies, is really a let down. But the scenes that open the film of Heston hefting a cool-looking machine gun while decked out in Austin Powers-style finery (!) staring in angst at an old calendar or losing his mind for a moment hallucinating the sound of telephones ringing in the deserted city still pack a punch. This was the second movie, after 1959's THE WORLD,THE FLESH, AND THE DEVIL, to successfully pull off the eerie effect of being the last living human being in a huge empty city. Both films established the visual motif of streets  filled with blowing waves of newspapers and swirling trash.After years of seeing this on tv -- a guaranteed late September or early October event every year for a few years on the local tv station during my Pacific Northwest childhood in the old dark ages before CABLE TV and the videocassette revolution, its nice to see this movie on DVD with a beautiful widescreen transfer. It looks and sounds great. As a child I always liked the music, particularly the "surprise party" theme that plays when the villains make thir first appearance.
It rocks here in all its xylophone and funky electric organ and horns glory

saw the trailer online and knew I'd love it on dvd
I was right
laughed my ass off 8 times after watching it
so many times of the 8 times I watched it that is
it is sad Tucker couldn't be in this one and last Friday movie but it's still great
the new cast members add more humor just as much the ones in the second and first Friday movies
the plot is deeper
more twisted
more funny
more senseless
especially with Day Day
i laughed so hard
the extras are worth it
Cube is great at making films
so no one slam him
he is an amazing film maker
considering he used to star in movies
when he can star in one and create it
that's more then genious
that's innovative
he does good at starring and making movies
give him props people
and you can't always please everyone with what you make
remember that
I loved this one. and will get the other 2 movies on dvd when I can. the scenes are just hilarious and priceless like the other Friday movies. so glad i bought this on dvd. give it a chance people.

Season 3 of The L-Word is by far the best yet.

The character development and story have come so far since the 1st season, and are even better than season 2.

They have scaled back the sex a little bit, but when they do put it in, the sparks really fly.

I love the l-word

Spurlock decided to undertake an interesting experiment with his own health; eat nothing but McDonald's fast food for 30 days.  The result; his health gets ruined.

While Spurlock's experience is not exactly a scientific study you could publish in the Lancet, it is a disturbing examination of what fast food and soft drink are doing to our health.

I rarely eat McDonalds (though I enjoy the odd coke) however the restaurant chain is quite popular in Australia, as it is worldwide.  The strength of Mcdonalds and other fast food chains is obviously providing tasty food at low prices very quickly to the consumer.  McDonalds essentially applied the industrial technique of mass production to fast food, and made Ray Kroc (its founder) a fortune.  

I don't really buy the line that multinational corporations are evil, because they are multinational corporations; we have to remember corporations exist in relation to governments and ultimately consumers, as well as shareholders.  We happily buy coke, McDonalds, cigarettes, and many other things obviously bad for our health, and yet seem to like to blame the company which provides that addictive substance to us when our health goes bad.  In our individualistic culture, we tend to all too readily avoid self-responsibility and the virtue of self-control, and in my view this is part of the reason fast food exists.

However, the rocketing levels of obesity, especially amoung children, are of great concern, and it is clear the marketing techniques often aimed at children by fast food companies is at least unethical.  We need to make sure the tide of obesity turns in the negative direction, otherwise this generation risks dying earlier than our parents and grandparents.  Spurlock's experience is a warning to all of us to take the warnings on eating well and exercising seriously, and not ignoring them for the sake of self-indulgence

Brando can sing!!
Guys and Dolls is proof. One of the all time great musicals and the biggest box office hit of 1955, has Brando as the main lead and he is ably supported by THE VOICE - Sinatra. Now only a mad man will say that Brando is a better singer than Sinatra, but to give Brando his due he sang well and carried of the role brilliantly...like wise only a mad man will say Sinatra is a better actor than Brando.

Guys and Dolls is a very important film in Brando's career. It is the first light hearted movie he made. All his movies before this were heavy dramatic stuff. This is the first movie where Brando is having fun and what fun it was.

Great songs, great acting and great stars...GUYS and DOLLS is 4 star entertainment all the way.

Brando and Simmons along with Sinatra and Blaine are amazing.

I really liked this film.  Before Michael Moore became a liberal celebrity, he was a completely obscure magazine writer and filmmaker.  This film was a major underground hit at the time, and it still is excellent today.  You really feel for the people who lose their jobs, and you're infuriated by the callous indifference of Roger Smith and the management of General Motors.  I really liked the segment where Flint tries to reinvent itself as tourist mecca of the Midwest.  It consisted of a horribly misguided attempt at opening up a Hilton in downtown Flint, and opening up a theme park called Auto World.  It justs smacks of desperation and stupidity; it has make you laugh and grimace at the same time.  Instead of giving these people really good jobs again, they come up with this idiotic scheme, which ended up in disaster (both the Hilton and Auto World closed within a year).  Moore in recent years has become a "political celebrity", in that politics has become quite the cottage industry in America.  It's not just Moore doing it; right wingers like Hannity and Coulter have been doing it too.  They all got books; some of them got films; some of them have radio shows.  A lot of them aren't really interested in changing anything, as it might interfere with their livelihoods.  I don't know if Moore is like that or not.  But this is still a potent, darkly funny film about real class warfare, and the dismantling of the working class in America.

I actually didn't mind Kiss The Girls because of Morgan Freeman. He saved the day in that movie. Plus, I'm always intrigued by serial killers and weird psychos. That always peaks my interest. But Ashley Judd's performance was just terrible in that (not that I think she's very good in anything I've seen but whatever). That's why I was delighted to find another thriller along those lines with Morgan Freeman, still playing Alex Cross, but thankfully without Ashely Judd (a better name for her would be Ashely Dudd but that's my opinion). Along Came A Spider was not only an interesting storyline, it was also very well acted. There's some twists of course which I won't spoil, but one I did see coming and the other blindsided me. All in all very enjoyable, especially for the low price I found this at. The little girl who is kidnapped in this, played by Mika Boorem, is terrific. It was kind of neat seeing her in this as I had just watched the movie Sleepover recently (also reviewed it...cute little movie...check it out) where she's more grown up. Hopefully we'll be seeing more things with her. Anyway, I found this engrossing enough and most times you can't go wrong with Morgan Freeman (except if Ashely Judd is in a scene with him, but that's not his fault) as he's an exceptional actor. Obsessed with serial killers, psychos and the like, just as I am? Then you will have a good time getting tangled up in the web of Along Came A Spider

A film that's a little like trying to find your way out of a house of mirrors or an attempt to reassemble an  image once it has been split by a prism. Since nothing is as it seems, we may as well be inside a fictionalized world; like the Unicorn story the main character, Cathryn, is writing. This fantasy is read aloud throughout the film creating a framework whose only relevance to the story unfolding, is to reassure us that we have stepped into a world that is a creation of the imagination; however, the fact that is comes from the mind of a schizophrenic is hardly reassuring. A glance at the cast of characters hints that they are not necessarily who or what they seem (Hugh is played by Rene, Rene is played by Marcel who is played by Hugh. Cathryn is played by Susannah and Susannah plays Cathryn). Insanity is not an ordering principle of the mind, but rather a vain attempt to put order to an ever-changing palette of images that may or may not be reflections of images within the mind instead of outside. A very atmospheric film made more so by the disturbing score that is not altogether in sync with the action, another technique that constantly keeps the viewer off balance

I enjoy all three of the the Jurassic Park movies, though I think &quot;The Lost World&quot; is a bit weak.  While I think that anyone who enjoys action movies, monster movies, or horror movies should own all three, I find it difficult to recommend this set because there is a set that contains not only the three movies, but a fourth DVD containing substantial background information on the making of the movies.  I give this collection four stars only because the larger, more comprehensive collection is available and if you liked the first two, you will definitely like the third movie

I can't wait to see the original film again. I remember seeing the lemmings plunging into the sea. Thus was born the inspiration for the great PC game, Lemmings. Yes, I know that the lemmings were 'manipulated' into suicide. Nevertheless I love this movie. I hope that they don't cut the lemming sequence. Disney has promised a full restoration. Other animals that left a strong impression on me were the musk oxen in a circle being blasted with an Arctic blizzard. The hardships of an Arctic existence were beautifully photographed

This is a great show and very entertaining.  The story isn't the Greek classic, but it's a fine riff on it.  The songs are good, and they grow on you as you watch.  I take issue with the reviewer who thought there was gratuitous sexuality in the Meg character - it's just a cartoon, for pete's sake.

Like some other reviewers, I was also annoyed with Michael Bolton singing "Go The Distance" over the end credits, but this DVD has a music video of the Spanish language version, "No Importa La Distancia," sung by Ricky Martin, and it is killer!  This one is well worth the money

The direction of this film is excellent.  I love all the characters and the way they interact.  The storyline is very important also.  It's about religious beliefs and neighbors that interact with each other.  It's a well-paced and interesting story that's not like anything else I've ever seen.

SCRUBS has been a model of consistency in its five seasons--and to interrupt myself, why aren't we anticipating Season Five instead of Season Four? And boo! on them for being so slow to bring the show out on DVD!--and Season Four is no exception. I recently rewatched Seasons 1 through 3 on DVD with my daughter and it really brought home just how great this series has been from the very beginning to the present. If you visit boards there are always prognosticators who declare that it isn't as good as it used to be, but I would be dishonest if I said that I detected any decline. One thing I've really enjoyed is that unlike situation comedies, this one really does have an overall story arc, and I really appreciate Bill Lawrence and Co. taking the time to reward fans of the show in this way. 

The story in Season Four revolves largely around the very, very gradual repair of the friendship between JD and Elliott. Fans of the show know that at the end of Season Three JD, utterly smitten by Elliott, had expressed his love for her, causing her to break off her relationship with her boyfriend to be with JD. No sooner had he done this, however, he once again felt trapped and almost immediately broke things off with her. Season Four opens with her filled with hatred of him, complicated by the fact that she and he are named co-chief residents (though there is wonderful confusion over the fact that the name plate on her door reads--thanks to Janitor--"Chief Resident" and his misleadingly reads "Co-Chief Resident," causing many to imagine that she is over him). Some of my favorite visuals in the series are of JD and Elliott wedged into their ultra tiny office, barely large enough for the desk they face each other across. Of course, eventually they patch things up, but for the first season have no kind of romantic entanglement. Given the intensity of the events of the ends of Season Three, any sort of getting together would certainly have ended with Elliott murdering JD. The season ends with Carla and Turk urging JD to move out and get a place of his own, which leads to an interesting roommate situation in Season Five. 

Season Four continued the SCRUBS tradition of having some very high profile guest stars. This was marred somewhat by having the absolutely dreadful Colin Farrell on one episode, an episode through which he drifted as if completely drunk or totally bored (there have been very few bad episodes of SCRUBS, but this episode ranks near the bottom). The always delightful Heather Graham sparkled through several episodes earlier in the season. Matthew Perry stopped by for an episode less interesting for his presence than for his being teamed with his father, Jonathan Bennett Perry, a country singer best known to most people as the Old Spice sailor. Tara Reid puts in another appearance as JD's terrible sometimes girlfriend while Molly Shannon is in another episode. And Julianna Margulies of ER appears in a couple of episodes. 

The great tragedy with SCRUBS is that it remains something of a secret. The only comedy better than SCRUBS in the past few years has been ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT (most fans of one show tend to be a fan of the other as well, and the lead of each show appeared on the other, Zach Braff as the producer of the GIRLS WITH LOW SELF-ESTEEM series of videos on AR and Jason Bateman as a patient on SCRUBS) and while it won a large number of awards, its ratings were worse than SCRUBS. This show has decent ratings, but shockingly few awards. How terrible shows like EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND and the formerly good but now dull WILL AND GRACE beat it out for awards is mystifying. And how did it manage only one Emmy nomination? It was nominated for Best Comedy Series, but why wasn't Zach Braff nominated for Best Comic Actor and John C. McGinley and Donald Faison for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series and Sarah Chalke for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series? How is that possible? Much ink has been spilt on how the 2006 Emmy nominations have made less sense than any in memory (Lauren Graham yet again not nominated, though clearly the best comic actress on TV for at least five years and five vastly less talented women were nominated instead of her; LOST not nominated; no nominations for VERONICA MARS; Jason Lee not nominated for MY NAME IS EARL; neither Michael Chiklis, Hugh Laurie, nor James Gandolofini nominated for Best Actor, while Martin Sheen who was barely appeared in this year's WEST WING; while shows way, way, way, way past their prime like WILL AND GRACE and THE WEST WING nominated; and the list goes on) but Zach Braff's failure to be nominated while Charlie Sheen and Kevin James did is just one more reason not to take the Emmys seriously at all. At least the Golden Globes more or else get it right. 

Anyway, awards aside, and armed with the knowledge that the best shows are usually neglected by the Emmys (how many Emmy nods did BUFFY get despite most of the nation's best TV critics passionately begging each year for it to get the recognition it deserved), fans of the show will be delighted with Season Four and if you aren't a fan, you should be. But don't start with Season Four. Go back and do it right. Either buy or rent (I recommend buying--you'll want to watch this more than once) Season One, then work your way forward. Many pleasurable hours will result

I recently had a baby boy, and felt a &quot;little&quot; out of shape after having him(HA!)I did a search on amazon and found this video. I got it in 3 days, and began right away. My son works out with me every day, and I couldn't be happier! We both have fun doing the exercises which work my whole body, and I use him for the weights!I am also learning about my baby's development from the video. It's educational and rewarding. Thanks MBBB

Finally, an ab video that makes sense and works.  This video is truly innovative and unique.  Imagine having rock hard abs and great core strength without doing a sit up or a crunch.  You have to see it to believe it!  Mike Griffith makes this video fun, easy to follow, and very challenging for the beginner or most conditioned athlete.  With a short amount of time and minimal equipment, this program will stretch and strenghten your abs in a functional way.  I am a physical therapist and I use these techniques for patients with back pain as well as for performance improvement for athletes.  I have been using it myself, and it works

I really enjoyed this DVD-and all of the combos were doable with great breakdowns.

The instructor actually starts with the left foot , so you can follow her mirror image.

I teach dance and will definately use a lot of these moves.

And, you will work up a sweat, if you want more just do jumping jacks or run when they march.  Enjoy

Following the series of Firefly, Serenity continues the story line for a few  more steps.  There are so many ways this movie is packed I cannot begin to properly mention them here.  The storyline is woven to present images not so much out of sequence but in a "solving the mystery" approach.  The english language used presents a plausible development that on first viewing is not difficult to follow or understand- mostly through common word usage that is more and more endearing with subsequent viewing.  The animations are first rate and contribute to an unbelievably real quality.  The characters are complex, focused, solid and believable from the way they are unchanging in their demeanor in all situations.  The challenges the crew of Serenity face are many: from their interactions with unsavory underworld bosses while earning money for survival to avoiding authority "Alliance" forces to the overt mortal threat of the "Reavers".  The climax builds to the end revealing some things while setting the stage for the story to continue.  The music in Serenity contributes to the experience leaving me wanting more.  I suggest seeing the series Firefly before watching the movie Serenity to fully understand and grasp the nuances of the characters

My wife and I, huge fans of `America's Next Top Model' and `Project Runway', were very excited about seeing this film.  Why it took us this long still baffles me, but as of Friday night we had the pleasure of seeing `The Devil Wears Prada' and let me just say that it was quite the pleasure.  Now, most if not all the praise has been heaped on the shoulders of Meryl Streep, and while she was outstanding, this film is more than just a Meryl painted canvas.  There are four brilliant performances in this film and they all are deserving of praise.

First is Anne Hathaway who plays Andrea Sachs, a young aspiring journalist who takes a job working as Miranda Priestly assistant at `Runway Magazine'.  Anne Hathaway proves with her performance that she's all grown up.  No, that's not to take away from her more adult roles in more adult films like `Havoc' and the masterpiece `Brokeback Mountain', but here Anne proves that she can do adult comedy, not falling back into her teen goofiness that made her famous in `The Princess Diaries' but keeping everything smart and mature.  She has enough poise and grace to match wits with Miranda, and she does so elegantly.

Next up is Emily Blunt who plays Emily, Miranda's first assistant (there are two, Andrea being the second).  Emily has worked her butt off to get to where she is, slaving for the unruly Priestly and it's all about to pay off with a trip alongside Miranda to Paris.  The only thing standing in her way is Andrea, for if Andrea fails miserably then it reflects poorly on Emily.  Emily Blunt turns out I think the best performance of the bunch for she has enough sass, enough attitude and enough wit to make her pop out from the screen and stand out no matter who is sharing the screen with her.

Stanley Tucci also does wonderfully here as Nigel, Miranda's second in command.  He is there to make sure everything is perfect, and also help Andrea adjust.  Stanley always has done great backup work, playing second hand man to just about everyone, but here he really makes his performance his own and owns it.  He delivers some of the funniest lines in the film but he never feels like the `token gay guy'...he's needed in this film, not filler, and he commands his scenes and really stands out amidst the crowd.

And then, of course, we have Meryl Streep who plays the ruthless tyrant known as Miranda Priestly.  What I was most impressed about was the way Meryl underplays every word, every emotion, every scene, which is not what I expected.  I really expected her to go all Glen Close and reincarnate Cruella but she didn't (thankfully) and instead turned out one of the most inspired performances of the year.  She must have had fun playing the snooty self absorbed and above all selfish editor-in-chief of `Runway'.  She lets us see inside her character briefly (when crying over another failed marriage) but her character is more about shutting off feeling in order to succeed and so we don't get to see the real Miranda because we're not supposed to.

Carried by these four brilliant performances `The Devil Wears Prada' is a fabulous film that will make you laugh and make you smile and will impress almost anyone.  The script is brilliantly adapted from Lauren Weisberger's novel, and while it's not an exact replica (are any adaptations these days?) it carries the same wit but smoothes things out to make it more approachable and, in my eyes, more enjoyable.  Bravo

I've been doing this DVD workout for two years, and I still can't make it all the way through the "level 2" workouts.  This video is incredibly challenging, but I like that I can do the "level 1" workouts and have the goal of making it to the next level one day.  No other DVD can accomplish what Tamilee does in 15 minutes.  This really makes me value how efficient she is at giving you exercises that are really challenging and in a short amount of time.  I am always sore the next day when I do her workouts.  This is a great DVD

A hardcore legend in Mick Foley' wrestling career is spotlighted here on this DVD.  Foley will go down in history for being able to control the crowd, being violent & hardcore, and also being able to be one of the most loveable characters in wrestling.  This DVD is a great collection of violent matches involing Foley himself along with his famous promos & extra matches.

Disc One:
Cactus Jack vs. Big Van Vader - During a time where Vader was just killing his opponetts, Cactus Jack was able to hold his own and go toe to toe with Vader.  This also includes exclusive footage that was censored on TBS.

Chicago Street Fight: Cactus Jack & Maxx Payne vs. Nasty Boys - This was one of the "stiffest" matches I've ever seen as these guys were legitlity brawling & hitting each other with the weapons and you just see at one point Cactus get his head cracked with a shovel on the floor.  Honestly, one of the best Nasty Boys matches I've seen.

Cactus Jack vs. Sabu - This match was more about the post match brawl between the two than the match itself.  Foley admits before the match that the hype & reputation between these two set a standard that nobody could match.

Cactus Jack vs. Chris Candido - One of Cactus's best "wrestling" matches eventhough it's not really anything memorable.

Texas Death Match: Cactus Jack vs. The Sandman - Foley openily admits that this match wasn't pretty as Sandman got a concussion at the beginning & really threw everything off.  They would go on to have better matches (as seen on the ECW Cactus Jack DVD).

Cactus Jack & Raven vs. Terry Funk & Tommy Dreamer - The classic ECW wild weapons brawl as they had everything including the kitchen sink.  It would get sick as you see things like Cactus sliceing Funk's arm with glass.  With cameo's from Taz & Bill Alfonzo, this is worth watching again & again.

Cactus Jack vs. Mikey Whipwreck - Cactus' last match in ECW against the man he helped make a superstar.

Disc 1 Extras:
Post-Vader match interview - Interview a week after his match with Vader

Falls Count Anywhere: Cactus Jack vs. Sting - This match has commentary from Coach & Foley where they talked about his storytelling throughout the match & his time in WCW.  This was Cactus' best WCW match in his opinion and it really is.  Action all over the ringside area along with great inring storytellin (watch him work on Sting's ribs).

Cactus Jack spits on WCW Tag Team Championship belt - The promo Cactus did after this Sabu match showing that the WCW Tag Title didn't mean as much as his pride that he lost to Sabu.  This is followed by a Heyman promo regarding that match.

The "Cane Dewey" Promo - Foley's favorite promo done during this "anti-hardcore" stint in ECW where he talks about the fans making a sign suggesting that Sandman canes his 5 year old son.

"Anti-Hardcore" promo - Another promo where Foley talks down to the ECW fans for being so bloodthirsty.

Cactus Jack vs. Sabu - The Cactus/Sabu rematch that includes commentary from Foley & Coach.  This match is better quality (both in video & in ring action) than the previous one.

Mick Foley's ECW Farewell Speech - Foley says goodbye to the ECW fans.

"Jack"" Foley & Les Thornton vs. British Bulldogs - Mick's WWE debut that results in his having a dislocated jaw thanks to the Dynamite Kid.

WWE Confidential feature - Mick talks about all the charity work he did during his 18 month absence in WWE and what led to his coming back to WWE.

Hidden Easter Eggs:
Mick Foley jumps off the roof of his house (On disc one, go to the "Extras" menu, highlight "Main Menu" and press the left arrow twice.)

Dude Love Entrance Video (On disc one, go to the "Chapters" menu.  Highlight "Cactus Jack vs. Chris Candido" and press the right arrow.)

Disc 2
Introducting Mankind - One of the Mankind "dungeon" promos he did before his debut

Mankind vs. Shawn Michaels - This was Foley's best match of his career and probably the best match of 1996.  HBK's high flyin' lucha libre influenced style mixed with Mankind's hardcore daredevil style made for one hell of a match.

Falls Count Anywhere: Cactus Jack vs. Triple H - Tables, trash cans, and weapons galore in this brawl.  One of the best matches in RAW history
 
Mick Foley vs. Terry Funk - A throwback to their ECW brawls as both of these wrestlers are just using their own bodies are wrecking machines.  Stone Cold on commentary just adds to the craziness of this match.

Dude Love vs. Stone Cold - The best match in the history of Dude Love as it's another brawl all over ringside.  McMahon, Brisco, Patterson, and Undertaker all have cameos in this match.

Mankind vs. The Undertaker - Foley's most memorable performance as he takes a beating that you have to see to believe.

Mankind vs. The Rock - Foley wins the title for the first time with help from Stone Cold.  This match itself isn't as memorable as their Survivor Series match or their later matches like the Halftime Heat match.

Street Fight Match: Cactus Jack vs. Triple H - This is the match that catapulted Triple H into the bonified main event superstar that he is today.  Thumbtacks, barbed wire, and blood all over the place.

Disc 2 Extras: 
Mankind teasers - Early Mankind promos that focued on his missing ear

Music To My Ear - Another Mankind "dungeon" promo

Mind Games - This was a promo Mankind did before the Mind Games PPV where he insulted ECW (they were in Philidelphia) to insure the fans wouldn't cheer him.

Jim Ross interviews Mankind - This was the interview that slowly started Mankind's face turn.

The Birth of Mr. Socko - Mankind visits Mr. McMahon in the hospital

Mick and Al Snow in Vegas - They're stalked by a fan 

More Mick and Al in Vegas - Mick and Al ride the rides, join a lounge band and visit a gentleman's club 

Commissioner Foley & Kurt Angle - The Commish books a match 

Hidden Easter Eggs:
Chef Boyardee commercial (On disc two, on the "Chapters" menu, highlight "Shawn Michaels vs. Mankind" and press the left arrow twice.)

DX skit "Have A Bad Day" (On disc two, on the "Extras" menu, highlight "Birth of Mr. Socko" and press the right arrow twice.) 

HIGHLY RECOMMENDE

I just can't say enough good things about the Brainy Baby series of videos and toys.  I have allowed my baby to watch one Brainy Baby video per day since he was about 6 months old.  He loves them.  And I love being able to have a few minutes to clean my kitchen.  :)  As soon as the Brainy Baby theme music comes on he starts to smile.  He is captivated.  I like them much more than the Baby Einstein videos.  

And the toys.......he LOVES them.  "Hello, Brainy Baby!"  They are the most loved and most used toys in his toy box.  I have to keep an extra stash of batteries just to make sure that they are all working all the time.  

We love Brainy Baby at our house.

Wow, I just viewed "Spun" the other night and I thought this movie was outrageous. This is sort of a guilt-pleasure movie but you want to take shower afterwards.

 "Spun" has an impressive cast of recognized actors. The film is, essentially, about a few days in the lives of a group of drug addicts. There is The Cook (Mickey Rourke, he truly makes this story worth watching), who makes the drug (speed) and sells it to Spider Mike (John Leguizamo), a dealer with a junkie girlfriend, Cookie (Mena Suvari, looking infinitely less attractive than she did in "American Beauty"). One of his clients is Ross (Jason Schwartzman), who does a lot of favours for The Cook and his girlfriend, Nikki (Brittany Murphy). 

 I was surprised at how funny the film was at times. It doesn't drown us in anti-drug messages, nor does it become one of those, equally tedious, drug films where you feel like the sober driver at a drunken party. The humour is dark, certainly, but funny nevertheless. A lot of it comes from a subplot about Frisbee, Patrick Fugit,  who is caught by a couple of TV policemen (Peter Stormare and Alexis Arquette) and is told he will be let off if he helps them get Spider-Mike. I will only say of the resulting sequence that he does it with all the subtlety of an undercover policeman with his badge stuck to his forehead.

This is a film with a lot of energy, that seems, like its characters, not entirely sure where it is going, but determined to get there, and quickly. Although I am sure it is boring to be surrounded by people on speed when you are sober, this film almost makes you feel like you are on speed too. The director, Jonas ï¿½kerlund, has directed music videos in the past, and it shows in his impatient filming style, as he plays around with animation, speeded-up camerawork and such like.

I'm not recommending the film for its style though, although I am sure it is the best way this material could get to the screen. I am recommending it because I liked the main characters, which I think will stick in my head for much longer than the animated sex scenes or the split screens. I can imagine an entire film about The Cook and Nikki, or Spider Mike and Cookie, or even just Ross, who absentmindedly keeps leaving a girl handcuffed to his bed for hours/days. What makes "Spun" better than those hypothetical films is that it puts the characters into their own little community, and we feel as if we are watching their everyday, speeded up, sleepless lives. Simply amazing.

<review_text>
Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now is a pure example of method filmmaking. It is the true craftmanship of an essential filmmaker. The art direction, editing and sound effects are partially a small fragment which makes this film classical and memorable. What drives the integrity and semblance of the film is the storyline, acting and inner message. The inner message evidently enough is that war is hell, or in other words, hell is war. Not many directors have the ambition or the true courage to establish such a well-defined piece of art. European filmmakers wouldn't have the slightest problem of directing the film or throw in their personal feelings about the war. What is most interesting is that an American filmmaker spoke his style and the style of the film's collaborators through the continuance of the film.

The plot is fairly simple and brief, adapted by Joseph Conrad's Heart Of Darkness. Martin Sheen plays the role of Captain Willard, a war-torn character who does not see any hope in life or humanity anymore. He has a mission and it is to capture a presumed Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who has fabricated an army of existensial soldiers on the outskirts of the Cambodian jungle. Throughout the film we encounter astonishing sequences. The most unforgettable is the dawn helicopter attacks. Robert Duvall's character Colonel Kilgore is a steady and firm example of the basic American army brain: to search and destroy and then destroy some more if it includes yourself. The children walk about the playground, oblivious to any danger. The helicopters come into view from the dawning sea; millions of sprinkle reflect from the water, we hear the helicopter's engines roar from the horizon and soon enough we are stuck in a messy attack. Throughout the sequence we hear Wagner's 'Ride Of The Valkyries'. It is method filmmaking. The starting sequence is as fascinating as the rest of the movie; a beautiful scene of palm trees blowing in the ragged wind and seconds away from being inflamed with a carpet bombing. Let's not forget the scene where the soldiers of the boat in which Sheen travels in, stop an innocent upcoming boat, suspecting them to be VietCongs and carrying artilleries. Then they spark off a heavy scene of shooting in which all of the passengers of the boat are pulverised to pieces with their crops and food savaged in the atrocity.

This film has its famous moment, some better to be kept quiet about until they come through the screen. It doesn't require any intellectual understanding, although the film is intellectually remarkable. The American soldiers in the Vietnam War jumped into the land of a fresh governmental country, aiming to protect themselves and in the end only received death and chaos for their troops and for the majority of the country they were fighting against. It was a war gone mad, like all other wars, without purpose or dignity. It was a pure act of humanity: to destroy and restore their own greedy needs. This is a film in which there is no saviour, where it is hardly possible to find hope in the gloomiest corners and where all surroundings are plagued with the infatuations of greed, anger, foolishness and egoism. As Coppola once said about the film: 'This film isn't about Vietnam. This film IS Vietnam'. He was right to the date. During the current situations of the world, where they are trying to protect their own skin, the world should try to analyse this film as much as possible and wonder about what it is trying to represent. It is a film which does not ask for applause or damnation. It asks for realism.

Enjoy

I watched this dvd in one of my classes and it left me feeling hoplessly hopeless!

I really dont know what to think about the whole presentation. The presence of Chomsky makes it look reputable but who knows, he might have been taken out of context although it seemed not. 

If what they claim about corporations is true, then we are getting ready to implode in one way or another.I'll keep away from political lines and just suggest that you watch it and decide...

I had given it a rating of 3 but just changed it to 4. The material is more plausible than otherwise

I love this film, beautifully simple and human. The characters are real; flawed yet somehow you find sympathy for them- just like your own family. I've rented at least fifteen times, and I never get bored of it. It's great any time of year, but fantastic for the holidays

It's not a conflict of good and evil that drives MILLIONS (Fox), but rather issues of what's right and wrong.

Set in the UK, this exquisite family film about two brothers, serious seven year old Damien and fun-loving nine year Anthony, who recently lost their mom and discover a suitcase full of British Pounds has dropped out of the sky and crashed into their playhouse.  And it's only seven days before the official currency switches to Euros.  

The brothers think it came from God and they have differing agendas: Spend it on themselves or give it to the needy.  

But the money, on a train to incinerators, was tossed by crooks to accomplices and they want the missing bag back. Millions is funny, scary and profound.  You may even discover things about yourself you never before considered. 

Rated: PG.  Genre: Family Drama/Comedy.  1 Hour, 38 Minutes.  Starring: James Nesbitt, Daisy Donovan, Alex Etel, Lewis McGibbon.  Director: Danny Boyle.

This is a teen movie with the endless teen theme of boy seeking to get the goodies from the girl. It is better than the average for this genre due to several factors. Mostly, it is because is well done.

The subject matter lends itself to course treatment but that is not what is presented here. Instead, the situations are depicted with as much dignity as possible from hormone driven teenagers and is is presented with comedy.

The time of the film is the 50s. Society was more innocent back then but boys still had the same thing on their minds that they always have and always will. In this case, the school geek has a bad case for the school beauty queen. He is aided in his quest by the cool loner from out of town who has his own heart set on "the nice girl". Meanwhile, the unpopular girl has a bad case herself for the geek. 

The geek achieves his goal and learns that the decorative aspects of women sometimes cover up the less desirable traits. The loner finds that the nice girl really is a nice girl and that love is something special. The unpopular girl undergoes a hormone miracle and becomes a prize catch. Everyone winds up happy except the town bully/rich boy. It is simplistic in its portrayal but no less appealing for that.

Kelly Preston plays the beauty queen and she really is the stuff of dreams until the wrapper comes off. Doug McKeon plays the geek who becomes a prize himself. Catherine Mary Stewart is the nice girl that I wish had lived next door to me and Jami Gertz is the metamorphosed hormone miracle. The cast is rounded out by Chris Nash. Each does a good job in the role. Teen angst comes to the fore and a worthwhile story actually results. 

It was fun and bittersweet in the memories it conjured.

If your a Pacino fan this is for you one of his earlier films
This deals with a lawyer not a crooked lawyer but a good mostly honest lawyer and all the things that a lawyer has goon through or could go through this is a instant classic and the story to the movie is excellent 

Highly recomende

This has to be the best of the Alien films! This film, although not as scary as the original (I mean that it did not scare me as much as Alien), it is much more exciting and enjoyable than the first. Also, this would have been an ideal conclusion to the series. Go on, buy the Collector's Edition of the first and this and enjoy

I really enjoyed this film, basically the Coen Bros. homage to the film noir genre. (I always thought the name was funny, since it's French, and yet most of famous directors were German, like Fritz Lang, Otto Preminger, etc. :-)). The sure hand of the brothers with this material is shown in how the film unfolds with the cool, unhurried, nonchalant pace of an experienced private eye or gumshoe doggedly stalking his prey. Thornton is great in the lead as the reticent, phlegmatic barber, and if anything, he is even more convincing with hair than without--even his hairpiece is 50s-ish. :-) The whole cast does a fine job in their roles, and both Gandolfini and Shaloub  have a couple of show-stealing scenes. I found the film's climax a complete surprise, as the tables turn unexpectedly on the barber, for whom everything seems to be working out up till then. Overall a great film and probably one of the Coen Bros. best. If you're a Coen Bros. fan you won't find this one a disappointment.

Sorry, after reading some negative reviews I just had to speak up.  This movie was one of the best movies I have ever seen.  I still to this day watch it over and over again.  Well directed, some of the best acting I have seen, and my god the cast in this movie, the list of stars is endless.  The courtroom scenes were so intense, I envey anyone who has not seen this yet.  The story was perfect and so many surprises and turns.  Really well done.  This movie is worth every penny, I just wish I would of got to see it in the movies.  It is the most powerful movie I have ever seen, how can anyone say this movie was not good, I guess they just can't handle the truth..

Nowadays, Hollywood just wouldn't have the balls to make a film that spits in the face of terrorism, unless it was an easy target that doesn't spit back (aka, America and it's 1st Amendment).  This film harkens back to the day when people wished our country's foreign policy was a bit more leathery.  Well...ya got it now!  At the very least, a film like this would piss off the surrender-monkeys in the jackass party, not only for what they would see as a glorification of nationalistic jingoism, but for the villification and slaughter of Stalinistic, Castro-like communists that they would only want to capitulate and make peace with.  Makes one wonder if the lefty Glenn Close now hates herself for acting in such a film.  What would they say to a film like this?  Unfortunately, there's plenty of room for criticism in this movie, aside from the political implications therein.  Some (arguably, if not all) of the special effects seemed a bit hokey (hence the 4 stars instead of the five).  I think if anyone wanted to be bipartisan about anything, it would have to be the 90's style CGI, especially the plane crash.  At best, one might go so far as to say it was "cute."  And what can a guy like me say to that?  Even as I write this review, scarcely 2 days have past from the red letter day in the struggle against terrorism, in which the ruthless terrorist leader of al Qaida in Iraq, al-Zarqawi, caught himself a couple of 500 lb. bombs with the use of his house.  For those who want to keep westerners depressed and demoralized (not a far stretch from "fear-mongering," right?) in the fight against terrorism, this deals a disappointing blow to those who hate America.  What's worse, they can't seem to ban a film exalting American nationalism such as "Air Force One" from those who wish to see it (oh no!).  And just 2 years ago the same whiners were bitching about "The Passion."  Sucks to have the 1st amendment apply to every American and not just the idealistic "intellectual" few, doesn't it

"Above the Rim" is an entertaining street drama that focuses around Kyle Lee Watson, an inner-city high school basketball player who shows a lot of promise but lets his own arrogance get the best of him.  He won't listen to anybody who offers him advice on how to improve his game, as he thinks that he is the best player ever.  He's been hoping that his mad skills are catching a college scout's attention, but he does catch Birdie's eyes when he plays.  Birdie is a well known gang leader who offers Kyle the good life so long as he plays on his neighborhood team in a "Shoot-Out" basketball contest that means the world to him.  Kyle--being impatient as ever--agrees to join, not seeing the clear danger that is in front of him.  A high school security guard with a past knows the danger that Birdie presents, and he is the only who has a chance to get through to Kyle before it is too late.

Not only is this a very good basketball movie, but it is also an intense and character-driven drama centered around the choices that we make in life... and how we have to live with them in the long run.  The film has some great performances from Duane Martin, Marlon Wayans and the late Tupac Shakur.  Even though everybody is great in their roles, the showstopper is indeed Shakur.  He gives a very masterful performance that really sticks out and will stay with you long after the movie is over.  My only complaint is the length of the movie.  It's true that a movie that runs a little over an hour and a half isn't short, but I think the story and the characters open more possibilities to add on to the movie.  I think more opportunities and risks could have been taken to further enrich the story.  Still, it is a really good movie that didn't disappoint me.

The DVD doesn't have a whole lot to offer.  You can either watch the movie in widescreen or in fullscreen, depending on your preference.  The movie looks and sounds very good.  The only special features that are offered are movie trailers, and those aren't even that great.  I would've loved it if they included the music video, "Regulate" by Warren G and Nate Dogg.  In fact, given some of the great rap songs that are in this movie, they could've included a couple of music videos.  It's not a great DVD, but at least it's not that expensive.

I really enjoyed "Above the Rim."  It may not be flawless, but it definitely does more right than wrong.  The characters are what really dominate the movie.  Even if you're not a fan of the game, it's still something to check out if you're a fan of character drama.  Exciting, intense, conflict-driven and full of heart, "Above the Rim" is a very well done film. -Michael Cran

Fast Times at Ridgemont High is a clever, insightful, and wicked film! It is not just another teen movie, though to the casual observer it might be. No, it is a time capsule into the SoCal lifestyle that pervaded much of the films of the late 70's and 80's as well as it is a time capsule into the mindset of teenagers all over the U.S. circa 1982.

Sean Penn (whom I'm not a big fan of) as Jeff Spicoli is truly inspired! I find myself to this day trying to imitate his dead on surfer takes. What an awesome character. When he says, "You d*ck!" to Ray Walston's Mr. Hand (another inspired and forever memorable character), you just wanna roll on the floor!

Jennifer Jason Leigh is nicely sweet and innocent as a junior high girl struggling with sexuality. Phoebe Cates as the girl who believes herself to be in the only truly "mature" relationship anyone has (with a college boy) is fresh and believable. Judge Reinhold as Leigh's older brother is inspired.
Mike Damone is a sleaze and a great character (if only he really believed in himself as much as he wants others to).

In fact, this film boasts huge numbers of young actors who went on to become stars. The script by a very young Cameron Crowe is brilliant!

Fast Times came out at roughly the same time as The Last American Virgin and several years after Rock and Roll High School. Neither of those other films is anywhere on par with Fast Times. At times, light and airy, Fast Times carries a serious "message" that teen agers are truly finding their way in life in the best way they know how. It is somewhat inspired that we never actually see the parents of any of the kids in the film. The adults we see are those with whom they interact with outside the home: truly, teenagers feel that their young lives are more affected by people other than their parents.

While Last American Virgin approached some of the same topics that Fast Times does, it did it in a more sinister way. Fast Times doesn't gloss over teen age problems, but puts them in perspective of how the teenager his/herself deals with them.

Yes, it's a comedy and yes it is funny, but it is not just a film for kids

I have loved thie movie ever since seeing it on late night tv. I had to search a long time to find it on video before dvd was an option and I have been waiting impatiently for release on dvd since my vhs is wearing out. The gradual awakening of young Ta to which girl is truly right for him and Sammy Fong's attempt to disillusion his picture bride are priceless although the latter was often cut out  during late night broadcasts. The ballet is sublime even though you can tell when they switched from James Shigeta to a professional dancer. Afterall, it's the music and the story that make this great.

That is what this film meant to me, looking at the kaleidiscope of life as it passes by, so sweet, so unsatisfying at times yet so perfect when the right person is there.

This film is a poem to Paris and the passing of youth, with the hope of recapturing that one love, which when found engraves itself so deeply that it is like a hinge in the mind, always present, always remembered, always desired.  

The two lovers meet, seemingly a lifetime away from when they met by chance on a train, and with instant rapport they tell eachother in the space of a few hours everything that happened since they met 10 years earlier.    They see how much they meant to eachother, how much they still could, like two pieces of a puzzle that fit.  

This is a genuinely beautiful film, more mature than the last one, much sadder and in many ways better and more realistic.  It opened that sense of mystery that I have known, in life and its surprises and potential in the luck of finding true intimacy.  

Julie Delphy is one of those rare women who gets more beautiful as she ages.  She has become a sad person, stalled in relationships, though she is living up to her ideals.  Ethan Hawke is struggling to grow with his success, in a down phase of his marriage and needing their friendship very badly.  Their relationship, so brief, rings totally true, in its humor, commitment, and occasional awkwardness.  

Perhaps this is sentimental, but I think I have known love like this.  It is an image more in my mind than the person perhaps, but our friendship is as deep as it was when we met nearly 35 years ago.  Some people simply pierce thru to the heart, earning a permanent place no matter who they later marry or what they become.  It is an extraordinary sympathy for one another that is beyond sex (well, maybe not too far beyond...).

Highest recommendation.  This succeeds brilliantly at a snapshot in time, with an entire history implied behind it, like the greatest art.  And I do think that the ending is ambiguous and must be interpreted, which is also so very much like real life

It is the declining days of the Great War (WWI), the Germans are leaving a small French town but are leaving a little present for the advancing British troops.  They have buried the munitions in the town square.  When the town hall clerk strikes midnight the bomb will be exploded.  The town's people evacuate.  During this the barber sends off a message to the British.

The British decide to send a man to check this out.  They choose the bumbling Scottish Private Plumpick (Alan Bates).  Located on the outskirts of town is an asylum.  The sisters who run the asylum escape with the town's people, leaving the inmates to fend for themselves.  They return to the town, resuming their lives before being commited.

Plumpick arrives in town but doesn't know that the towns people are actually the lunatics from the asylum.  He meets the beautiful Coquelicat (Genevieve Bujold) and falls in love with her.  He finally puts everything together and defuses the bomb (of course it's more complex and hilarious than just that.)  He also finally puts together that there is something wrong with the town's people.  The funny part is he feels the lunatics have a better grasp on reality the sane people.  So shall he return to the war or stay with people he loves.

This is half fairy tale and half fable.  Alan Bates gives a great performance and Genevieve Bujold shows great whimsy.

THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS is Wes Anderson's third major motion picture.  The movie revolves around a rich, but extremely eccentric man name Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman).  Royal and his wife Etheline (Angelica Huston) had three children:  Chas (Ben Stiller), Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow), and Richie (Luke Wilson).  In the 1970s the Tenenbaums were one of America's premier families:  Margot was a famous playwright, Richie was a junior tennis champion who later won three consecutive U.S. Nationals, and Chas started his first real estate business at an early age earning himself his first million dollars before he was thirteen.  That was almost thirty years ago and the Tenenbaums have largely been forgotten.  Betrayal, failure, and disaster have haunted the family and the laurels of their youthful days have withered and died.  What's worse is that Royal's children and wife blame him for all their failures.  Royal senses that his time is Earth is waning and he wishes to set things right.  With the assistance of his faithful servant and lifelong friend, Pagoda (Kumar Pallana), Royal sets into motion a plan to redeem himself in his family's eyes.

I'm a pretty big fan of Wes Anderson and have seen all four of his films.  THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS is Anderson's most critically acclaimed and his most popular picture.  However, it is my least favorite of his movies.  Like all Anderson films the movie is filled with quirky characters and witty dialogue.  The film is about the redemption of a man in the eyes of his family, a theme that I enjoy.  Yet, the film just didn't resonate with me as much as Anderson's other pictures.  I really don't know why that is.  That's not to say THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS is a bad movie because it's not.  In addition to everything else mention it also has some good acting, brilliant set designs, etc.  I just prefer a movie about thieve brothers or a film about a precocious teenage genius or comic-drama about a sea-voyaging documentarian instead

The movie is a brillant mix of drama, love, and comedy. The casting was brillant with greats like Judd and Bullock.

In the movie we are introduced to Siddalee Walker a women who has made her mother Vivianne mad. Vivianne always seemed heartless and distant to Sidda and when Sidda tells a reporter about her mother some things get twisted out of proportion and printed the wrong way, which makes Vivi mad. Enter the Ya-Ya's three of Vivi's friends. They feel that Sidda should know the truth about her mother and maybe she would understand. So they kidnap Sidda and start to tell her about her mother. We learn that Vivi wasn't well liked by her own mother and was seen as a bad person by her mother. Then we learn that Vivi's first love whom she never got over was killed at war which is why she hates her husband. Sidda then starts to question her current realationship thinking she'll be a bad mother and calls off her wedding. Phase two of the Ya Ya's plan. They must tell Sidda something about her mother that will change everything.

Very good plot that will make you cry and laugh at the same time. This would be a good one to watch with friends or mothers.

When Once and Again first began I dismissed it as a show for just women. But after watching just one episode I found myself hooked. This was unlike any show I had seen before. I actually found myself drawn into the lives of these two families. Once and Again is not just a show about two divorced people who find each other and start to fall in love. It goes much deeper than that. Once and Again follows the lives of two divorced people and the lives of their children as well. But then it goes a step further and it follows the lives of their ex spouses as well. With the first season we see how the relationship begins to develop between Lily (Sela Ward) and Rick (Billy Campbell) and how their ex's still play a factor in their love lives and how their blossoming relationship has an effect on their children. Once and Again was one of the finest dramas on television and if given the respect it deserved could still be growing strong today. Even thought it's time on television was short Once and Again showcased the acting talents of Sela Ward and Billy Campbell and launched the careers of Shane West and Evan Rachel Wood. I am just glad that we are able to enjoy this fine show on DVD and that they have finally decided to release Seasons 2 and 3

This movie is full of memorable scenes, although it's probably been more than a decade since I last saw it.  It's suspenseful without being gory...the most memorable scene is one that is absolutely chilling without ever showing a drop of blood. And even though I'd read the book and knew the outcome I was on the edge of my seat right to the finish

This film is one of my all time favorites. I think it's because these kids remind me of my friends and I as kids - riding our  bikes, going on little adventures, etc. The cast is absolutely perfect. Wil Wheaton was the best crying kid of all time - with the exception of Ricky Schroeder in The Champ. LOL. River Phoenix was excellent in this film, which is an adaptation of a Stephen King short story. Part road film, part coming of age tale, all the elements are here to tug at your heart strings.

I like this movie.

A meeting happened in our life is very special and nearly miracle, but we don't think so almost always. The story except political things in this movie is thinkable around here.

Screenplay and performance of both Bill Nighy and Kelly McDonald have led this movie to the excellent one.

PS: I don't understand why this movie is not released in Japan

James, you wrote: "Ben is weak, immature, a stalker, lazy, has bad taste in women and at 21 is unable to tell his parents no when they ask him to wear a scuba suit for their family friends. Wow! Revolutionary film-making...not!"   Yes, Ben was weak, immature, and had bad taste in women. His learning to overcome his weakness, immaturity, bad taste in women, and then defy his family and Elaine's family was his coming of age story.  That WAS the point of the movie.  It went right over your head!  The acting was dead on and the subject matter was shocker when it came out!  How could you not love this movie?  Maybe you need to grow up a little to see the value.  Watch it again in a few years.  I think you will change your low opinion of this great classic movie over time.

Moving, intelligent, realistic, not overly acted (as could quite easily have been the case).

About a 20 year old who has gone off the rails to come back onto them again...you see why this has happened, feel sympathy, and just want him to do well when the film ends.

A story about hope, in a world with little..

One of the best-directed films of 2006, "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" is built for multiple viewings and perhaps for cult audiences.  

And even though "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" may require multiple viewings just to catch all of the rapid-fire dialogue, or to untangle the plot, one of the best reasons for multiple viewings is to admire the directorial skill:  It's a Class-A tutorial for amateur filmmakers or simply armchair film-buffs who will appreciate the highwire juggling act that Shane Black pulls off here, with "KKBB"'s sudden shifts of tone from slapstick to dead-serious drama to gallows-comedy.

If that seems like an easy feat, well... Remember "1941"?  Not even Spielberg got it right.  But Shane Black nails it here -- and it's his directorial debut.

Downey & Kilmer are also at the top of their game here, but it's Michelle Monaghan who impresses with a flat-out great performance that keeps up with the veterans.

"Sui Generis" (one-of-a-kind) is the phrase that best describes "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang," although it's remarkably mainstream at times.  It's a showcase of talents for everyone involved, and when the bullets aren't flying, there's even a romantic comedy here & social commentary to boot.  I can't think of any other film quite like it -- and that's just how the Warner Brothers tradition seems to work (at its best).

The folks at PBS deserve the gratitude of photography teachers and students everywhere. Taking on subject matter as impossibly broad as photography in 20th Century America? This documentary covers-- sometimes comprehensively, sometimes briefly-- virtually every important topic germane to the field of study, from Pictorialism to Straight Photography, from fashion to the scientific. Along the way, we are introduced (or reintroduced) to what has been the medium's most important uses: journalism and documentary. "A Century of Images" is as instructive for the novice as it may be reaffirming to those already familiar with much of the material. Underlying a wealth of historical examples and anecdotes are the two twin themes that raise this effort above the mundane: concern over the ethical issues photographs present, and the effects of mechanically produced images in the post-industrial age on the psyche of our nation. These themes manifest themselves in ways that are often revelatory and moving. One memorable example: the way Edward Curtis's images of Native Americans are placed into context by a woman who appreciates them, yet yearns for more images that show her people the way they "really were." Sections on war photography cover WWI, WWII, Vietnam and the Gulf War with compassion, and work as excellent visual aids to discussions on todays situation in Iraq. Another bonus: the section on the transition to a digital age has not yet outlived its usefulness.

Until I was able to buy this fabulous history on DVD, my biggest complaint was that while using the VHS version, I had all kinds of problems locating the various scenes I wanted to pull out to show my photography and visual communication courses at the university where I teach. Now that I can happily locate scenes at will using the DVD menu, I can direct my ire at its few but significant omissions and shortcomings. More on Walker Evans, Robert Frank, Diane Arbus please . . . . they were pretty damned influential.

This movie is funny and by being so bold in so many ways is refreshing.  It presents realistic characters without worrying about offending people by presenting sterotypes.  It takes the time to develope the story effectively without boring the audience.  It is a long movie but it moves at a great and effective pace.

It is full of laughs.  Joe Pesci is one of the best comic actors of all time.  I don't think that anyone else could have pulled of the part of Vinny nearly as well.  Marisa was great as well and it was hard to find a performance that was less than great.  The writing and directing, two things that often get overlooked, was wonderful.  The only weakness?  The case is a little fantastic.  It is hard to believe the coincidences in the movie that lead to the boys being accused of the crime.  Of course movie plots don't have to make perfect sense but this stretches it.  

Though I usually don't like excessive foul language, this movie uses it in a funny way.  I guess it wouldn't work without it...
but don't be mistaken....it has a lot of bad language.  Don't let kids under 17 watch it without supervision

I saw this flick when it first came out, and was chilled to the bone.  It was one of the movies that helped form my opinion about New York City, as well - as a cold, impersonal city where anonimity could swallow you up!

Over 35 years later, on review, it is still one of the scariest movies ever made. The twists are nuanced and plentiful, as well as psychologically and emotionally devastating.  Looking for monsters?  One need only look in the mirror.

Roman Polanski was - and still is, as far as I can tell - a master manipulator of perception.  Rosemary's Baby is one of his finest films, and its timeless theme - the struggle between good and evil - unfolds in a way that is as real today as it was when first released.

Oh, and I braved coming to New York 10 years after the film premiered.  Still here and loving the city!  I realized eventually, of course, that New York, as in so many films, was merely a great setting that provided a wonderful backdrop for this chilling tale to unfold.  A player in the molding of the film's atmosphere - but not the cause! It could have been set anywhere, and been just as effective.

I totally love this DVD! They really show how to do grooves, not just some moves that you can only do to a specific music video. These are grooves you can make  your own and go and dance any where with. That what I think makes this DVD series totally different from the rest. The moves are current and fun and the host and dancers are excellent dancers and also fun to watch. It goes slow enough and they turn around backwards to show you how to do it. LOVE IT!!! LOVE IT!!! LOVE IT!!! I am hooked on the Groovaloos

I thought that this was Adam Sandler's best movie he has made.That he played man who's a slacker that he trys to impress his girlfriend by adopting a cute 5-year-old boy(played by Dylan & Cole Sprouse).I think of how the movie should've ended real good is for Sonny to have Legal Custody of Jullian.I laugh out loud when I see this movie!!!

There's not much to say about the reputation of these movies.  There's also little to say about these DVDs, many of which are the high quality special edition collections.

Just do the math.  This is no brainer for people who don't own any of these DVDs.  Even if you only want 8 of them (less than half!), that's about $20.00 a movie (at Amazon's present sales price) and since many of these movies are special editions, that's still a steal!

This is a solid place to start your DVD collection.  Not everyone will enjoy all these movies (after all, they range from westerns to romantic pieces to musicals), but at this price even giving half of them away still allows you a tremendous savings.

One note:  the version of Amadeus here is the reissue and the longer, director's cut of the movie that was not originally released.  Some (including myself) prefer the tighter original release (which can still be gotten at Amazon but sadly has no commentary and requires you to flip the disc in the middle of the movie!)

Before I rate the box set and the four movies I would like to give you a brief history of my life with these films. When I was really young I use to always ask my dad to rent Tremors and we would all set and whatch it. But when I got a bit older and I could understand things better I became afraid and was scared of Grabiods coming up from underneath are house and eating me. Anyways after about two years I got the guts to whatch Tremors 2: After shocks. And Afterwards I was agian afraid of Grabiods and now Shriekers attacking me. Finally after about ten years of not watching them, me and my buddy Travis got to talking about Tremors and he asked me what Grabiods where. So I dicided to draw him pictures of them and after a few days I ended up creating a Tremors comic. So after becoming so involved with Tremors again I decided to watch the first film again. And after it ended, I bought it off Amazon and a week later I bought the third movie and then another week after that I bought the second. I had literly gone a 180 from fearing Tremors so long ago to become a huge fan. And when the fourth finally came out I had my family, my friend Travis and his brother hooked. Now after being a huge fan and watching the four films over and over I can finally rate them. The original Tremors is by far the best; with it's all star cast and great story line. The second best would have to be Tremors 4: The Legend Begins because it stays more true to the first and it shows how it all began. Tremors 2: After shocks would be third best since it stared Earl and Gummer and Tremors 3: Back to Prefection would have to be the worst since it's story is weak, its short and it takes the evolution thing a bit far. Overall this is a great pack of all four Tremors movies and if I hadn't boughten all of them aready I would buy this Attack Pack. Ps. Tremors 5 script has been finished and if Tremors 4 sales enough they will make a fifth. And one more thing it would be awsome if Universal would release Tremors: The Series on DVD.

this movie is definitely one of the better thrillers to come out since it's release.it's action packed and full of tension in it's 90-minutes of right-on time.kurt russell, always good, does a great job and this is no exception.the late great j.t. walsh,in one of his last performances,plays one of the best bad guys. i can't recommend this film enough for those seeking thrills, action and suspense.i can't really say what is wrong with the film but i just felt that it didn't belong in the perfect category,although maybe it should because it does answer on every call.a movie to watch again and again

I will be utterly honest, I don't buy music CDs anymore.  With so many bands hitting the streets faster than I can imagine, I honestly cannot keep up with them all.  Music begins to sound the same, corporations seem to have their pre-determined hit prior to the public even forming their own opinion.  Those like the Simpsons, Backstreet Boys, and even hip-hop artists are blending together to sound uniform, unoriginal, and overly drab.  I had nearly lost my faith in music, retreating to some of my older music like DMB, Counting Crows, and Travis, but then I found ... The Suns.

Stumbling around the Internet I discovered, shockingly, one of the videos to their album called "Romantic Death".  It was one of the most creative and disturbing videos that I have seen in quite some time.  Then it hit me, I couldn't get this song out of my mind.  Throughout the whole day I had the beat, the lyrics, and the overall sensation of the song stuck in my mind ... and I had only heard it once.  Like a drug, I needed more.  When I returned home that evening I found the song again and couldn't stop listening to it.  For the first time in a long time, I had found a new band.

Then, I bought this album.  Knowing nothing about the band except for the "Romantic Death" song, I put this in my DVD player and continued to be impressed.  Their videos are just as smart as their music.  Their tracks seem to cover every genre of music from folk, rock, and even hard edge.  Their lyrics seem well-considered, smart and a voice to a new generation.  My favorites of the album are:  

"Must Be You"
"Romantic Death" (Parental Guidance is suggested) 
"Lost at Home"
"Rockstop"
"We Tried"

In fact, every time I listen to this album I find a new song to explore, a new song to jam to on the way to work; a new song to enjoy!  For those skeptical of this band, I suggest this album to test your tastes.  Not only does it provide songs for you to burn onto other CDs which allow friends and family to explore this band, but also all of their energetic, original videos that will never see the light of day on MTV, but can be watched from the leisure of your DVD player.  The Sun are a breath of fresh air to the music industry and this album finally got me out of the corporate rut that seems to be plaguing this industry.

"...if the rockstops, it'll be all my fault..."

Grade: ***** out of *****

When DVDs came out I thought that CDs were gone.  I thought all bands would start making videos out of all their songs and selling DVDs instead of CDs.  That's what happened with records.  CDs came out and no one released vinyl anymore.  I am so glad that The Sun was the first band to do this.  Every song on this disk is golden.  There ain't a bad song in the bunch.  I heard about this disk on NPR radio.  It seems that it was taking Warner Bros. so long to release the CD that the band made homemade videos for all their songs.  The record company heard about this, watched the videos and said, that's cool, here is some more money, go and make the videos professionally and we will release it as a DVD, like it was a new idea or something.  I talked with my buddies and most of them also thought this should have been done a long time ago.  Another thing that is way cool is the audio tracks.  All the songs are on the disk in .wav form too so that you can put it in your computer and tell Windows Media Player or whatever you use to put it on a regular CD and play it in your car or convert them into MP3s.  There is even a sticker on the shrink wrap encouraging you to convert the .wav files.
I could go on and on about how much I love this disk.  I played it for my wife, kids, coworkers and they all loved it.  Like other reviewers said, The Sun is a new classic.  Keep it up boys.

(4.5/5 stars)  Exceptional envisioning of the Batman comic book by Tim Burton. Michael Keaton brings an understated disaffection in the role of the billionaire with a disturbed soul and dual personality. Contrast this with the unbridled mania of the character in "Batman Begins;" both are equally effective, though one style over the other will likely appeal to you. Is there any topping Jack Nicholson in his role as Jack Napier / The Joker? Only he can pull off such an exaggerated performance and have it be so fun without ruining a movie. Even though his role is suitably funny, there is a little too much humor overall in the movie. Robert Wuhl's character is especially unnecessarily comical. Also, while Danny Elfman's score is duly heroic and compelling, the music by Prince just doesn't mesh well and is probably not the best choice. Nonetheless, the visuals are stunning, the action is taut and the film vastly entertaining. It is a testament to the film's influence that numerous comic book movies have subsequently used Danny Elman scores (including rival Marvel's "Spider-Man") and molded black rubber suits, though this film also owes much to 1978's "Superman" with its realistic approach and A-list villains. Great stuff.

Until Sam Raimi made Spider-Man, I think we all regarded Tim Burton's Batman as the best superhero movie (even though I actually don't consider Batman to be a "superhero" because he has no superpowers). Burton directed this movie, and did a great job - this movie looks like it takes place in the 1920s, except that society is a lot more technologically advanced than it really was back then. 

Michael Keaton is Batman/Bruce Wayne. Needless to say, Batman is Wayne's alter ego. Keaton is magnificent at playing the character's alter ego. Keaton also does a good job playing the character when he's not in costume. Keaton's Bruce Wayne isn't as gloomy as Christian Bale's was in Batman Begins, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. But I would say Bruce Wayne was a little too cheerful for my liking in the Schumacher movies. But overall, Bale's Bruce Wayne is superior to Keaton's because Bale has a much more developed character to play. HOWEVER, Keaton plays a better costumed Batman than Bale.

The problem with this movie is that the Joker (Jack Nicholson) steals the show - the whole movie revolves around him, so this isn't Batman's movie. This movie should have been called "The Joker." So if you ever wondered why Nicholson got a higher billing than Keaton, now you know. The thing is, the writers never bothered to give Bruce Wayne a personality, and they barely scratch the surface of the character's background - we know practically nothing about Wayne. You'd think the guy that's Batman wouldn't be so uninteresting, but we're bored to tears everytime Wayne's onscreen (and out of costume). But when Keaton is onscreen in the Batman costume, Batman seems so menacing and captivating that you enjoy all of his scenes. He plays an even more menacing Batman than Bale - so I say that Keaton does a better Batman than Bale, but that Bale does a better Bruce Wayne than Keaton. But Keaton didn't have anything to work with, so it's not his fault his Bruce Wayne is so weak. But one of the strengths of Keaton's performance is that if you ever met Wayne, he'd seem like the last guy in the World that could be Batman. That's something Kilmer and Clooney failed to accomplish, but thankfully Bale was able to do it.

Michael Gough is a delight as the old butler Alfred. It's hard to believe Gough was a villain in so many horror movies over the years. I assumed Michael Caine's Alfred wouldn't compare to Gough's, but I was wrong - they're both great. Pat Hingle was really good (as Commissioner Gordon) in this movie. Hingle and Gough were in all four movies of the original series, and I enjoyed them both in Batman Returns. But in Batman Forever I didn't like them nearly as much, and in Batman & Robin I found their characters annoying as hell.

Vicki Vale's (Kim Basinger) investigation into Bruce Wayne's background is completely uninteresting. But I already knew what she would find out, so maybe that's why I didn't like those scenes. I also found the Vicki character annoying, screaming in terror every three seconds she was onscreen. 

There's lots of little things I love in this movie. The sight of Batman rising off the ground after the two muggers shoot him, (and the terrified expression of the gunmen) with Elfman's dramatic music blaring. The look on Napier's face when he sees the emptied safe. When the guy got fried by the Joker's joy-buzzer (one of the worst deaths I've ever seen in a movie). When the mimes close in on the press conference and unleash a surprise, and the Joker's speech right before a mob boss dies. The first Action News report of the movie. The way "URGENT" is written in messy crayon on the parcel. When Batman jumps through the skylight (accompanied by Elfman's music). The design of the Batmobile - minor changes make the car even cooler in Batman Returns. When the Batmobile speeds toward the Batcave (again, Elfman's music is awesome). The grin on the young Jack Napier. The Batmobile attacking the chemical factory. The Joker's facial expressions when he speaks in the microphone right after throwing lots of money to the crowd. When the bat signal is lit - but it's not as awesome as the first time it's lit in Batman Returns, or when it's lit at the end of Mask of the Phantasm.

And now a few complaints. This movie featured too many songs by Prince. After a while, they get unbearably annoying. There were lots of other great `80s pop songs that could have (and should have) been used in this movie. Another thing is the Joker seems completely helpless without his goons to back him up. So I found the final showdown at the bell tower a little boring. By the way, you can tell that Nicholson's make-up job would look a lot more realistic in this day and age of filmmaking. Burton's Batwing is cooler than Schumacher's Batwing (but not as cool as the one in Mask of the Phantasm). Anyway, the targeting system of Burton's Batwing seems a little screwed up - Batman has a big red target locked on the Joker, but the plane's missiles and machine guns miss their target. And the Joker didn't even try to get out of the way! Looks like Batman paid the price of designing his own weapon systems.

I always overlooked this movie's flaws (until I saw Batman Begins) for two reasons. First of all, I found Keaton's Batman to be so cool and the Joker to be so entertaining that I ABSOLUTELY LOVED this movie. Second of all, the poor quality of the sequels make this movie seem a lot better than it really is. Pretty much everytime the Joker or the Batman aren't onscreen, the movie is boring. But I must say that Batman was even cooler in Batman Returns than he was in this movie - and nastier.

I liked this movie when i first saw it and i seen it about 10 times... i like to watch any movie that involves gangs (especially bloods & crips) so i can learn from them...

If you're looking or are just a collector like me of gang movies... you may not want this one in your collection... becuase to me, it doesn't show enough Bloods & Crips in it.... the characters are fictional....there are some minor gangs in it as well called The White Fences (Latino/Hispanic gang - i've never heard of this gang, so i don't know if they are true or not.).

The actors who play the gang members of the White Fences are good actors though... i think they are better then Don Cheadle and Wayans who play Crip members... this movie centers more on White Fence and their rivalry w/ Crips... there's not too much focus on Bloods in here... it also more focuses on Sean Penn's character and Robert Duvall too (good cop/bad cop), and Penn on how he falls in love w/ a former gangmember woman in the White Fence gang.

Colors is a good watch...i just wish it had more gang focus in it...and more gang sets (chapters, i.e. Eight Tray Gangsters, Hoover, etc...) If you're looking for a good gang buy, buy the book "Monster" by Sanyika Shakur a.k.a. Monster Kody Scott, or "Do Or Die" by Leon Bing. Those 2 books far surpasses this movie..

This DVD showcases a somewhat new (as of the 2001 recording) sound for Sade, with slightly poppier and quicker supporting music. However, Sade's voice adapts beautifully, and she is one of those singers who just doesn't need the standard studio treatment to sound tremendous. Her buttery, chocolate lyrics come through with mesmerizing clarity on this DVD.

After a few years of owning this DVD, I still enjoy and am transfixed by the wonderful editing, sound, and lights on this DVD. I highly recommend it to add to your "chill-out" collection. No longer the jazzy Sade of yesteryear, the versatility of songs on this long (almost 2-hours?) dvd will keep you grooving for hours

I guess the reason I enjoyed the movie so much was because I went into the theatre expecting a good drama. And that's exactly what I got. The story was very interesting to me. I enjoyed the relationships between the villagers, especially Lucious and Ivy.

The scary moments just added to the drama. Having grown up in the country, I know how scary the woods can be. I loved all the twists to the story.

The only thing I didn't like was William Hurt's performance. It was too hammy. I think if this critical role had been cast by another actor, the movie would've moved along at a better pace.

But still a great movie

The funny thing about this movie is that I read negative reviews here, and rather agree with what they assert: that the plots and some of the characters are not very "evolved" due to time. If you disect the movie, yes this is *true.*

NONETHELESS, I love this movie! I love watching the what the actors DO with this material, and how they manage, with so little time, to invest the viewer in their story. Emma Thompson gives a perfect performance, I think, highlighting how complicated long marriages can become, and the pitfalls of being "too functional." Bill Nighy is hilarious, acting as the needed jolts in between serious moments...quite refreshing.   

Most of all, it is genuinely funny.  Life can feel (or at least my life can feel) disjointed, and I love a movie where a larger pattern emerges from seemingly chaotic events and connections.

WOW!  I had forgotten how powerful a story was told with a wonderful, haunting score to match.  I'm glad our pleas have been heard!  With new High Definition equipment coming down in price, I can't think of a better movie to view for all with discriminating tastes and those will discover the finer aspects of the cinema.

Update:  Is this the Region 2 & 4 version that was released overseas?  If so we are in for a real treat!

THE STORY OF NASA'S SUCESSFULL FAILURE! ! !

This movie is base on Jim Lovell's book LOST MOON, the title coming from the fact that EVERY other astronuat that went to the moon the first time would walk on it the second. Lovell is the ONLY man to circe it both times he went there! 

What makes this film so realistic is that Dave Scott (7th man out of 12 to walk on the moon)was technicial advisor on the film. I've known the story of the flight very well for years before the film was released, and watching the film I'd say to myself that this is about the time that XXX happened and sure enough a few minutes later it sure did!

Look quick at the very end of the movie for the REAL Jim Lovell, he's the Navy Captian with gray hair shaking T. Hanks hand!

see the IMAX version last. Several scenes have been edited out

Here we have an example of a key artwork about America's psychological and political framework during emergence from the economic depression of the 1930s, crying out for careful restration to the condition it so  deserves

We all know the movie and story of The Silence Of The Lambs. I reviewed the movie and gave it a 5 star rating because to me, it is one of the best films ever made. Now, with Red Dragon, I give it 4 stars but I think this is a very good movie and what makes it so good is.... Anthony Hopkins, the brilliant actor who plays Hannibal Lecter. I don't think this movie would have been as good if Hopkins wouldn't have played the role of Lecter. I own the original Manhunter, which is an older movie and it was good but Hopkins can not be beat for the Hannibal Lecter role. This is a great thriller film!! Edward Norton delivers a very good performance as retired FBI agent Will Graham. When a series of serial killing style murders start, Graham is called out of retirement to help the FBI catch the killer known as "The Tooth Fairy". He eventually seeks the aid of Lecter to help him find who this killer is. Like Silence Of The Lambs, we find Graham visiting Lecter in his maximum security facility. Very cool scenes in this movie with some blood and violence. This movie holds true to the book with the same name. We get to see Lecter wearing the famous face mask he wore in S.O.T.L. Without going further into all the details of the movie, I'll just say this is a great prequel although it came after S.O.T.L. and the movie Hannibal. Also, Ralph Fiennes delivers a good performance as the Red Dragon. For anyone who hasn't seen this movie, it's a must see!!!!

this comedy, like Click has a funny side to it and then switches to a darker side half way through. the characters in this film can be hated at points, especially Michael Douglas' and Matt Dillon's but there is a lighter side! Owen Wilson is very likeable as Dupree, an unemployed party guy who is in need of love and a good paying job. the cast is fine and one of the strength's in this film! however, I think it gets too serious at points. this is supposed to be a comedy after all. I wouldn't buy it but it is certainly worth renting

The Brood is the lightning in the bottle that director David Cronenberg has never been able to duplicate. While all of his films definitely have his fingerprints all over them, The Brood managed to rise to the top of all of his films. It is absolutely dripping in a sense of dispair and dread. There is a pervading coldness about it - such that you want to wrap up in something warm as you watch it - you want to watch it with the lights on because you're very much afraid of what might be there if you turn off the lights.

The film is a psychological thriller wrapped in a slasher flick. It warrants slasher status simply because of the sheer number of onscreen murders that take place. This is a very bloody film!

Samantha Eggar is nuts and in a weird clinic for people like her. She is being treated by a creepy Oliver Reed (in one of his better performances). Art Hindle is her ex husband and he's worried about how she is treating their young daughter. After a while that is the least of his worries, as these horribly disfigured and (what the Hell are they?) bizarre little children run around killing all the people that have really ticked off Samantha Eggar.

I won't say more, because part of the horror in a Cronenberg film is the pseudo-science that he get you to believe in.

Whereas Cronenberg's Videodrome was weird, but not terribly good, The Brood is one of the creepiest films I've ever seen and a guilty pleasure (can I really call it that?) that I choose to subject myself to every so often.

Really! What ARE those things?

They are not just making their way through a boring life, they're out there doing interesting things, doing cool stuff, having adventures & generally living their lives to the fullest. The "they" that I refer to includes just about everybody in the movie, from Paul Pena to the guys travelling with him to Richard Feynman to the Tuvans that Paul meets and befriends.

The documentary gets hazy in spots (I'm still not sure of some of the Tuvan inter-relationships) but does a good job of establishing empathy with Pena, a blind man relying on others in a place far from home. The DVD extras are o.k., the interview with the filmmakers gave some backstory to the movie. I did not watch the film with the filmmakers commentary turned on; a commentary seems kind of contrary to the purpose of a documentary but I suppose you could get more factual info & technical details on the commentary

 The military courtroom drama,"A Few Good Men" is one of those films, that through endless cable showings seems to have taken a life of it's own. But even with countless viewings it retains it's emotional power and speaks to us about issues, that have become more important than ever. In the film we meet Lt. Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise) a young successful, military lawyer, who is considered so slick at plea bargaining out cases, that supposably he's "never even seen the inside of a courtroom". He is assigned the cases of PFC Louden Downey (James Marshall) and Lance Cpl. Harold Dawson (Wolgang Bodison). They are accused of murder and a host of other charges, when at the Guantanamo Bay military base they performed a "Code Red" (an illegal form of discipline within a military unit) on Pvt. William Sandiago, which unintentionally resulted in his death. While the two accused Marines admit they did the "Code Red", both claim they were under orders to do so by their superiors, which includes Base Commander, Col. Nathan Jessup (a brillaint Jack Nicholson) a powerful, highly decorated officer, who is being groomed for one of the top slots in the military command. With both time running out and a lack of legal evidence, Kaffee must get to the bottom of a conspiracy and present his case, even if it means putting his own career in jeopardy. Through a brilliant script (based on the play by Aaron Sorkin), Rob Reiner's steady direction and the cast's dynamic performances this film looks at the meaning of highly held military principles such as "code, honor & discipline". Should a soldier always follow orders no matter what? Whats' more important our ethics & principles (on which this country was founded) or our need for security? Is Col. Jessup right? Can we not "handle the truth"? It's hard to believe, that this film was made way back in 1992. In this post 9/11, post Abu Grebbe world, where our country is on a war footing the questions, that the film seeks to address have become more profound and important than ever. The film is filled with great performances. While I am not normally a huge Tom Cruise fan, I have to admit, that Cruise does a wonderful job as the young conflicted lawyer. The same goes for the great supporting cast which includes good acting turns from Demi Moore, Kevin Bacon and Kiefer Sutherland. But what really propels and turns this film into a classic is the brilliant, dynamic performance, that comes from Jack  Nicholson. When Cruise puts Nicholson on the courtroom stand and starts pointly egging him on, you just watch in awe as Nicholson just continually builds the character's palpable anger, until he just boils over and explodes in the now infamous "You Can't Handle the Truth" speech. Even though the speech and Nicholson's performance has been endlessly quoated & parodied, when you put it in the context of this movie it still has so much power and resonance. If you are interested in seeing a well made, movie courtroom drama, that is both thought provoking and entertaining then I highly recommend "A Few Good Men"

I have been waiting for this DVD to come out for a very long time!  It is a hilarious movie based on a true story about the creation of the Bradley war tank.  It shows how the promotion system in the military used to push for new war products to be used, even if they were not acceptable for use, and the struggle of one man to do the right thing.  You will not stop laughing while watching this movie!

This is another superbly done documentary from the award winning PBS investigative journalism series Frontline (Peabody Award, Emmy and many more!). Disregard what one reviewer said about this being pro-Walmart propaganda paid for by the corporation. He's obviously  smoking something, because this is made and hosted by Hedrick Smith, a PULITZER prize winning journalist who used to write for the NY Times. He is one of America's most respected journalists. I started watching the show since I was in high school (I'm now late 20's) and their shows are exceptionally high quality. Now, if Frontline is interviewing people who lost jobs and showing Rubbermaid factory equipment being auctioned off because they got put out of business by Walmart, how is this pro-Walmart? 

The story starts in America and its impact on the US economy. He interviews some professors, economists, managers, suppliers, and executives. Then the story moves to China and HK, and then back to the US. There are some very clear insights from nmost of the people interviewed especially from one professor who talks about the shift in American culture and business history. 

Is Walmart good for America? I can't answer that and neither can Frontline. This documentary does an excellent job presenting facts without judgement and presents both sides and the complex shades in the middle. It asks some thought provoking questions. The US trade deficit is getting worse every day. Quality is going up (some "Made in China" stuff is now very good and getting exponentially better every year), and that's really scary for us in America. Who's the blame? Well, all of us. We're not competing well in the global economy, and we want the cheapest goods. We're not willing to put our money where our mouth is. 

If you're interested in economics, history, social issues, this is a must see. If you care about the American economy, and global events, you should watch this documentary. It's loads better than the "Walmart, the High Cost of Low Prices" film (which is very one sided and not nearly as well done). oh,.. and start learning Chinese

John Waters is a very brilliant and odd film director. he brings camp, trash, filth, humor and morality to all of his movies, pushes peoples buttons, goes farther than most dare (and then some) isnt afraid of being censored and does what he does and to me thats brillance. true alot of people will think his work is tasteless stupid and gross but thats the whole point! lol! people who dont have a sense of humor or who are not open minded will not like his movies. these are not for right wing conservatives but they should see them (especially a Dirty shame) to broaden their minds a little more. my personal favorites are Pink Flamingos, A dirty Shame, Female Trouble, Polyester and Desperate Living. Serial mom is also a fav but not in this collection. He has come from underground trash to Queen of filth,trash and crudeness and for not being afraid of being bold, outlandish, outspoken and bizzar, I applaud you John Waters. Brillant

Despite the chintzy, unconvincing facial hair (Jeff Daniels' being the exception); Martin Sheen's too-gentlemanly interpretation of Gen. Lee's accent (and his beard); obvious & saccharine soliloquies about the higher purpose for fighting the war; generalized (and largely inaccurate) interpretations of the underlying history of the war; and hopelessly, ridiculously, wildly off-the-mark attempts atNew England accents, the film still works.

I understand that to get a film produced and distributed, it is often necessary to have recognizable names in the cast.  But an unknown who looks more like General Lee than Martin Sheen would have been a better choice.  And C. Thomas Howell's performance--well, let's just say that his glued-on beard was more convincing than his acting.  Jeff Daniels, however, does an excellent job, in large part because he doesn't try to convince you he's from New England and consequently does not come off like Cliff from Cheers, using every stereotype associated with nasal 'r'-dropping.  Instead of focusing on the so-called nasality of  the NE accent (think of Sheen in The Missiles of Octobah), Daniels allows the viewer to suspend disbelief.  But then, here comes CT Howell again to slap you across the face and remind you that Sheen and Kevin Costner aren't the only actors who should have appeared as New Englanders in an Ed Wood production.

I think the story works because there's enough commitment to historical military fact to make it believable.  The battle scenes probably should have been more visually graphic to evoke the horror of the battle, but the movie makers either didn't have the budget for gore (maybe it was spent on the obviously fake beards) or decided to err on the side of forbearance.  If Gettysburg had been made 8-10 years later, it might have benefited from the newer style of violence-depiction, as in Saving Private Ryan, Thin Red Line, or Gladiator.  It falls a bit short of that, however.

Finally, it should be noted that the producers/director seem to be operating on a rather simplistic view of the war's historical underpinnings, opting to represent the northern point of view as one united behind the idea of freeing the slaves. Anyone who knows about the Boston busing riots of the 1970s will understand that not all of the north is steeped in racial generosity and brotherhood. Very few who fought on the side of the blue fought because they believed in the abolition of slavery.  They fought to preserve the Union, which is a very different concept.  Abolition of slavery happened to be the issue that forced the South's hand, but it was not the sole cause of the war.  The movie dumbs this down a bit, making the message more like what you'd find in a 5th-grade text book.

The battle at Gettysburg was certainly pivotal, but viewers should remember that it did not end the Civil War.  The north absolutely needed to win it, but Lee continued to cause the North fits for almost 2 years after Gettysburg.  C. Thomas Howell will continue to cause me fits every time I think of this movie.

Still and all, the film is very watchable.  And due credit should be given to the re-enactors, arguably the greatest source of credibility for the film

The perpetrators of a high-level corporate scandal (Masayuki Mori, Takashi Shimura, Ko Nishimura) are pursued by the illegitamate son (Toshiro Mifune) of a low-level functionary that they drove to suicide to protect their schemes.  This film begins as a deeply satisfying revenge epic, but the masterful director Akira Kurosawa is not content to let it rest there.  He draws out all the moral complexities of the situation, then hits us with an unexpected development at the end that gives an ironic twist to his title.  The bad may not always go to prison for their crimes, but do they really "sleep well?

SPOILER ALERT


The ending of this 118-minute marvel seems an almost foregone conclusion. The bored billionaire did it. However, he and the sexy insurance detective play with each other until the audience is very, very hot. Pierce Brosnan, the billionaire, still sexist from his stint as James Bond, enjoys playing with the lady, Renee Russo. And she, as the tough but sexy Catherine Olds Banning, loses her heart to him, as much heart as such a sexpot character is allowed. In the process, she shows some very appealing nipples. 

The 1968 version, of which this is a remake, starred Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway. In this version, to the socially irresponsible, self-absorbed 90s are ever present. We don't mind not having the suspense, we just yearn to see Brosnan and Russo "get it on." Dunaway appears as a psychiatrist who is trying to help the billionaire figure out why he is so socially irresponsible.

Brosnan, as Thomas Crown, is bored, but open to being titillated by a beautiful woman, for as long as he is interested in her. For thrills, he steals priceless works of art from publicly-funded museums. The film makes it clear he can do so, under the noses of   security guards, police, and hundreds of innocent art-lovers. Russo's insurance company insured the painting, so she is looking to recover the irreplaceable, but impossible to fence Monet, and save her employer a bundle. 

What we have here is a film with clever dialog, rich and exotic sets, and loads of sexual tension. One wonders now, after Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, and other corporate heists, just whom Brosnan is cheating in order to support his high-tech heist brigade. How many of his employees are going to lose their pensions or health care benefits over this. He never really, you know, works. But I digress.

Dennis Leary has a character role as the streetwise New York detective, who advises Russo's Banning. As we watch her slowly spiral out of control, risking her job and her reputation, we are kept mildly engaged in the question of whether Russo will fall for him, or Brosnan. Duh.

The film moves back and forth from caper to cover-up. This can be confusing, but who cares? All we have to do is wait for their next move, the next gorgeous set, the next revealing love scene.

The Thomas Crown Affair will keep both men and women interested, for all the usual reasons.

It is a film worth watching, and a great date flick

I am a dancer. I found the choreography in this movie beautiful, brillient and different. The emotion in it really touched me, and I had actually fallen out of dancing because of many different reasons and this movie really did bring me back to my love of dance. It's very rare to find dance movie that will offer quite as much as this movie did. Not to mention I absolutly adore George De La Pena. Awsome dancer and he was my favorite character in the movie. I love the fact that every character has something they are working through, no one is exactly perfect. To me, although the acting may not be what every one would call oscar quality, to me, it shows a glimps in to life. How pent up emotions can lead to frustrations that are some times difficult to get through. This movie, to me is well worth the watch. Sorry for the ramble.

I was sooooooooo excited to see that this movie had been released, and I was not disappointed.  The dancing was magnificent, and it was amazing to see Patrick & Lisa together.
I have to saythought for many....it was disheartening to see you perform with your wife, Patrick, because so many of us have fantasized of that same possibility!
I would recommend it to ALL who love dance!  It is a beautiful tribute to what a person CAN do!

This is an essential collection for every Al Pacino fan. In Carlitos Way and Scarface he does one of his best work ever. Then there is the performance that gave him his only Oscar so far in A Scent of a Woman. If  you enjoy really good films with a good script and cast you should buy the  Al Pacino collection

Warner Herzog's "Grizzly Man" won the Director's Guild Award for best feature documentary, but the people who pass out Oscars apparently didn't agree. "Grizzly Man" was not among this year's nominees for Best Documentary.

Many of Herzog's narrative films, such as "Fitzcaraldo," deal with man's attempt to challenge the indifference of nature, so "Grizzly Man" is not a departure by any means. Herzog's heroes are often obsessed with accomplishing some mysterious, even bizarre, goal. Timothy Treadwell's fixation is on grizzly bears. "I am one of them," he is heard to say. He survived in the wild, accompanied by a video camera, and, on at least one occasion, by a girlfriend., living among the most dangerous beasts in the world whom he apparently believed he was protecting. "Animals rule," he said, fist defiantly pumping in the air. "Timothy conquered." 

Treadwell became a minor celebrity during his life, appearing once on David Letterman's CBS show, but he aspired to more. Before letting his love of animals consume him, he tried his luck in Hollywood. He got an agent, and auditioned for TV and movie roles. He was, he told his parents, second choice for the bartender role on "Cheers" which went to Woody Harrelson. Missing out on that opportunity left him "crushed." 

What really drove Treadwell? 

He reminds me of fey little Carson on "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy," and as he openly mentions that it's easier to be gay than straight, I wonder if he was homosexual but unable to deal with his orientation, transferred his love of men to the roughest trade imaginable: grizzly bears. "I like girls," he volunteers, but then he mentions various cruising places - truck stops, men's rooms - in such a way as to make me think he had personal experience haunting these kinds of homosexual hangouts. 

He was also an alcoholic. Were his wilderness adventures an escape from passions he was emotionally and psychologically unprepared to pursue? 

Those who are seen offering their remembrances of Treadwell never allude to his sexuality. They describe a man whose life is ruled by a naive, hippy, New Age approach to nature and who died as a result. The bears, to whom he gave names like "Mr. Chocolate" and "Tabitha," need protection, he said, and he was their self-appointed caretaker. Others suggest that, despite his good intentions, he did more harm to the animals than he could have imagined. After Treadwell was eaten by a bear, the animal was shot and its remains became a feast for other forms of wildlife. Shooting a bear because he eats a man is comparable to shooting the customers at KFC for eating chicken. What is a bear supposed to do with a human who invades his turf? Treadwell was an intruder. One mans saysTreadwell made the mistake of thinking these were people in bear suits. But Treadwll knew these were animals. Trouble is, his knowledge of animals seemed to have been learned from Disney cartoons. 

The universe, director Herzog says, is ruled by hostility, chaos, and murder. Treadwell had a different philosophy. "Isn't that sad?" he squeals in his high-pitched girlish voice as he observes a bee who apparently expired while doing "his pollen thing." 

"I love that bee," he says. 

Partially financed by the Discovery Channel, "Grizzly Man" is superficially a nature documentary about a man who loved wildlife so much that he felt at home among the bears and wolves more than he did his fellow humans. But it's also a portrait of a highly disturbed man who admits he was treated for manic depression but rejected medication to control the condition because, he admitted, he needed those soaring highs and crushing lows. He also needed to record his solitary life on video. We see him crying as he pets a wolf, laughing when his command that God make it rain seems to have been obeyed, and arrogantly blasting the humans whom he perceives as the enemy of the animals. What we do not see is his final encounter with the bear that ate him. Mercifully, the lens cap was on the camera when he was attacked. The camera was running, though, and Treadwell's screams, and the screams of his girlfriend, were recorded. Out of respect for his family, Herzog does not let the audience hear these recordings. Instead, we see him listening to the audio, and his reaction (telling one of Treadwell's friends that she must never listen to it, just as she must never see the coroner's photos of the aftermath of the attack), is possibly more effective than including the obviously horrific sounds in the film. 

"I had no life," Treadwell said of his days before he began to frolic with ferocious beasts. "Now I have a life." That life is memorialized in Herzog's film.

I loved the first one and I think, with the logic and plot of the first one, this follows through. We knew they changed the world, and in this sequel we see that. The actors do a good, since the lead characters are suppose to be, let's say less intelligent, but nice. I think this movie and the 1st one are classics. I like the grim reaper, his atitude during the movie, and the fact the he is the comic relief (okay so most of the movie is comic relief) Even if they are fun to watch to laugh at, it is worth it to watch

This movie is high in my top 10 off all times list, and is probably the best 'mainstream hollywood' movie I can think of. I watched it for the 3rd or 4th time and it is just as enjoying, thrilling and suspenseful as it was when I saw it first more than 10 years ago. My 12 years old daughter watched it with me for the first time and enjoyed it just as well. Great performance by all cast but especially Hanks, Paxton and Beacon. Probably Ron Howard best film ever

It's strange; this just came on FX, and once it was on, I was compelled to stay up and watch the whole thing, even though I've already seen it (in the theatres during its initial release run), and it cost me sleep to watch it all the way through this time around. 

Even for all of the bad press that this movie got, and all of the disgruntled viewers who were expecting another horror, this truly is one of my favorites from M. Night Shyamalan - this, along with "Lady In The Water" (another MUST have for me), is a movie that I feel compelled to add to my collection. As the other reviewers state, it's not truly scary, but more a suspenseful film, as I actually find ALL of Shyamalan's movies to be. In my humble opinion, he's not trying to provide movies best-suited to Halloween scare-fest marathons, but movies that are suspenseful and thought-provoking. As annoying as some of his ticks may be to some viewers, there's thought put into each of his films, unlike stupid wastes of celluloid like "Hostel" and those damned "Saw" movies (enough, already)! 

At least after seeing this in the theatre, I felt that I'd gotten my money's worth for the ticket price, and this is definitely a movie that I feel I could watch repeatedly. In my opinion, the social commentary and romantic aspects only add to the viewing experience provided by this film. Don't buy this if you're looking for a horror like "The Exorcist" - if that's what you want, buy and watch "The Exorcist". If you're looking for a film with twists and turns that tie in to a somewhat deeper meaning, and will have you nodding your head in agreement with the way things play out on screen, buy this movie. Even if you know what happens in the end, I'm sure you'll find yourself wanting to watch it again over time

Intimacy isn't about titillation or tanned toned Hollywood studs and babes having perfectly choreographed sex in beautiful lighting while poor piano music plays. Instead it's about an ordinary pair of people seeking solace in a purely physical relationship. Both are empty individuals and briefly find something to fire them in their weekly sexual meetings. Nothing is said but there is a purity of understanding.

The relationship, and the film, only falters when the film moves outside the seedy flat that the liaisons take place in. The wordless arrangement can only work while everything is strictly anonymous, and once Jay (Rylance) delves into Claire's (Fox) personal life their apparently simple relationship becomes more complicated.

It's also here that the film briefly slumps. Jay encounters Claire's taxi driver husband, played by an uncharacteristically off form Timothy Spall. Speaking nonsense and totally over the top, his scenes are almost unbearably dreary. I can certainly see why Claire would want peace and quiet and intense sex after listening to that intensely boring man twitter on. Still, it doesn't make his scenes any better to watch.

Despite that though the film regains it footing and ends strongly. Even Timothy Spall's character shows some hidden depths! However, Intimacy works best as a comment on the relationships people trap themselves in. It's easier to stay in an unhappy relationship than walk out, and starting something new takes courage. Jay and Claire are unable to escape their empty lives, except in their sexual relationship. Really both are cowards. Neither is happy, but neither makes a serious effort to change their circumstances. Sex is a temporary answer to a permanent problem, and until they reach out for something more neither will be happy. 
The film had an increasing energy which I liked, and I'm sure you would like it too, if you let yourself inside the film.

If you liked "Raise the Red Lantern" or "The Last Emperor",this is a perfect movie.Gong Li,who played a concubine fighting with others for her husband's affection now plays a woman who realizes another man loves her husband.

"Farewell My Concubine" uses Chinese opera as a way of telling the story.I used to listen to a lot of Chinese opera--which is an acquired taste.This movie uses the story of a king&his beloved concubine's self-sacrifice to frame the love story between two men.When one of the men falls in love with and marries a woman,the stage is set for a tragic love triangle.The final scenes are chilling,powerful.This is a spectacle not to be missed

Let me preface this review by stating that if I had to do this 90-minute workout in its entirety I'd probably never reach for it -- it's just too long. But in its dvd format Karen Voight has thoughtfully provided a menu that has made this otherwise excellent program usable and doable. It's set up so that you can follow it in logical sections and, best of all, you can completely skip the squat sequence and just do the amazingly thorough floor workout, which is terrific for those like me who suffer from knee problems which prevent us from performing squats and lunges.

I am able to successfully break this whole program down into *warmup/arms/abs/cooldown-stretch* Mondays and Thursdays, and *warmup/floor legs/cooldown-stretch* on Tuesdays and Fridays, and each intense workout is about 45 minutes.

Music and clothing - especially the men's outfits! - are dated but I can get over it (though I'm sure there are others who cannot). Broken into shorter segments, I rate this 4.5 stars which I round up to 5.

Tim Burton offers the most charmingly off-beat yet visually sumptuous movies in Hollywood.  From his stop-animation work ("The Corpse Bride") to dark romances ("Edward Scissorhands") to horror ("Sleepy Hollow"), Burton never fails to offer feasts for the eyes that manage to make you squirm just a bit uncomfortably - all the right notes are there, but some are played just off-key enough to create the thrill of tension.

Perhaps no other director was so suited to film Roald Dahl's most famous work, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," and remain true to the author's vision.  Most people associate the tamer, goofy "Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory," starring Gene Wilder, with Dahl's tale, but forget that Dahl had a healthy streak of Lemony Snicket sensibility to him.  So it is perfect that Burton makes a darker, more dangerous film for all to enjoy.

The visuals in "Charlie" are astounding.  The chocolate waterfall and river look like actual liquid chocolate (not the icky brown water of "Willie Wonka"), and the squirrel-nut-sorting room is a classic of mind-blowing set design.  And that is not all - oh, no, that is not all!

Possibly the most visually stunning element in "Charlie" is Willie Wonka himself, played by Burton favorite Johnny Depp.  Depp sinks so deep into his roles that he becomes one with them, and one wonders what inspired Depp's quirky, nervous, mean-spirited, selfish concoction.  Depp plays Wonka as tight as he plays Jack Sparrow loose, and he never misses a note. But whereas Gene Wilder's Willie Wonka was more genial puppetmaster, Depp's Wonka has a sadistic streak in him, perhaps instilled by his dentist father.  This is a great, if much-maligned, performance.

The most infamous element from the first movie was the seemingly-drug-inspired presence of the Oompa-Loompas, Wonka's army of diminutive henchmen.  In the Wilder film, the Oompa-Loompas were dwarfs given to sophomoric dance numbers to the irritatingly catchy "oompa-loompa-do-be-de-do" tune.  In this version, all the Oompa-Loompas are played by the same character (even though there are hundreds of them), and their dance numbers are even more fantastic.  However, the songs don't have quite the same sharp punch as the original songs, which pointed out the various failings of the kids and their parents as they got eliminated from the contest. Indeed, there are several lyrics that I just couldn't catch in this film version, and that is a pretty major quibble.

Far from a feel-good movie, but definitely a good movie, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" deserves to be seen and, for fans of artistic visions, studied.

DVD #1 presents a terrific hour-long history of the franchise.  It hits both the high- and lowpoints, and indicates why the Packers are a national treasure and probably the greatest team in NFL history.  Lambeau, Hutson, Lombardi, Starr, Nitschke, the Ice Bowl, Favre, White, the nine NFL championships, the three Super Bowls they won (I, II, and XXXI), and the one they lost (XXXII).  The best fans in the league, the smallest venue, the most legendary stadium, and the team's miraculous survival over 80+ years, in no small part because they are the only pro team in any sport that is entirely owned by their fans.  The highpoint, of course, is the 15-minute section entitled "Lombardi" which encapsulates the Green Bay career of the NFL's greatest coach--but at the end of this DVD about the Packers' heroic ongoing history, you realize that as great as Lombardi was, the team is greater still.

DVD #2 was produced earlier in VHS format (I bought it at the Packer Pro Shop in GB) and portrays the greatest game in Packers history and one of the greatest in NFL history. Other reviewers have justly praised its play-by-play reconstruction and modern-day interviews with the participants.  Yes, Kramer was offside--but luck is a part of any game, and the Cowboys had a generous helping of it in the second quarter.  Like another reviewer, I love the postgame interviews, even the glimpses of Green Bay in 1967.  The muted colors of the frigid game (maybe Packer jerseys actually were that dark in the 60s--I see the same thing in footage of other games) and the elegaic tone of the final interviews give a haunting sense of a world that is now departed.

2 Fast 2 Furious is one of those sequels that comes around every so often that doesn't require you to have seen the original. I saw this movie for the first time not too long after it came out, and having never seen the original, I thought I would be lost and wouldn't enjoy myself as much as other people, but on the contrary - I left the experience much happier than when I came in.

This film is full of quick one-liners that deserve a laugh. The special effects and the car races will leave your mouth gaping open. I have heard and read that people didn't appreciate this film as much because it seemed to focus more on a plot than the first film did rather than focus more on the races, but overall, I think the balance works well. Even thinking of the plot that we are left with, I really can't see another time when a race would even be appropriate.

And as for people saying that this film is worse than the original, I would have to disagree...Why? Frankly, I have always been a firm believer than Vin Diesel is entirely overrated as an actor. (I mean, c'mon - Have you seen the Pacifier?) He's nothing more than a meat head who, while able to do pretty good fight scenes, should leave the dialogue to someone else. 

Yes, this film is for the younger crowd, and there are numerous occasions when unbelievable events take place (take the boat jumping as an example), but there is no saying that an older person wouldn't enjoy it as well...The only thing that I will say is that you really shouldn't go into this film expecting an Oscar worthy performance, or else you will be disappointed. If you sit back and take this as the fun romp that it is, however, you will thoroughly enjoy yourself

In Alan Alda's &quot;Betsy's Wedding&quot;,he is Eddie Hopper,a construction foreman and architect. His daughter Betsy(Molly Ringwald) and her boyfriend Jake Lovell(Dylan Walsh) announce their engagement at a family gathering. Betsy's sister Connie(Ally Sheedy) is happy herself but jealously upset because she can't find herself a man. The late Madeline Kahn is Lola,Eddie's wife. At the gathering Lola's sister Gloria Henner(Catherine O'Hara) tells her she plans to get even with her husband Oscar(Oscar winner Joe Pesci) for all his inept schemes. Gloria says &quot;Someday,when I have my nice little nestegg,I can take a walk and he can go f--- himself.&quot; Anthony LaPaglia is Stevie Dee,a guy who would later in the film become Connie's boyfriend. Stevie Dee's uncle Georgie(Burt Young) is a business associate of Oscar's. There's once scene where when Betsy and Jake meet with the man performing their wedding ceremony,the Dixie Cups' CHAPEL OF LOVE is played. They want to be pronounced &quot;husband and wife&quot; instead of &quot;man and wife&quot; and they have &quot;obey&quot; omitted from &quot;love,honor and obey&quot;. The late Julie Bovasso plays Rose,Eddie's mother and Joey Bishop is Eddie's deceased father. The father,as a ghost,is seen and heard only by Eddie. The wedding was somewhat disasterous. It took place in a rented tent on a rainy evening. The tent was made of cheap,not-too-strong materials so a hole in the roof where the rain fell into increased to the point where it caved in. After a heated argument between Gloria and Oscar at the reception also in the tent,Gloria pulls a loose thread causing the growing hole and the dowse of fallen rain. So Connie and Stevie Dee can be together more often,Stevie Dee applies to the police academy,since Connie's a cop. Unbelievably,the wedding dinner was pizza! By the way,Oscar planned to divorce Gloria and become romantically involved with his secretary,who also attended Betsy's and Jake's wedding. That was one of the things that led to the argument. The wedding ceremony was performed in the Jewish style. Jake stepped on a wine glass wrapped in a cloth napkin. This film was Alan Alda's most successful and not a minor hit like &quot;A New Life&quot;,another one of his personally scripted films

Excellent little known movie with Viggo Mortensen as an F.B.I.
agent under deep cover to infiltrate Japenese Mob. Great
performances by all {Michael Nouri, a little over the top}
great action and sentimentality when Viggos character is torn
between man who treats him like a son and duty as an agent after
F.B.I makes deal with mobster Nouri to make a hit on the Yakuza

There aren't enough movies like this these days. Family oriented(centered actually), adventure with edutainmental attributes.

Great cast, great score, great(albeit goofy) story.

People give this film too much credit for being implausible, which is exactly what makes it so much fun to imagine the ramifications if it were true. If you're looking for adventure and fun, thrilling characters in a family film, this is it

At first I was skeptical about buying an aging McCartney band tour dvd, even though I have every one, so I bought it. I watched it from start to finish. UNBELIEVABLY SUPERB. The lighting, the energy of the band and the crowd, suprising interviews!! and ole Paul looked pretty good for having passed the 64 year mark! After watching it I felt like I had been there. It is the best one I have seen yet! If you like McCartney, this is him at his best not to mention some great songs you will be surprised to hear!
Excellent buy

Eraserhead is filled with strange, uncanny scenes.  What is it to be uncanny? Dictionary.com defines it as having or seeming to have a supernatural or inexplicable basis; beyond the ordinary or normal; mysterious; arousing superstitious fear or dread; uncomfortably strange.  I would want to define it for this film as the quality of being familiar and strange at the same time. One has the sense of having never seen such weirdness and having vaguely remembered seeing it somewhere.  

The movie does not have a linear, logical storyline.  It is a mood piece, for want of a better term.  A visual poem, which depends on what the viewer brings to the interpretation as much as what appears on the screen.  If you let your mind play among these images, it will begin to invent meaning for itself.  You may be surprised and enlightened at what meanings you find in it.

The cinematography is stunning, not beautiful in any traditional meaning of that term, but arresting: you simply cannot turn your head away.

Will you like it?  Well, I think this is one of those movies you either love or hate.  Think of it as a Rorshach -- how interesting you find it may just depend on how interesting you are

The fifteen-year-old Duncan (Emile Hirsch) and his laconic father Edgar Mudge (Richard Jenkins) are reeling after the death of the most important person in their life. Duncan's mother and Edgar's wife died suddenly, whilst biking some farm eggs to her neighbor.  An alcoholic, she was the glue that tethered this family together, and her death has left Duncan and Edgar emotionally fragile and at a loss.  

It isn't only his wife's passing that is bothering Edgar; he notices that Duncan's a "different" kind of boy - sensitive, kindly and delicate. Duncan constantly dotes on his pet chicken and dresses in his mother's clothes, perhaps in an effort to stay connected to him mom.  At church - where he sings out of tune  - a neighbor in their tiny farm community comments on how Duncan is the spitting image of his mom. 

Duncan is soft, not in an effeminate way; it's just that he has an intuitiveness and a compassion that places him at odds with some of the older and rougher boys, who mock him, and call him "weird" and question his sexuality, something he's already tormented over. Was Duncan a mama's boy? Well, we're not really sure. Obviously there was incredible love between them both, but it's a love that his father is unable to replicate. 

Edgar worries about his son and he loves him dearly, but he's is clueless about how to help him. He tries to get him to help out around the farm in an effort to toughen him up. He also encourages Duncan to go out with his older friends, the ringleader of which is Perry (Tom Guiry), a butch and macho town stud who likes to brag about his sexual conquests. Perry's bravado is a cover-up for his scary feelings toward Duncan, and it's only a matter of time before their relationship reaches a crisis.

Mudge Boy is the perfect example of understatement, a tale of bourgeoning same sex attraction, and also a titular exploration of the isolation of farm life. Deeply religious, Edgar could be the fire and brimstone type of father; instead he's a thoughtful, considerate and caring man, who is at a loss at how to deal with his eccentric son. Hirsch, who projects a shy modesty, is perfectly cast as Duncan - a boy who is somewhat out of his depth with the people around him, an outcast with many quirks and eccentricities. 

At times, Mudge Boy can be difficult to watch, there's a quasi-rape scene, where the result of some teenage sexual experimentation reaches an ugly climax. But writer-director Michael Burke is always sensitive to his subject matter, beautifully rendering his protagonists' dysfunctions and setting them against a bucolic backdrop of Vermont farm land with it's meadows, tumbling down barns and cow patches.  

Whether Duncan is sweetly ingratiating himself and getting drunk with the local in crowd, or sucking on the head of his pet chicken, he's a character who many of us will probably be able to relate to. He's desperate to fit in, confused about his bourgeoning sexuality and is undoubtedly a troubled and confused soul. The final denouement, when Duncan is forced to confront the evils of small town bigotry is absolutely heart wrenching, as is the teary and world-weary reconciliation with his father. Mike Leonard May 06

Eric Stoltz give's a kick ass performance here!!

How 80's is this movie??..VERY.. which is why it rule's!!

Gotta love Elias Kotes as a skinhead punk!! he look's a bit like Henry Rollins back in the day!!

I like the storyline a lot as well...thing is though I dont know why he decided to go for his more friend of a girl as oppossed to Tomlin's charachter..maybe because he knew her better!

This a real good view into the 80's!!

SEE IT TODAY!!!

Awhile ago I was having a conversation with someone about musical tastes where we vastly disagreed on what was simply awesome bands and which ones were purely based around taste, such as people who love R&B and Rap to people who prefer Dance. In a way, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, as well as the Exorcist and the Shining are like the Beatles and Led Zeppelin of horror movies: you must love them and say anything different and you're going to get lynched. So I will agree that the film is definately refreshing considering the latest crop of so-called "horror movies", yet at the same time I wonder why it didn't hit me that much.

5 kids are travelling through the country and hear of a couple of houses. They decide to check it out only no one's home...seemingly at first. Pretty soon they meet Leatherface, a man in a burlap sac mask who wields a big fat chainsaw. Pretty soon, the kids start going one by one and we find a family seriously depraved and having to escape alive. It's odd how I can't say any more about the plot; not because of spoilers but because there's not a lot else to say.

Like many a filmgoer, I can't stand the latest releases in horror. Instead of using atmosphere, pacing and mood to creep people out, they go for broke and show some of the more violent scenes. This film isn't even gory at all. In fact, the film's goriest scene, where one of the kids meets a chainsaw, isn't even shown onscreen. Your mind fills in what went on which can probably be even more disturbing. Adding to the realism is that it's shot in a kind of documentary-like style. One problem I had with the film was that the dread didn't feel there. There was pre-MTV style editing and extreme-closeups of eyeballs and maybe I've just seen it before but it didn't creep me out like it should've(and having a woman scream for 20 minutes doesn't help).

If I saw this in 1974, I mostly likely would've been creeped out of my wits but seeing it 32 years later, it's more like "yeah it was alright although I better not say so cause then everybody will bug me about it". If you're a fan, go ahead and buy it because it's probably the best release of the film but personally, I'm not

I saw this movie on t.v. for the first time a few days ago and now I'm buying the DVD. I'm not a big fan of action movies but I do watch them now and again. I've read quite a few negative reviews about this film and I think they are undeserved. When I saw it I thought it was good, not Diehard good, but it held its own. I really enjoyed it. I really liked the idea that they included a female member of SWAT. One never sees a woman SWAT member. It looks like this is one of those movies you either love, like, or hate. One has to make up one's own mind

Gwendoline is free spirited and lots of  beauiful skin adventure  and action.
Good choice of entertainment.They need to bring back a lot of these type
movies with lots of skin and  G-rated action. Nudity mades these films very special..
If you liked Sheena or Beast Master this is a good choice

Exhilarating satirical surrealist show from Luis Buï¿½uel

I'm told by fellow film enthusiasts that Buuel's later films do not show this Spanish master at his best, that his earliest films---his famous collaborations with Salvador Dal, for instance---show an edgier, more fascinating Buuel. Whatever. I saw his 1974 film THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY for the first time recently, and I immediately fell in love with it. There are those who swear by his more popular 1972 Oscar-winner THE DISCREET CHARM OF THE BOURGEOISIE, but somehow I think THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY is even more entertaining than DISCREET CHARM.

There is no plot to speak of in PHANTOM: this film is basically a collection of surrealist sketches that finds Buuel playing with all kinds of different ideas and different images. Monks pray for a woman's sick father, and then play poker with the woman and smoke. A group of people sit around a dinner table on toilets, and go to the bathroom to eat in private. Two parents desperately try to find their missing daughter---even though she's right there in class when they call her name. In the universe Buuel concocts in THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY, anything goes.

The amazing thing about this movie is that, instead of seeming like an irrational series of surrealistic sketches, THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY has a broad theme to support its free-form structure: it's Buuel's comic vision of freedom run amuck. Sure, the idea of liberty is appealing to everyone...but, as Buuel seems to be suggesting, even freedom has its limits. The opening scene of the movie is set in Toledo, Spain in 1808, as Napoleon's troops attempt to liberate the Spanish and are greeted with cries of "Down with liberty!" There can be times when we want the assurance of authority, rather than the freedom to act in whatever way we please.

Buuel doesn't take a stand one way or the other, really; he's just an artist who is intrigued by the idea, and his interest fuels the free-form structure of the film, and its content. Almost anything and everything he can think of---within the bounds, I suppose, of the same themes he covered throughout his long and illustrious film career---is thrown into this movie, and while some viewers may perhaps prefer the comfort of a movie with some structure, I found its elegant chaos exhilarating. 

Only a master filmmaker who had absolute confidence in what he was doing would dare make a movie like this. I think Buuel pulls it off triumphantly here; somehow, he makes the movie seem almost logical, the way it progresses. THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY is a sheer delight. Highly recommended

Believe the good reviews written here about this film. I havent cared much thus far for the movies Penn has directed after this one, I suppose its because I feel this is such a great film, he created a tough act to follow, but even if he never does top it, he can rest easy knowing he has made a great film that will stand the test of time. I like long moody films that you can settle down into a couch and get absorbed into, and this is one of those. Although, I would say it could have been trimmed down just a bit, as the pace gets just a little too slow in some areas. But overall this is a great movie, with great performances by all, and it packs an after-punch in that you may not really feel how much it has moved you until its over. Im not easily touched by most movies, but this film had tears building up in my eyes ready to roll with the ending credits.  Its without a doubt one of my favorite films. This is the kind of film that reminds you, movies at there best can indeed be considered a work of art

"All men can do anything, if they will" seems to be the final statement of this captivating picture, carefully directed by Agnieszka Holland, one of the major female directors in the world.

This absorbing drama turns around the lives and times of three children who will meet each one another and exchange livings and fortunate encounters. 

On one hand, our little girl will know the world is not turning around her; and her initial solitude will be rewarded when she found out a hiddden that will make her dreams come true, and finally she will the one in order to impluse and bring back her cousin to the life.

A triumph of the cinema and definitively one of my top twenty best films of the Nineties.

This box set is worth every penny! 

This is an absolute MUST have if you meet the following eligibility requirements: 

1. You have a decent TV (at least 32") and are able to watch in the dark 

2. You have surround/stereo sound 

3. You love 3D!!!!!!

I bought this set a few years ago but unfortunately I made a BIG mistake. I bought the "Horror" collection- which works- except that the movies are horrible and hard to watch. 

Then a friend of mine turned me on to the three movies in this set recently (Encounter, Alien Adventure, Haunted Castle) and I was simply blown away. 

Now I can not stop watching these 3D movies!! 

The movies are all made by NWAVE pictures- and boy- have they done a fantastic job!!!! 

Informative, fun, and of the highest quality.....this is THE DEFINITIVE 3D package. Kids will love, and so will adults. 

Also, once you have the LCD shutter glasses, they will work on any "field sequential" 3d movie you can get your hands on. 

These movies are thrilling though- especially the non-stop coaster rides in each one. 

Do you hear what I am saying?? BUY THIS......NOW!!

You can thank me later!!! 100 stars if I could and of course..HIGHLY RECCOMENDED

If you want to see Lena Heady's breasts exposed, this is the film to watch.  But besides the numerous unnecessary topless scenes (which aren't too bad) this film is very intriguing...the human spirit tries to break through walls of addiction, frustration and isolation... now isn't that what a "suspense" drama should be about

Argento is an incarnation of everything that film is and everything that it could have been as conceived by Lumiere. After Hitchcock and Ray, Leone and Fuller, Argento is the last true auteur to make genre films. Visually, a film like Profondo Rosso calls upon the ghosts of the cinema because everything that is filmed, objects and people alike, take on the same importance and that this inevitably leads to the resolution of the mystery which is at the center of the film. Argento can only film something as itself and this is why he is an extraordinary filmmaker. Cinema is not an answer but a question and Argento is the answer to Eisenstein's theory of film as violence, violence not only in the images themselves but in the great void that awaits them. A murder, a painting, a mother, a son, a mirror, all of these things will lead to a beautiful composition of images in which the mystery of seeing, the mystery of cinema, the questions, are resolved.

Really does not get the film noir credit it deserves (probably from its title with the uninformed film watcher expecting this to be a feature starring Dinah Shore or other 1940's musical starlet.) Some very satisfying twists of the old plot make this memorable and high on the repeat viewings scale.  Gene Tierney is wonderfully mercurial - sometimes hot-hot-hot and other times just plain icy cold. This was her only Oscar nominated film and you can see why she was picked here.  See Gene in this and in "Laura" and you will see two of the best 1944 leading actress film perfomances

I was thrilled to find this set here on Amazon, and buying this set is so much cheaper then buying each volume seperatly. All of the DVD's have some good interviews with the producers, designers, voice actors, and other people associated with the show.  I don't usually like watching interviews/things where people talk a lot, but I love watching those interviews over and over and seeing the steps they took to make this show as good as it was. I totall reccomend it to anyone looking for something a little different

Henry Fonda leads an all star cast in this great classic!
When good men do nothing, evil prevails!
Watch the drama unfold and see.

One young man's life on the line
One hot and humid room
One clock counting the hours
Twelve men from different backgrounds
Twelve heated opinions
One verdict . . .

I was so pleased to find this movie on Amazon.com. I had watched it as a child and pinned over it when I could not find it in stores over the years. This is such a pure love story, with the main characters completely selfless and yet charmingly real. There are too few unpretentious, untampered romantic movies around these days. Most reveal too much- literally. But this one leaves you truly satisfied while lending pleasant modesty to a normally scandalous genre

Somehow - this movie touched my heart and my mind - and I am sure if Ben and Matt could figure out exactly what their formula was they would do it everytime.  However - it just may be one of
those once in a lifetime things - like first love - impossible
to re-capture, and in a sense, haunting.  I am not obsessive in
any way but I have watched this movie at least twenty times -
with each time revealing another layer of meaning - and with the movie becoming a place where I sometimes go for comfort.  

The synergistic combination of outstanding actors in their best roles - maybe their best ever - in combination with simply a
great story most definitely puts this movie in a special
category - so buy it and watch it.  You'll be glad you did.

This 2-disc DVD set is a must have! Herein are contained 29 classic shorts spanning from 1930 to 1947, in the first of what will likely be a 2 volume collection. Included are some of Pluto's, and Disney's best cartoons, from the Oscar winning remake "Lend a Paw," to the first appearance of Chip `N' Dale in "Private Pluto." Here is a rundown of what you get in this wonderful DVD set!

Disc 1:
The Chain Gang (1930): In this black and white Mickey Mouse short, Mickey is a prisoner in a chain gang who, after musical antics result in a riot, makes a break for it! Two bloodhounds, officially considered the first appearance of Pluto in a double role, are hot on his trail.
On Ice (1935): In this early, color Mickey Mouse cartoon, the whole gang is enjoying a day on the ice, but Donald Duck's prank playing nature puts Pluto in the spotlight.
Pluto's Quin-Puplets (1937): In this familiar classic, the first "official" Pluto short, we meet Pluto's family, as his mate, Fifi, leaves him to watch over their 5 puppies while she goes after some sausages. The outcome of which is a drunken Pluto and a fascinating paint catastrophe, resulting in some bizarre looking pups. Great short!
Beach Picnic (1939): Donald Duck, the official star of this short, sets out to have a picnic on the beach with Pluto in tow, but the day is spoiled by a familiar flypaper routine and those pesky ants! The Duck and the dog are GREAT together!
Bone Trouble (1940): Butch and Pluto battle it out over a bone here, the highlight of which is that famous funhouse mirror routine that saves the day! Great moments with Pluto in the hall of mirrors!
Pluto's Playmate (1941): While Pluto is playing with a ball on the beach, a seal takes interest and becomes determined to make friends, despite the dog's resistance. Classic type of Pluto story, to be repeated again and again in future shorts.
Canine Caddy (1941): Mickey heads out for a game of golf, but Pluto and a gopher louse things up!
Lend a Paw (1941): This Oscar winning short about kindness to animals is pure Disney magic! Surprisingly, it's a remake of a black and white Mickey short! Great story about Pluto regretfully rescuing a drowning kitten that starts to take his place in Mickey's home. Pluto's devil and angel make their most memorable appearance in this one! 
Pluto, Junior (1942): Pluto's pup, Pluto Junior, can't seem to stay out of danger, even in his own backyard!
The Army Mascot (1942): Pluto notices how well fed the local Army mascots are and decides to try to replace one of them. He foolishly chooses a grouchy goat! 
The Sleepwalker (1942): Pluto meets his second great cartoon love, Dina the Dachshund, in this classic short. However, he's more interested in hanging onto his bone than sparking romance. Too bad his sleepwalking is working against him.
T-Bone For Two (1942): Pluto and Butch the bulldog clash again, in another epic battle over a bone.
Pluto At the Zoo (1942): This excellent short is full of animal antics, as Pluto attempts to steal a bone from a lion's dish at the zoo. Love the gorilla scene!

Disc 2:
Pluto and the Armadillo (1943): On a trip to Brazil, Pluto's ball gets mixed up with a friendly Armadillo in a brief stop off between flights! Very cute short that features Mickey, too! 
Private Pluto (1943): Pluto is given orders to guard a cannon from suspected saboteurs. To our delight, those saboteurs are Chip `N' Dale in their first ever appearance! They're living in the gun and using it to crack and store their nut supply!
Springtime For Pluto (1944): This rarely seen, very colorful Pluto short is a pure delight! It's rarities like this that are the gold nuggets of the Disney Treasures series! The Pan-like Spirit of Spring awakes Pluto to a bright new day, but his enjoyment is eventually smothered by the down-sides of nature.
First Aiders (1944): Hooray, Pluto and Figaro! This short is one of those great Disney team-ups that features a star from Disney's "Pinocchio," Figaro the cat! In this old fave of mine (I love Pluto and Figaro shorts), the boys battle it out while Minnie attempts to practice her first-aid skills on them.
Dog Watch (1945): This is another fave of mine! Pluto is a Navy dog, and is given orders to keep intruders off the ship. A pesky rat causes trouble for him though, setting his sights on the ship's galley!
Canine Casanova (1945): Pluto is madly in love with Dina, but can't get her to return the sentiment, until he rescues her from the local dog pound!
The Legend of Coyote Rock (1945): Another old fave! Pluto is a sheepdog that has to fend off the legendary Bent Tail, the coyote!
Canine Patrol (1945): In this short, Pluto works for the U.S. Coast Guard and takes his job a little too seriously, doing his best to keep a cute little turtle off the beach! 
Pluto's Kid Brother (1946): K.B. can't stay out of trouble, and he badly needs big bro Pluto's help when Butch tricks him into robbing a butcher shop!
In Dutch (1946): Pluto is the local milk delivery dog in a little Dutch village. He and Dina get in trouble one day, when Pluto's wooing results in a false dike alarm sounding off. But, when the dike actually does spring a leak, it's Pluto and Dina who save the day!
Squatter's Rights (1946): Chip `N' Dale are back to torment Pluto again, when Mickey and Pluto find them living in the stove of a cabin they are vacationing in! 
The Purloined Pup (1946): A wealthy puppy has been dognapped! It's up to police dog Pluto to locate the poor pup in the hideout of the number one suspect, Butch the bulldog!
Pluto's Housewarming (1947): When Pluto is moving into a luxurious new doghouse, he discovers an unwanted houseguest in the form of that cute little turtle. He has bigger things to worry about, though, when Butch decides to move in too! 
From the Vault: Pantry Pirate (1940), separated due to ethnic stereotype content: Pluto does his best to sneak food from the kitchen without the housekeeper suspecting.
From the Vault: A Gentleman's Gentleman (1941), separated due to ethnic stereotype content: One of Pluto's best cartoons, Pluto is the perfect dog to his master, Mickey, and takes every aspect of his role very seriously, including going to the corner to buy a paper.

This is a fantastic collection of classic Disney cartoons, necessary for the Disney or Pluto fanatic! Extras include introductions from Leonard Maltin, Pluto 101 (an in-depth look into drawing and animating Pluto), The Life and Times of Pluto (a featurette about the pup himself), Pluto's Picture Book (a section of the Disneyland TV Show episode "A Story of Dogs," that focuses on the career of Pluto), Pluto's Pal Fergy (a tribute to Norm Ferguson, the animator credited with developing Pluto), fantastic photo galleries (including Sunday comics, posters, backgrounds, etc...), a DVD booklet, a certificate of authenticity, and a lovely collectible poster art card. The packaging has gone a little cheaper than past releases (no more paper wraparounds, no more printing on the back of the tin), and I'm getting more and more annoyed with only getting half-episodes of the Disneyland TV series. Will it kill `em to give us complete eps? Otherwise, another outstanding Disney Treasures set! Can't wait for the next wave, and Pluto volume 2!

Phantom Quest Corp. an action/comedy film about the drunken, karoake singing,party girl Ayaka and her friends taking on paranormal enemies, from Dracula to a possessed surgeon, mummies, and even magical monks. This Movie is a comedic romp through the world of supernatural events.

The only set backs on this flick can be that the theme songs can get a little annoying after hearing them too many times, the series is too short although it was still good. The video quality was also pretty nice, and subtitles were understandable and on que. The plot is sort of like scooby doo without the guys in masks, but more action and laughs. 

All in all this film is a great buy and worth the money spent. A great addition to any anime collection.

Most people that like Wes Anderson's films are rabid fanatics, and I'm no exception, so when the chance came to buy his first feature-length film for $7, I snapped it up. If you enjoyed Life Aquatic or The Royal Tenenbaums, you'll enjoy this, on some levels, too. Many of Anderson's classy touches are already in evidence in this film. The story is fun, and the characters are well-developed. Yeah, pretty much buy it if you like the Wilson brothers or Wes Anderson. The high point of the movie is certainly Luke Wilson's character, masterfully done even in his first role.

Fraser's film is truly a winner in production quality.   His attention to detail by bringing in his theatrical savvy is a nonpareil.  Despite all the cliches that can be stated about this film; eye-candy performers, lighting, fantastic musical score, and riske scenes, this film has visually appealing sequences.  If anyone is interested in film and theatrical production, I would highly recommend the director's commentary-you really get an insight to an artist in process.  From the commentary, it seems that Fraser will never be finished with this film: a mentale that I admire in an artist.  Art is a process and is never perfect.  

This is another one of those great modern plays that works very well for the film.   Getting to the roots of the human psyche is something films should continue into the future.  This film does explore the 3 dimensionality of people.   

I did have a problem with the didacticism of the script however.   Though most writers try to leave it up to the audience to decide, I feel that the script gave little regard for wives who are victims of their husbands having gay affairs.  I had to agree with another reviewer who titled his review as "Selfish gay guy ruins a marriage". (On the other hand, Cherilee Taylor did a great job in combating this fault with the script; she wasn't quite the victim her character ultimately could have become.)  By the end of the film, I was wondering how Violet was making it as a once again as single woman.  From an audience's standpoint, we didn't really see that.  David and Kryla make up, Matt goes to illustration school, but what happens to Violet?   

Overall, I would highly recommend this film.  With such a great interpretation on the screen, it would be nice to see this staged once again in the lort theatres.

Good mysteries but bad character arcs.  Chaotic Season 4 of CSI Miami

CSI:Miami, having evolved with some pains over the first three seasons, dips in quality in Season 4 after a very solid 3rd Season. Anyone who has watched the show realizes that Horatio, unlike Gil Grissom or Mac Taylor, is the true star of the show. The rest of the CSIs are entertaining, but the show is truly about him. This dynamic, when combined with the glamour and glitz of the Miami setting and crimes most foul, make this an entertaining CSI and reportedly the most watched show in the world.

Plotwise, season 4 gets too involved in personal character arcs to the detriment of the enjoyable crimes and mysteries. Horatio has a bizarre relationship and marriage with Delco's sister, a mole infiltrates CSI Miami, and the Mala Noche gang picks a fight that carries over into the fifth season and causes a death to someone close to Caine. These arcs were handled poorly, especially the storyline of the Mole, which when revealed was utterly anti-climactic, especially considering the Mole will be a series regular in Season 5.

Emily Proctor and Rex Linn continue to shine as Calleigh and Detective Frank Tripp. Adam Rodriguez has a sleepwalking performance as Delco, and Johnathan Togo as Ryan Wolfe does little to distinguish himself from Gregg Sanders on the Vegas cast. David Caruso contines his acting by mannerisms technique, perfecting the hands on hip move, the put on sunglasses technique, and the dramatic pauses every four syllables style that has made him the great scene chewing overactor of the year. Watching Caruso is a drinking game's worth of entertainment.

The extras of Season 4 are a bit pedestrian, with some audio commentaries, and three featurettes covering show production from shooting to post-production. If you are a fan of the show you will pre-order this one, those who don't like this CSI will be happy to know that Vegas and NYC come out within 30 days of this release.

'Big Trouble' has a lot of big things going for it...big laughs, big plot, big cast...and because of all this it loses a peg or two...for there's just sooooo much for it to keep up with itself...you get somewhat lost in the jumble.  The film stars Tim Allen in the central role, if you could call it that, as a journalist who gets himself and his son (Foster) thrown into one weirdly twisted plot involving crazed criminals (Sizemore & Knocksville) a hitman (Farina) a wealthy jerk-off of a man (Tucci), the mans wife (Russo) her daughter (Zooey) a homeless man that resembles Jesus (Lee in a histerical role) some mobsters, dimwitt cops (Garofalo & Warburton), FBI agents with attitude (Heavy-D & Epps) and a toad that sprays hallucinogenic saliva.  See all that and I haven't even got to the plot, but it's one of those things you'd have to see to really understand.  Lets just say everyone has a different agenda and they all get in each others way until everyones agenda changes to be someone elses entirly.  Does that sum it up?  It's funny, real funny, but it's also tightly woven without much room to adjust since it moves at such a frantic pace, keeping you watching closly to understand all that's going on.  It'll mae sense in the end though, I promise

This is without a doubt, one of Harrison Fords greatest moments. An incredible film with some of the best visual effects I've ever seen. Very dramatic with a lot of suspense. A very well written plot and an all star cast make this a very enjoyable experience to view. A film you will want to see again and again. Action, mystery, drama, thriller. There are a lot of goofs in this film if you are into looking for such, but they don't in any way detract from the overal quality of this very well done suspense drama. I highly recommend it

The synopsis ...
Sam and Jonah Baldwin, father and son, have lost the most important woman in their lives to cancer.  Seeking to escape from the painful memories that lurk in every nook and cranny of Chicago, they move to Seattle.  Eighteen months later, Jonah can sense that his dad is still sad; and, in desperation calls a nationally syndicated radio self-help guru on Christmas Eve to wish for his father a new wife.  Annie Reed lives in Baltimore and is engaged to Walter.  Their relationship, while loving and comfortable, is entirely devoid of romantic sparks.  When Annie hears Jonah's soulful plea on the radio, it's as if her heart has been touched by "magic" and she is determined to find out why she feels so powerfully drawn to Sam and his son ... even if it means traveling across "like 26 states".

The critique ...
Sleepless in Seattle is a brilliantly simple film; that's what makes it so great.  To quote Nora Ephron, "It isn't a movie about love, it's a movie about love in the movies."  To emphasize this point, she incorporates various parallel references to "An Affair to Remember" throughout the film; but, Sleepless is also a movie about our genuine romantic fantasies and sentimental ideals about falling in love (which, let's admit it, have been undeniably shaped by what we've seen on the silver screen).  The script is refreshingly candid, yet endearing and Nora Ephron's direction is impeccable.  Ross Malinger, cast as Jonah Baldwin, is the youngest and most notable talent in the film.  He does an excellent job of portraying THE quintessential eight-year-old; he's impulsive, moody and thinks he knows it all.  (I speak from experience here folks; I currently have a son that age.)  He and Tom Hanks come together flawlessly as father and son; so successfully in fact, that they would be utterly convincing off screen.  The chemistry between Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks is equally amazing, which is no small achievement considering the fact that they rarely appear together in a scene.  The supporting cast is brimming with talent and includes Rosie O'Donnell, Bill Pullman, Rita Wilson, Rob Reiner, David Hyde Pierce, and a young Gaby Hoffmann.  Families with younger children will appreciate the film's integrity; there is very little foul language ("God damn it" and " ... it scared the shit out of me ..." being the worst of it) and no "sexual content" to be wary of.  All around, this is a winning film.  One that I find myself watching over and over and over again.

The DVD ...
For a 10th Anniversary Edition, the special features are few and rather disappointing.  You've got your basic director commentary, a music video ("When I Fall in Love" by Celine Dion & Clive Griffin), and a "Love in the Movies" Featurette.  This last piece is approximately 15 minutes long.  It features the director, producers,	actors and the hosts of Loveline: Drew Pinsky and Adam Carolla (why they are included, I don't know) talking about "Love in the Movies."  There are some interesting interview segments with an Empire State Building Historian and some very beautiful shots of the New York skyline before 9/11; but there's certainly nothing here to write home about.  By far, the most exciting feature is that you can choose your aspect ratio.  (And honestly, how exciting is that?)  This a DVD that you buy for the film alone.

I loved this  DVd set! Grew up watching it..and remember running home after school to catch each days episodes. Watching this  set transported me back to another time, when things were peaceful and less frazzeled! Stayed up till 2 am watching it all and felt like that little kid from school again! Like many young girls back then I was 'in love' with Tim Considine! So nice to see he and David back talking about it! I hope Disney Co. will put out the next 2 series of this great show on DVD soon

After being into the "techno" scene since my first party in 1993, this is one of the best videos I have seen describing the DJ feelings. You really get a feel for how a DJ thinks. If you at all interested in the DJ lifestyle or are interested in DJing this is a must have. It have great insights in the minds of some of the best DJs around. Plus Nigel Richards does a great job with the "How to DJ" part. Not only is this for the "newbies" but for those who have been around a bit. Plus he makes learning fun with his comments and body mannerisms. WOW that sounded like an infomercial

I followed Texhnolyze through it's fansubs, waited patiently for each DVD to come out.
You don't have to sit and ponder, look hard and deep to find a meaning in Texhnolyze.  It hits you right in the face from the beginning.
There are some people out there that society likes to forget.  Likes to shove to the backburners and ignore.  In this tale, they are a whole race of people - the people of the underground city of Lux.
And even within them, sides are chosen.  You're either in or your out.  Ichise is one of these outcasts and he lives by what he knows.  The only thing he knows - his strength, his brute force.
This point is particularly brought out in one of the last episodes, when Ichise makes the decision to protect Ran.  He's come to feel something for the girl and, perhaps, in a way she reminds him of the mother he could never save.  So he goes to offer the only thing he's sure of having - his body.  That's always been his bargaining chip, always been what everyone wanted.
Anger, rage and fighting.  Though are all Ichise knows.  How do you expect him to act any less animalistic than the animal this society made him become?  It's clear through most of the show that he doesn't know how to react to people.
Likewise, it's the same old sort of theme out of many a popular sci-fi movie - man bringing about an end to his own world.  Ichise inadvertantly is thrust into all of this by his texhnolyze, Ran is thrust by her visions and everyone else by some intricate connection.  But eventually, Lux collapses because of technology, the classic warning given in so many Apocalypse movies.

Not each episode requires such in-depth searches for meaning.  It all fits into the grandier scheme and message of the series itself.  This series, as a whole, is a very good series.  It does require connecting together pieces and keeping larger themes in mind, as well as a little psychology but what good series /doesn't/

I finally found out this was out on DVD after having the VHS version for many years.  The DVD edit is very close to the VHS version minus the glitch during the scorpions opening act, plus some video strobing added during Cindy Lauper's run down the runway, which I'm not sure was really needed, but I'm ok with it, although the video strobing was done again later, which seems to me as a cheap effect, that really doesn't add to the performance.

I think Brian Adams and Cindy was excellent for the parts they portraid.  I thought originally sinaed (sp? whatever) was a strange choice at the time, maybe good for the part, but after seeing the documentary, I see her being a good intention decision at the time that ended up biting them in the end.  She's too instable, and apparently did not realize the importance of such an event, nor did she show any respect for the part.  Speaking of which, all of those artists that were called to perform at this event, and didn't say Yes on the first call.... shame on you.  If Roger calls you for an event, you say YES, and put whatever you're doing aside, because this was way too big of an event to try to be politically correct with.

I wish there were more documentary material with this DVD, as this was such a big event, there should have been more information.  I had heard in an interview before the show that Roger was once asked if he'd ever do the wall again, and he basically said "If the berlin wall would ever come down, then I would consider doing it again", and this was never mentioned in the Doc.

Buy the video, even if you have the VHS, you'll enjoy it.

... Still waiting for Pulse to be released as well, enjoy!

I normally do not enjoy movies about the making of movies, so I was very pleasantly surprised to be thoroughly entertained by 'Living in Oblivion'.  The reason I took the chance at all was due to the presence of Catherine Keener, one of our most overlooked and under-appreciated Hollywood actresses.  She once again did not disappoint, but the entire cast was extremely good.  You get a real education on the frustrations and challenges involved with making a low budget film.  Buscemi is also right on target as the stessed out director.  The Amazon reviews are for the most part positive about this film and for good reason.  I'm glad to join my fellow Amazonians in heaping praise on this low budget gem

I am a huge Muppet fan, and was very excited to have the opportunity to get a newer, remastered version of this classic. While the quality is not too much better than the original DVD release, it is definitely worth adding to your collection, especially if you don't have any version of The Movie yet!

This dvd does not claim to contain a debate about the origins of Christianity; it discusses an alternate viewpoint (as Dan Brown reminds us "the winners write the history books")This dvd is a nice antidote to all the oppressive ideas we have been raised with; esp. the idea of God as male, and the idea of women being unworthy of church leadership. This dvd includes interviews with Dan Burstein, Henry Lincoln, Martin Lunn, Lynn Picknett, Clive Prince, Dr. Karen Ralls, Dr. James Robinson, and Margaret Starbird. I particularly liked Margaret Starbird's interviews - she describes how when she first read "Holy Blood, Holy Grail", she found it blasphemous because she had been raised a loyal Catholic. But afterward, she had religious experiences regarding the content of that book which lead her to research Mary Magdalene and write "The Woman with the Alabaster Jar". She comes across as very rational, sensible and even heroic. It takes courage to contradict the dearly held beliefs of the majority. I thought Dan Burstein also made some very good points with his discussions about the lives and customs of Jewish people during the time Jesus lived. I think this dvd is an important reminder that just because you have been taught something all your life - that doesn't mean it is necessarily the truth. To be truly alive is to continue to search for the truth as long as you live

I saw this movie in the 1986 theatrical re-release and subsequently on DVD. I can readily attest that it does not age! I'm not even a dog person myself, but the plot is not about dogs per say, but the life adventures that a young cocker spaniel named Lady has. 

Living with owners named Darling and Jim Dear, Lady apparently leads a pretty good life. Assuming that every dog leads the good life she and her friends enjoy, she is later shocked to meet Tramp, who lives on the streets. However, she soon realizes that he has a good heart beneath that rough exterior. 

She needs his help when crusty old Aunt Sarah comes to mind the house--and the newborn baby. Initially not understanding that Lady feels protective towards the baby, she also selectively ignores the damage which her two Siamese cats were actually responsible for doing to that very elaborate Victorian house. 

Amazingly, Aunt Sarah presumes that Lady was responsible for wrecking the house--and attempts to muzzle her up!

Like any streetwise character, Tramp has lots of connections and solutions to any problem which pops up. However, he does not come across as an annoying know-it-all who you would want to quickly get rid of. Tramp is instead somebody whom we are supposed to both identify and then want to hang out with in rough environments. Lady had 'gentle' friends named Jock and Trusty, but they can't help out in a world also outside of their own.   

Of course, the spaghetti dinner scene remains one of the most enduring of all time--it made a VERY profound impact on me well before I was even old enough to myself consider dating. I imagined that I would eventually share a romantic dinner of my own with my own "Mr. right". 

However, Tramp's decision to go after the rat in the nursery also remains a powerful scene. He then felt no loyalty to anybody in that family other than Lady, but saved the baby anyway! Tramp proved that class is not a matter of breeding but what you do with your self! 

Despite his earlier professed discomfort with collars, Tramp ultimately gets adopted by the Darlings. Therefore, he and Lady do in fact live happily ever after.

Attila was a 2001 mini series which won the honor of being the most watched mini-series of its day. It features a stellar cast including Powers Boothe as a crafty Roman leader who tries to use Attila to gain possession of Rome.

Gerard Butler is Attila, the Hun,and he is everything about Attila in this role, never was an actor better suited. His character is sharp, passionate, determined and has an instant magnatism that keeps the viewer glued to the film. He brings a strong intensity and subtle gentleness to the character which makes watching him clash with Boothe even more dynamic.

This is a definite watch for anyone that likes period piece drama or just really well staged war scenes

I saw this movie for one reason: I wanted to see Gerard Butler in something other than Phantom Of The Opera just to see how he played a "normal" role. I've never been a big fan of "chick flicks" (for instance, my friend and I watched A Walk To Remember awhile ago, and the only thing that kept us from laughing throughout was the constant threat of being slapped by one of the girls in the room). That said, Dear Frankie is a thoroughly entertaining film that has a surprisingly deep plot and keeps going at a fast enough pace that you never get bored. Initially I had trouble understanding what the actors were saying (they all have thick accents), but once I got used to it I had no problems through the rest of the movie

Since "ER" debuted on NBC in 1994, it's taken the nation by storm.  It's wonderfully produced by author Michael Chricton,  a former surgeon before his writing career.  For numerous years, it was the #1 drama series on television.  The show starts with the cast of Anthony Edwards (Mark Greene), George Clooney (Doug Ross), Sherry Stringfield (Susan Lewis), Noah Wyle (John Carter), Julianna Margulies (Carol Hathaway), and Eriq La Salle (Peter Benton).  It has since won and been nominated for several awards including Emmys.  Its hospital action combined with personal drama always draws audiences deeply into every scene for every episode.  Its emergency scenes grown in intensity and drama through the episodes.

Season one introduces the everyday life in the ER in Chicago.  Throughout, it explores many critical issues including Hathaway's self-destruction that results in a suicide attempt, Carter struggling as a medical student, Ross living his sex obsessed life, and others.  Regular show viewers who haven't seen season one will see part of Lewis's reason for leaving Chicago in 1996, Greene in his first marriage and before Ella's birth (mother is Corday, who began in 1997), Deb Chin's (played by Ming Na) brief time in that ER as a medical student before returning as an official doctor in 2000, and many others.  Such combination shows partially how the show's theme evolved to today.  Episode by episode, the plot's quality stays on top.  The overall scenery, through the physical environment to the emotional drama, never fails to compile the unforgettable viewing experience.

Season two features the debuts of Gloria Reuben (Jeanie Boulet) and Laura Innes (Kerry Weaver, not an official cast member until season 3).  This season explores Ross's most heroic act as a doctor, Carter becoming a doctor, Lewis being forced to care for her neice, and many more.  Today's viewers who haven't seen season two will witness Boulet before testing positive for HIV, Weaver before realizing her lesbianism, Hathaway before her today's happy life (though now in Seattle), and others.  This plot evolves very well in quality from the previous season.  It continues its run of staying on top in critical care and drama.

Both seasons feature wonderful acting from the entire cast.  All add their own sense of individual theme into every scene.  Through personal struggles, drama, and continually saving lives, everyone gives the show its unique viewing flavor.

Such show quality makes "ER - The Complete First Two Seasons" worthy for all fans.  This is sure to please its audiences.  New viewers should watch these two seasons first.  Otherwise, the plot will be confusing.  Fans should watch for season 3 to be released on video in the near future

Mira Nair produced a film which is very entertaining, magical, and realistic in how it portrays the stresses and experiences associated with planning a modern wedding in India. The bride is a college educated beauty who has some liberated ideas and behaviors  ... but she is also the the only daughter of her parents, a child of her culture. She agrees to an arranged marriage to the handsome son of a friend of the family... after a failed love affair (first secret in the film) from which she is not yet fully recovered. Aditi feels ready for marriage, so she tells her unmarried female cousin Ria who has some doubts about the matter. The unique traditions of the past are combined with modern touches - the past and present intertwine in unexpected ways to produce a beautiful and creative collage of whacky entertainment. The street scenes filmed in New Delhi symbolically represent the chaotic atmosphere, tensions and pressures of the preparations for a wedding. The plans are to create a joyous celebration ... to be remembered by both families ...and cherished for a lifetime. Family arrived from America, Dubai, and Australia ... to celebrate the blessed union of two young people in marriage.

Lalit Verma, father of the bride takes his role seriously, his personality, character, and approach provide many of the comic and serious touches in the film. He displays extraordinairy sensitivity to a family tragedy that is unexpectedly revealed (the second secret) and takes courageous action to deal with the problem directly. He proves to be a caring, loving father whose integrity ensures the wedding preparations continue as planned, allowing nothing to mar the perfection of the moment. He even asks for a temporary loan from business associates to meet mmediate "cash flow" problems as the costs keep mounting upwards. The casting for all the roles are superb. The music was incorporated into the story of the film, enhancing and emphasizing the emotions in many scenes. There was spontaneous singing during the "mehndi" ceremony when the women paint henna designs on the hands of the bride. There was a haunting solo sung about the bride leaving the loving palace of her father ... to become a stranger to his house forever after marriage. Several enjoyable modern Indian techno sounds exploded throughout the film making the scenes more lively and enjoyable. 

Along with the wedding, there are several stories interwoven within the fabric of the film ... The first and most important one is how the wedding plans for Aditi and Hermant could have unravelled after Aditit confessed her secret affair to him. While the two large tents are built in the backyard, garlands of marigolds {"the flower of love") are woven, and the cost of water-proofing the tents is being negotiated - P.K. Dubey, the cell-phone carrying, dot.com business entrepeneur wedding event manager, and *bachelor* falls in love with Alice, the young maid and housekeeper for the Verma family. Meanwhile, Varun, Aditi's brother practices a dance he will perform at the 'sangeet' (engagement party?) with Ayesha, a very attractive cousin from Dubai. However, just before the party he clashes with his parents over his future educational plans. They decided he will be sent to a boarding school. Ayesha has been flirting with Rahul, a handsome young relative of the Verma's from Australia. They have even exchanged kisses in the dark. He had witnessed her dance sessions with Varun who now refuses to do the performance. When Rahul will not take Varun's place, one of the older ladies overhears and quotes poetry to him about his failure to rescue a lady in distress. She tells him straight up to get off his @ss ... Some of the most sensitive scenes include Ria, when she clues in on certain behaviors between Uncle Tej and Aleja, a young girl of about 6 or 7. Ria exposes Uncle Tej and at the same time reveals her own shame at having suffered a similar fate as a child. Lalit wrestles with how to handle this delicate situation. He couragously banishes Uncle Tej and his wife from his house. The wedding ceremony is a blessed and dignified event. It turns out to be perfect, a celebration of pure joy ... exactly as planned.

This is an outstanding documentary of the campaign team that changed presidential campaigning.  One does not need to love the results of these changes (I personally believe that this campaign was the beginning of the end of democracy as we know it, even as I marveled at the talent and loved the outcome of the election) to appreciate how Clinton's 1992 campaign, as seen in this film, changed the American political world. 

"War Room" should be seen along with more recent documentaries (like, for example, "Staffers '04") to see the difference between a campaign that used techniques to achieve a goal and campaigns that use the same techniques as the goal (to be elected rather than to govern).  Hopefully, it will encourage you to do what you can to return political campaigns to discussions of ideas rather than the useless, mind-numbing, dumbing down assessments of candidate traits (like "character" or "integrity") we seem to have resorted to in the past ten years

This original version is much funnier than U.S. version. The humor is dry and intelligent, and the characters are very complex: at times, you feel sorry for them; other times, you love them and laugh with them; and mostly, you think they're idiots. What a talented group of actors and comedians to create such a complexity of emotion in an audience. 

It's not often I can watch a DVD or series over and over, but this is one that I've enjoyed each time

We started with "There Goes a Dump Truck" which actually features a different "Dave."  This first Dave was in the Dumptruck, Tractor and Farm Truck versions - maybe a few others - and is pretty unbearable for parents as far as how silly he is. The newer Dave (Dave Hood) is in all the rest (along with his sidekick, Becky, in some) and is much less goofy than the other Dave.  I don't think the kids really care though...the sillier the better and my son loves them both. 
Anyway, I started with the dumptruck one when my son was almost 2 and he was immediately glued to the TV.  I don't let him watch cartoons and try to limit overall TV to things that are at least somewhat informative/educational.  As a result, he was never one to sit and watch much TV (made it hard for me to get things done!).  But, with this series, he enjoyed watching the real live machines and vehicles (and some of the more goofy moments) so much.   It really was a lifesaver at times.  Needless to say it didn't take long for me to collect the entire series.  I have watched them along with him and learned quite a bit about different occupations.  My in-laws were farmers and really enjoyed watching the "Tractor" and "Farm Truck" versions with him. 
His favorites include "There goes a Firetruck," "There goes a Monster Truck" and "There goes a Spaceship."  But, he literally rotates through all of them and has over the past year plus!  
I can't say enough good things about the video series as far as my son's enjoyment goes.  Just don't look for any oscars for the acting and editing.  It's pretty choppy, even for an amateur eye. 
I would highly recommend any in this series if your child likes any type of machine or vehicle.

All the great reviews written previously say it all - Anne of Green Gables the movie is a timeless classic of the classic novel. I've been watching this movie since I've been a child, and I still watch it as an adult. A movie like this doesn't need "special features" for it to be attractive as a DVD(Although the commentary is great!). Just the fact that no matter how long I keep this and how often I watch this movie, it won't change like VHS does.

Having visited St. Petersburg, Russia a year ago, I could not pass up the chance to watch this movie.  I must say, it was nicely done.  I can relate to the obnoxious, business like brother...who happily did not go with me on my trip.  I was more like the care-free younger brother, but not quite so care-free as the character protrayed.  The scenery was awesome...all the fantastic architecture of those magnificent buildings and sculptures were in the movie...although I wish there were more because the city is full of beauty.  And this goes for the women as well!!  I mainly went to see the city...but I also went there as a very confirmed bachlor to meet a lady that I planned would be my travel companion.  What I didn't expect was to really fall in love :-).  The BIG reason why I confirmed myself to be a life time bacholar was my exposure to American women...as if explained in the additional extras on the DVD...but the Russian lady that I met there and the culture of her up-bringing quickly changed my way of thinking!!  One thing I should add though.  The movie gave the impression that you can take her home with you when you go back to the states yourself.  Such is not the case.  It takes paperwork and a lot of patience to get her here...expect at least 8 months, but it is more like a year.  It is time consuming to get her a US visa.  But she was worth the wait for me and if you want a life long partner and lover, the wait is worthwhile.  Another word of caution:  Prepare yourself to fall in love with Russia...the people are very nice and I know of a lot of Americans who go there quite often to visit and re-visit...some even live there now

I saw this movie twice, the second time knowing exactly why I wanted to see it again. If you are trying to find out if you love someone or not, make sure that you see this movie. Such a simple but yet such a powerful definition of love it gives. Explains why we are where we are, and makes you part of the harmony. Is love as simple as teaching someone to bike? Think about it. 

If there are no rules against it, this film should be renominated for Oscar.

I remember watching this in high school. I thought it was great fun then and my kids think it still is now. Okay, we're not talking Academy award material here (Emmy?).

Ralph, Bill, & Pam are back for the third and final season of this far too short series about a man who is given a suit by aliens that gives him super powers. He is teamed with an FBI agent to help the world survive itself. In the first few minutes Ralph looses the instruction book and must noodle out how to operate the suit. He runs into a few walls, literally. The first season was a little rough. The second season fleshed out the concept. This third season started to stretch its legs but the show was cancelled.

I have looked for years for novels based on the show, to no avail. I even contacted Cannell to ask if I could write them. As Disney is half-heartedly working on a feature film based on the show Cannell wouldn't cut loose with permission. Alas, It would've been fun.

Anyway, if you have the other two seasons you'll love this one. The only complaint/change I would make is having to play the theme song before each episode. I would've made it so you could hit the "forward to next" button and go right to the action. Also, the jacket plays a bit of the theme song. I wish they'd made it possible to change the batteries.

This DVD gives a very good 60 minute workout. As others have pointed out the cardio is very dancy. The first time I did it, I felt a bit awkward with the steps, but when I did it the second time I was able to follow along with no problems. The dance moves are a fun change up from my usual routine. If someone like Denise Austin were leading this one, I don't think I would play along. Minna is by far my favorite instructor, so I go along with it and it ends up being a fun workout. I wouldn't want to do this every day, but it is good to have something different in the rotation.

I think the toning section is excellent. I am not looking to bulk up. I just want my body to firm up and look better when I wear shorts and a tank top. I like how she combines upper and lower body exercises. It's easy to follow and you feel like you hit every muscle area in 30 minutes. I use 3 pound weights at this point and I can see where in the future I might be buying 4 pound weights. 

Minna is a great instructor. She has excellent cueing and is very encouraging. She is never annoying. I also have her Optimizer- Balanced Blend DVD and I love that one.

When Kerouac, Ginsberg, and Burroughs set out in their writing, they had no idea what it would create - a whole movement.  This film, including  interviews taken when Ginsberg and Burroughs were alive, assembles clips  from media, film, and personal account to show the beginnings of the beats  up to the passing-away of Ginsberg and Burroughs.  With a large assembly of  other beat writers and the poets they influenced (Carroll and Bukowski), it  is an extensive study to a misunderstood movement.  It is interesting to  see the Beat propaganda of the sixties, how negative and mocking the media  treated the sense of a &quot;cool&quot; movement; they painted a false  portrait.  This film is for lovers of Beat or people genuinely interested.   However, if you do not like documentaries, you won't like this one.  Also,  I was disappointed to see Depp, Hopper, and Turturro reciting long pieces  of work when the actual writers could have performed it.  Honestly, I  skipped these parts.  I wanted to see Ginsburg doing &quot;Howl.&quot;   Another disappointment is the DVD version, which was slapped together on  the fly.  I envisioned additional clips and useful information (let's face  it, you can put TONS on a DVD), but only had 2 or 3 screens of names  credited for making the movie and the trailer (in this case, not exciting).   However, with all disappointments aside, this film is good for a few  viewings.  It conveys a better picture of the Beats than other films have  before and enjoyed alot of the material

Hello, fellow "Amazon'ers" out there in cyber-land :)

I grew up in the MI TV series era.  As a TV/DVD collector of primarily 60's-80's series and member of a couple of TV/DVD forums on the 'net, I can mention to all of the "Amazon'ers" out there that this is a gem that we've been wanting on DVD for years.  As for some of the "Cruise" posts, I saw the 1st MI film and, as others mentioned here, it's somewhat like comparing "apples and oranges".  From a TV/DVD collectors point of view, we want the (TV-series remake) films released, since in a lot of cases, the studios will release the original TV/DVD series as a market "tie-in" coinciding with the film release.  TV/DVD collectors may not purchase the film on DVD but in a lot of cases, the film "gets the job done" for the TV series release.  My favorite season of this series was S1.  I liked Steven Hill in the IMF Force Team Leader role just a little better than Peter Graves although I thought Graves did an outstanding job in the role after Hill left the series.  I also liked the original script line of  "Please dispose of this recording in the usual manner".  :)  What can we say about the "Landau/Bain" team on this show?  Classic!  And, what a casting jackpot for Greg Morris in the "tech/electronics genius" role :)

This series is a must-buy for most of the TV/DVD collectors out there.  It's simply-put, a "sure thing" gem for your collection.  I only hope that additional seasons will make it to their release[s].  As the saying goes, "It's all about the #'s" (sales #'s).  Hopefully, this set will sell well on the 'net stores and your local outlets.

"As always, should any of your DVD's dislodge from their hubs in transit, the Shipper will disavow any knowledge of their existance". :)

Signing off from Dallas, TX  "This poster may self-destruct in 5 seconds" :

I lived through the vietnam era.  IF you did you can't ever forget.  This guy was right in the middle of the crucial decisions that brought the debacle down on us.  Here he sifts through the sands of his memory and tries to synthesize how it went wrong, why it went wrong and what we can learn to KEEP FROM REPEATING IT.  

For me, here was the most unforgettable moment.  Decades later he returns to vietnam and winds up sitting at a formal dinner next to his north vietnamese counterpart from those days.  Macnamara tells him we--the americans--were not a colonial power seeking to impose our will but were fighting to stop the spread of communism, seeing north vietnam as a tentacle of communist china.  The north vietnamese official gaped at him and then began pounding the table and said, "Mr. Macnamara, you must have never read a history book!  We've been FIGHTING the chinese for a thousand years!  We aren't their puppet!  We were fighting for our national freedom!  We would have fought to the last man!"  Macnamara says they almost came to blows.

Here's the point.  Macnamara says, as compared to say the soviets, we didn't understand the north vietnamese.  We didn't really know enought about them.  We had no idea what was in their minds.  And that was why we wound up fighting the wrong war against the wrong country and for the wrong reasons!  That's why we lost!

Does any of this sound familiar??????  

This is a fantastically good piece of work that ought to be required viewing for every american of voting age.  It's that good and that informative.  Of course, it won't be widely viewed by the american public.  We'll go our goofy way coveting our big-screen tvs and gas guzzling cars and spending our time on important things--like sporting events

Barbershop is a rare event in African-American filmmaking. It's one of the few that actually tells a fairly accurate story of what life is like for African-Americans. I love the fact that the movie showed how diverse the African-American community is; we see black people from different walks of life and different lifestyles shown onscreen. I really liked this movie. We definitely need more films like this
Calvin is the owner of a Chicago Barbershop passed on to him by his late father. Mired in debt from the shop and his crazy business schemes, Calvin is desperate to start something of his own and feels that the barbershop is a hindrance on his life. It's not until he sells the barbershop to a loan shark that he realizes the value of the shop to the community and sees a role for himself in the neighborhood. There are a dozen other stories that link to this main one and they're all easy to follow. One follows a stolen ATM machine, one follows the quest for love of an African immigrant, another follows a female barber and her cheating boyfriend, another follows a guy desperate for a haircut to go to a job interview, and yet another follows a white barber's quest for acceptance by the black barbers he works with. In a way, this film reminded me of those great ensemble movies like Pulp Fiction that follow many characters and their stories. Each of the stories lead up to the ending where Calvin saves the barbershop.
Director Tim Story does a great job of capturing life in Chicago and the informal environment of the barbershop. I felt the spirit of the Windy City and the informal environment of the barbershop. Watching the conversations in the movie reminded me of the barbershop in Harlem my father used to take me to when I was a boy. It also reminded me of the charged atmosphere of the old barbershop I used to go to get my flat-top trimmed (Both are closed now.) :( 
There are a ton of great performances in this movie; I'm probably going to miss mentioning a few people. Ice Cube is great as Calvin. I liked his performance here. Michael Ealy stands out in his role as an ex-con trying to turn his life around by becoming a barber. Ealy makes you feel his characters' desperation. Cedric the Entertainer makes a breakthrough performance as an old barber. He's funny and poignant. Sean Nelson is great as an educated man who works as a barber while going to college. Anthony Anderson and Larenz Tate are hilarious as two bumbling thieves who steal an ATM with no money in it. Watching them try to open will make you laugh. Keith David is creepy as the loan shark. Then again, Keith David is always good in anything he does. I'd pay money to watch him and Sam Jackson read listings in the yellow pages.
I don't know why Movie Critics and the Rev. Jesse Jackson denounced Barbershop, it's one of the best movies ever made about African-American life. Looking at the box office of Barbershop and Diary of a Mad Black Woman, African-Americans actually WANT more films like this. As a black moviegoer I want different black films that allow the world to see the whole community, not just one small part of it. I for one and tired of the "Hood" movies like Never Die Alone, and Critically acclaimed movies like Monster's Ball and Hustle & Flow that depict black life as something negative. (Thankfully, it seems the rest of the black community is tired of these types of movies too, the box office and DVD sales for them is declining while the box office for movies like Barbershop and Diary of a Mad Black woman are going up.) End of rant, back to the review.
A Shawn James essential Five Star video. You must buy this movie. Get some friends together put the DVD in the machine, Pull up a chair and have a seat in front of the TV and hang out at the Barbershop.

   The caribou population is declining at an alarming rate and the Canadian government is concerned.  After a harrowing and kind of funny plane flight with tundra pilot Brian Dennehy government researcher Tyler is dropped in the frozen middle of nowhere.  It's a `kind of' funny plane flight because it's so well done.  Dennehy is a hung over, buckaroo bonzai type independent flyer.  His little prop plane, heavily laden with Tyler's (Charles Martin Smith) equipment, has a tough time both taking off and, later, staying afloat.  The in-flight repairs Dennehy makes had me on the edge of my seat - although the photography is the great strength of NEVER CRY WOLF, the acting - especially by Smith - and the editing are also nearly perfect. As harrowing as the plane ride is it's a pretty safe bet the plane will land (elsewise there'd be no movie) and Tyler will find survival, rather than research, is the pressing order of business.

 Tyler is there to locate a wild wolf pack, kill one or two of the pack members, and dissect them to discover if, as suspected, their stomachs contain an inordinate amount of healthy caribou meat.  Tyler, laden with crates of light bulbs and toilet paper, is materially and constitutionally unprepared for setting up a research station on his own.  Fortunately for him he'll be discovered, rescued, and befriended by two Inuits - the ancient Ootek (Zachary Ittimangnaq) and his adopted son, Mike (Samson Jonah.)  As Tyler notes in his voice-over narration, there are no orphans among the Inuit.  Ootek and Mike will arrive and disappear a few times, a wolf pack will be found, and Tyler will learn that man's relationship to the wolf is many times more complex than he imagined.

 I dislike most message movies.  They tend to distort characters and events, and beat you over the head until you accept their point of view.  NEVER CRY WOLF has a strong message about man and nature, but it's such an entertaining movie I didn't feel like I needed to join the Sierra Club to enjoy it.  The story lines are clear, and after the plane trip its plentiful humor is quiet and unforced.  Smith, who spends an awful lot of the movie alone, acting under his voice-over narration, is nuanced and convincing. Jorah and, especially, Ittimangnaq, are both good and both add a layer of authenticity to the film. And the photography is at times breathtaking.  NEVER CRY WOLF is a gem.

VERY GOOD GHOST MYSTERY!

"The Changeling" has become a little bit dated, however, it is still a very good ghost story. The film stars (George C. Scott) as John Russell, a composer who has lost his family in a tragic accident. He rents a large estate in order to compose his music. It is here that he encounters the ghost of a young boy. Why is the boy haunting the estate? Why is he making contact with John Russell? As the film moves forward, John Russell contacts a medium and eventually begins to investigate the mansion.

From what he can gather, it was the former home of Senator Carmichael (Melvin Douglas). What ensues is the mystery of who the child is, and who is Senator Carmichael. What occurred in the mansion that is keeping this child there? This is more of a mystery than a horror film. The suspense of the film is through the nuances the director created by use of creepy sounds and effects in which the boy's wheelchair moves. The film is dated, and does not have the appeal it once had for me, however, it is still a good watch. Recommended.

Audrey, without Givenchy, and only a portion of her face visible, few lines and much conflict gives one of the great performances.  The depth of the movie, the richness, amount to a great piece of art.  Certainly, the movie is not "fun," but it attests to a time when a movie about the struggle with faith could be a blockbuster

Walt Disney's Best Movie

Disney made its mark as a major studio in 1937 with its first full-length feature film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. Ironically, given this early success, Snow White was their only hit movie for the next 13 years. World War II kicked the hell out of Disney's overseas markets. Even movies today regarded as classic Disney - Pinnochio, Bambi, Fantasia - lost money on initial release. Disney eked through by diversifying into training films for the US government, and the South American films that were part of FDR's Good Neighbor policy, etc. - stuff that made back its costs but not much more. By 1948, Disney was in dire financial straits. They had just enough money for one more movie. Walt Disney realized he needed a hit or his studio probably wouldn't survive, and it would have to be what they did best: a full-length animated feature film. Walt said to himself, "What we need is a movie about a girl in trouble. Audiences love that. They loved Snow White." That's what he wanted: a movie like Snow White, but even more so - more comedy, more drama, more magic, more music, more lovable characters. He chose as the basis of his company's Hail Mary pass arguably the most famous fairy tale in the world: Cinderella.

Disney didn't have the money, as they had on earlier films, to lavishly storyboard every scene. Thus they hit upon the wonderfully clever idea of shooting the entire movie in live action, then the animators used stills from that as storyboards. The photos used survive to this day, and many are provided as a Special Edition "extra." In some cases these photos have the animator's drawings over them, turning for instance an almost bare stage into a hall in Cinderella's family chateau.

In 1950, Cinderella was released and was everything Disney so desperately needed. Even today, Cinderella is arguably the best movie Disney's ever made. It's just awfully hard to argue with any aspect of this film. The animation artwork was a product of Disney's famous "Nine Old Men" - at that time not yet old. Cinderella pulls off, superbly, something not particularly easy to do: it integrates believable human characters with funny cartoon animals and makes it work. From Eric Larson and Marc Davis' beautiful and graceful Cinderella to Ward Kimball's wonderful Jaq and Gus-Gus the mice and over-the-top Lucifer the cat, everything flows together so well it all seems perfectly natural.

Part of Walt Disney's plan to out-Snow White Snow White with Cinderella involved its music. He very consciously wanted Cinderella to be a source of hit songs. There had been hit songs from Disney films before ("Heigh Ho" and "Whistle While You Work" from Snow White, "When You Wish Upon a Star" from Pinnochio, etc.) but they'd been almost accidental. "Oh, we have a hit song, well that's nice." For Cinderella, Disney for the first time went to Tin Pan Alley (28th Street in New York City where the professional songwriters could be found). Disney wanted his girl's music done by the very best craftsmen, the guys who wrote hit songs for a living. The Cinderella soundtrack hit big (a #1 album with 3/4 million units sold) with songs even today considered quintessential Disney, most notably "A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes" from the movie's opening scene, "The Work Song" while the animals help Cinderella clean the house and simultaneously build her ball gown, and "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo" (nominated for an Academy Award as best movie song of the year) from the Fairy Godmother transformation scene.

For their best movie, Disney apparently spared no expense producing the DVD. Not only has the picture quality been digitally restored, but the audio has also been cleaned up with a new 5.1 surround sound mix. Totally gone is the background hiss associated with so many old movies. (Cinderella has the distinction of being "the noisiest movie ever restored" according to its audio crew.) The original mono soundtrack has also been spruced and is provided as an option for purists.

A word about the movie's aspect ratio (i.e. how wide the picture is compared to its height). The DVD cover says Cinderella is presented in its "Original Full-Screen Aspect Ratio (1.33:1)". This is untrue. Virtually all sound films until 1953, including Cinderella, were 1.37:1. Since a TV screen is 1.33:1, you don't lose a lot when the original is "formatted to fit your television." I just wish they hadn't lied about it.

Cinderella ends at breakneck pace: we go straight from her foot sliding into the glass slipper to the wedding to Happily Ever After, bing, bang, boom. Walt Disney believed "Audiences like a happy ending, but they don't like a happy ending that goes on too long." Hey, who am I to argue? Well, maybe I'll argue. A DVD extra addresses scenes originally planned for the movie but not actually used. One of these would have occurred after the fitting of the glass slipper and before the wedding: Cinderella is taken by the Grand Duke to the castle in her normal everyday clothes; the first time Prince Charming sees her since the ball she's not wearing a lovely gown, she's wearing her scullery maid outfit. Cinderella is frightened, how will he react when he realizes she's not a fine lady but a poor servant girl? And of course he doesn't care how she's dressed, he loves her anyway. I can **see** that scene in my mind, it would have worked beautifully. This is the one way in which an almost perfect movie could have been even a tiny bit better

They just don't have movies like this anymore.  This is not a movie that makes Charlie Sheen or Tom Berenger appeal to the young audiences who like flashy stars on sceen.  This is amovie to show you the reality of war and experiences that happened to people in the past.  

Charlie Sheen stars as a man who volutarily goes to war.  This seems odd and he figures out why everyone was looking at him so weird when he was telling them this later in the movie.  He finds out alright.  Keith David plays his friend who tries to keep his spirits up and this is definitely his best role.  He cheers him up in a great scene where they get extremely baked.  The supporting cast in this movie is unbelievable and no flat performances here.  Overall this is my favorite movie of all time.  It has stood the test of time and never fails when I want to see a good movie.  

I just have the old special edition, not the 20th anniversary but the extras are very nice.  It has a commentary from the direcotor and a seperate one from the military advisor who worked on the film.  There is also a lengthy doumentary about the making of and when I saw this I was mroe than glad I got the special edition.  You would nto believe what the actors went through!  It is a great making of.

My kids (age 5, 7 and 10) love this movie.  I actually bought the VHS version many years ago when the movie first came out but wanted the DVD so we could watch it in the car when while traveling.  My husband and I originally bought this movie for my little nephew to watch so it's nice that we can share it with our own kids now.  If you love animals, this movie is for you.  The DVD jacket says this movie took a few years to make and I believe it.  It's absolutely amazing how the animals relate to each other.  This has got to be one of the best animal films out there.

Not a fan of graphic novels or CGI, I was fully prepared to dislike this movie, but found it to be so well written, cast and shot that I will no doubt buy it for my collection. It's a dark movie, subversive really, but carries a strong message that tyranny will not long survive the will of the people, that one strong person with a will, determination and the cleverness to use the tools of the corrupt against them, can turn the tide. It's a powerful message, and it's beautifully displayed with imaginative imagery, symbolism and script. Bravo

Based on the bestselling novels by Michael and Jeff Shaara, "Gods and Generals" and "Gettysburg" (based on the elder Shaara's "The Killer Angels") are the most excting and emotional Civil War epics ever filmed. The battle scenes are the most exciting and realistic Civil War battle sequences ever put on screen. The acting is phenomenal, with the likes of Jeff Daniels, Stephen Lang, Tom Berenger, Robert Duvall, Bruce Boxleitner, Martin Sheen, Richard Jordan, Sam Elliott and Mira Sorvino, but to name a few of the fine actors and actresses in these two movies. Director Ronald F. Maxwell has created a masterpiece with his first two films, giving rise to the hope that the last film, "The Last Full Measure," will complete what will hopefully be the best Civil War trilogy ever made!

Nothing beats this show.  Archie was recently rated the number 1 television character of all time by Bravo for a reason (Edith was number 12).  Highly recommend since the re-runs that are seen on various TV stations are chopped by about 2 1/2 minutes a piece

I really like this DVD - you can get some really good exercise in only 10 minutes.  Lara does not waste time on lengthy explanations between exercises, and she moves quickly from one exercise to another.  I like the variety of exercises - there are not too many rep's on any one exercise, which keeps the workout from being monotonous.  

This is the first "programmable" exercise DVD I've used, and I like being able to pick and choose which exercise segments to do and in which order - this makes it easier for me to get motivated to start (and once I start, I'm fine)

The movies of course are dated, but fascinating also.  The picture quality was excellent as was the sound.  The main iterest was in seing how much movie stories have changed.  Now even the simplest movie, regardless of the subject has an edge.  These "horror" movies of the 40s-50s are gentler, less scary, with a clear statement of good and evil. Now we view things differently without any absolute judgments. Clarity has given way to a more unsettled world

I am a faithful CSI watcher, and have been since the shows inception.
I buy the DVD sets and enjoy them tremendously.  However, there are
two trends I see developing that I don't care for---one, there is
too much Catherine.  We know everything about her kid, her dead
husband, her crook father, etc., and she's really an annoying character.  
She makes nasty comments about everyone; she's always being insubordinate;
she goes out with men half her age (let's quit trying to make
her seem like a young chick when she isn't, especially wearing those
skin tight jeans), she is very arrogant, and even though she continually
screws up (loses her camera; blows up the lab in a previous season,
accuses people before she has all the evidence), they made her a
supervisor.  Also, the plot line with Grissom and Sara, while 
predictable, is not the greatest.  I think Grissom would be 
better off paired with Lady Heather.  There's an idea!  Let's see more
of Lady Heather.  Still, even with the annoying overabundance of the 
least likable character (Catherine), the show is one of the best, if not 
THE best, on TV (up there with Without a Trace, NCIS and Numbers).  Keep 'em coming

The Freshman is a very funny movie.  The central joke is that Marlon Brando plays a godfather type figure in lower Manhattan who for obvious reasons looks exactly like the titular character Brando so famously portrayed.    Matthew Broderick is the freshman, an innocent NYU film student, who through some comedic misadventures gets involved with Brando and his "family".  The funniest scenes involve a  Komodo dragon  loose in a New Jersey shopping mall though the whole film is a delightful comedy.  The movie has no real violence  and though there are a few mild "bad" words the movie is fairly appropriate for viewing by older kids and families.

"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets", the second Harry Potter film in the series, was the first bit of the Harry Potter phenomenon I was every exposed to. I'd kind of avoided the boy wizard before then, but after seeing it those couple of years ago, even though I didn't entirely follow what was what and who was who, I realized it was pretty entertaining. After reading the second book recently, I picked up the DVD and watched it again. The series gets a little darker, like the books do, but unlike the book, I don't think the jump is as large, which I reckon is a good thing. Though I prefer the first film, it's still good to watch.

It's Harry's (Daniel Radcliffe's) second year at Hogwart's wizards school, and after a shaky summer, he returns to find himself in the midst of a sinister plot. It seems a certain Heir of Slytherin has opened the legendary Chamber of Secrets, loosing a monster that is wandering about petrifing students, literally! Many fingers point to Harry, Harry's finger points to Malfoy, and Ron's wand... well that doesn't point at all, as its broken and backfiring. What's this all got to do with the mysterious trails spiders, haunted toilets, a rogue Quidditch bludger and a self-flagellating house elf? Can Harry, Ron and Hermione figure things out?

All the kids are a little bit older and a little bit wiser in this film, plus the boys' voices are breaking. In some scenes they're kind of croaky sounding, in other scenes they have their child voice, and in others their voices broken through, not neccesarily in that order. There's a couple of new kids, (like Colin Creevey) and they are just as well cast as the others. The new adults are well cast too. Though not my favorite performance of his career, Shakespearean actor Kenneth Branagh makes an interesting Gilderoy Lockhart, the vain second year dark arts teacher. He played it a lot more subtley than I expected him to. Ex-Fast Show comedian Mark Williams plays Mr Weasley, which I reckon was a great choice. I missed some of the cast from the last film though. You hardly see Warwick Davis (who plays Professor Flitwick), let alone hear him say anything, and John Cleese's Nearly Headless Nick, who has a rather significant deathday party in the book, has hardly anything to do here except get petrified.

There were other things cut out too, like the catching of the garden gnomes at the Weasley's. The fans of the book will feel the absence more than the casual viewers though. Personally, I like to think of the Harry Potter films as illustrations to the books put into motion, rather like the pictures in the world of Hogwarts. They give an idea of what the book would look like, an impression.

Special features include an interview with author J.K. Rowling and script writer Steve Kloves, as well as interviews with all the kids and all the main adult actors. There's also slick virtual tours through Diagon Alley, Dumbledore's Office and Gilderoy Lockhart's Classroom (a tour that turns out to be just as pretentious as he is, complete with gushing praises from the narrator). There's also a couple of games: you can visit the Chamber of Secrets after answering some Harry Potter trivia, you can drive the flying car through the forbidden forest (which I found frustrating but addictive). There's also a trivia game about what spell does what too. Unlike the first DVD, you don't have to beat any games to access the deleted scenes, you're able to go to them straight from the main menu. Just as well, there's 19 of them, and some of them are pretty significant. Notable scenes include Harry's close encounter with the Malfoys in the dark magic shop, Harry discovering that Filch is taking wizard lessons by correspondence. I wish they'd left some of these scenes in, particularly the ones where Harry Potter questions his nature, is he a good wizard or a bad wizard. That was some mighty fine character development cut there! There's also a gallery of design drawings and a section called "Colin Creevey's Darkroom" where you can select pictures of various characters, then play them in a slideshow of sorts.

Apparently there's a whole stack of stuff in the DVD ROM features, but I just couldn't get them to work on my laptop's DVD drive. Using InterActual player (the player that many Warner Brothers films have you install to play their DVDs), it says there is a script error, and when I tried Windows Media Player 9 and Cyberlink PowerDVD 4.0, though it ran the DVD and everything else with it fine, the DVD acted as if it wasn't in a DVD ROM drive, telling me that if I put the DVD into my PC's drive I'd get all these wonderful features. It was in my DVD drive! Aggh! It IS in a DVD drive. Maybe its just my type of laptop (BenQ DH5100U, 1.5 Gigahertz). Ah well, it looked like it would have been really fun, especially for fans of the series.

All in all, its definitely worth a look for Harry Potter fans, but I would recommend you read the book first

Watching this movie is a very bizarre experience.  Having attended high school in the countryside, close to large clusters of Amish farms, I had heard stories from my friends at school about rumspringing Amish teenagers.  I dismissed most of them as rumor.  This movie confirmed that those wild stories I heard were probably true.  A very intruiging look at the flipside of a lifestyle most Americans cannot even begin to comprehend.  Worth a rental at the very least

Bob Clark's 1974 chiller classic, which went on to inspire many elements of "Halloween" and "When a Stranger Calls", is definitely one of the better, if not best, horror films out there. Period. Not high on blood, but very high on suspense, dread, atmosphere, and out-of-the-dark surprises. A sorority house (to include the lovely Olivia Hussey, the vulgar alcoholic Margot Kidder, and SCTV vet Andrea Martin) falls victim to vicious, violent, and altogether menacing phone calls during the Christmas holidays. Soon, students on campus begin turning up missing. Though some events do go unexplained (which could be positive, considering the mystery involved) and the film tends to go borderline predictable in some sorts, this is undeniably one of the creepiest horror films, with the most tense, moody photography ever captured on film. Keir Dullea and Margot Kidder turn in quite effective performances. Highly recommended

My six year old (who has NEVER been very excited about exercise) really loves this DVD. The routine is active, fun and most importantly easy to learn.  Other videos have simply left her frustrated when the routine was complicated or very little instruction was offered. She completed the workout the first day and when she woke up the next morning, she asked to do it again! My 2 1/2 year old has a great time "dancing" with us as well

House 1 is darker than it's sequels but stll maintains the horror/comedy feel throughout.  

Don't expect to be blown away by outlandish Hollywood special effects. The majority of the special effects are not special.  But if you can get over that, you'll enjoy the movie.

DVD is pretty bare bones with no amazing special features. I doubt much of that was available due to the age of the film. I'm just happy it was released on DVD!

If you are a fan of low budget horror/comedy movies this movie may appeal to you. It's no Evil Dead, but it is an entertaining movie.

This DVD contains all of the original Ben Stiller Show episodes, plus an extra un-aired episode. The show was not only far ahead of its time, but also timeless as is evidenced by Stiller's subsequent successful movie roles that drew from many of the characters from the TV series. For anyone who was a fan of the TV series or Stiller's movies, this DVD is a must

This movie is asome its one of my favorites from the 90's and probably my favorite plot twister/ who done it along with M night shamylans films. this movies great plot is over looked by the average americans craving desire of sex and scandal which is retarded and makes this country alittle less than great. anyway the shear sex appeal is also one of the tones that makes this movies atomasphere so great the music hits it perfect and the 2 leads are my favorite younger actress' neve campbell and Denise richards who are both perfect for they're rolls. The whole movie is just oozing with sex appeal that combined with the story makes it irresistable. which is unexpected from john Mcnaughton as it was his first big claim to fame film. bill murray adds some much needed comic releif and the plot will keep you guessing till the end and will fool anyone even those retards from CSI. The 2 girls have "it" in theyre rolls they just seem to fit together like a sexy peanut butter and jelly sandwhich. I was fist drawn to this film ever since i meet Matt Dillon at universal studios he was just asome and i had to see him act, and everyone recommended this movie for that and he was asome in it to. infact i wouldnt mind meeting the whole cast all of them are huge idols of mine and theyre all so cool. i do miss neve campbell.. i wish she'd come back to films and it looks like she will. so if your looking for a once in a lifetime plot and an asome cast this movie has it or if your like the 99.9% of people who have seen this and you only like it for the threesome and the pool scenes then i guess its good for that to since ive only seen the editied verison. Ps dont waste ur time with the other sequals theyre stupid and repeats of this one with not so famous casts. take a look at the fist still at the bottom it sums up the whole "it" thing i was taking about you just feel an incredible amount of "cool" form that shoot, well i did anyway

"The Incredibles", together with "Finding Nemo", "Shrek 1 & 2", "Madagascar" and the "Spy Kids" series, certainly mark a turning point in terms of animated moviemaking. Particularly The Incredibles is a movie no kid (or adult as well) will ever get tired of watching. As for the plot... it is just plainly great. Things have been kind of boring for superheroes since they have been forced to give up their superpowers and adopt a conventional lifestyle. But everything will change for Mr. Incredible and his family when an interesting business proposal will ultimately make him wear his superhero suit again for an exciting new job.
My kids just love this movie (and so do I!

Great movie!

Delivery of the order came in good time.

This 2-Disc Collector's Edition comes with some interesting extras.  
I found the offtakes/blubbers to be in bad taste, but the rest of the extras were worth seeing.

Personnally I would avoid watching the extras that describe the making of the movie.  Although it is interesting to watch, especially for those wanting to go into the movie making business, I find that it then takes away from the enjoyment of watching the movie itself.  Just my personal preference.  No doubt others will have different opinions

Until Sam Raimi made Spider-Man, I think we all regarded Tim Burton's Batman as the best superhero movie (even though I actually don't consider Batman to be a "superhero" because he has no superpowers). Burton directed this movie, and did a great job - this movie looks like it takes place in the 1920s, except that society is a lot more technologically advanced than it really was back then. 

Michael Keaton is Batman/Bruce Wayne. Needless to say, Batman is Wayne's alter ego. Keaton is magnificent at playing the character's alter ego. Keaton also does a good job playing the character when he's not in costume. Keaton's Bruce Wayne isn't as gloomy as Christian Bale's was in Batman Begins, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. But I would say Bruce Wayne was a little too cheerful for my liking in the Schumacher movies. But overall, Bale's Bruce Wayne is superior to Keaton's because Bale has a much more developed character to play. HOWEVER, Keaton plays a better costumed Batman than Bale.

The problem with this movie is that the Joker (Jack Nicholson) steals the show - the whole movie revolves around him, so this isn't Batman's movie. This movie should have been called "The Joker." So if you ever wondered why Nicholson got a higher billing than Keaton, now you know. The thing is, the writers never bothered to give Bruce Wayne a personality, and they barely scratch the surface of the character's background - we know practically nothing about Wayne. You'd think the guy that's Batman wouldn't be so uninteresting, but we're bored to tears everytime Wayne's onscreen (and out of costume). But when Keaton is onscreen in the Batman costume, Batman seems so menacing and captivating that you enjoy all of his scenes. He plays an even more menacing Batman than Bale - so I say that Keaton does a better Batman than Bale, but that Bale does a better Bruce Wayne than Keaton. But Keaton didn't have anything to work with, so it's not his fault his Bruce Wayne is so weak. But one of the strengths of Keaton's performance is that if you ever met Wayne, he'd seem like the last guy in the World that could be Batman. That's something Kilmer and Clooney failed to accomplish, but thankfully Bale was able to do it.

Michael Gough is a delight as the old butler Alfred. It's hard to believe Gough was a villain in so many horror movies over the years. I assumed Michael Caine's Alfred wouldn't compare to Gough's, but I was wrong - they're both great. Pat Hingle was really good (as Commissioner Gordon) in this movie. Hingle and Gough were in all four movies of the original series, and I enjoyed them both in Batman Returns. But in Batman Forever I didn't like them nearly as much, and in Batman & Robin I found their characters annoying as hell.

Vicki Vale's (Kim Basinger) investigation into Bruce Wayne's background is completely uninteresting. But I already knew what she would find out, so maybe that's why I didn't like those scenes. I also found the Vicki character annoying, screaming in terror every three seconds she was onscreen. 

There's lots of little things I love in this movie. The sight of Batman rising off the ground after the two muggers shoot him, (and the terrified expression of the gunmen) with Elfman's dramatic music blaring. The look on Napier's face when he sees the emptied safe. When the guy got fried by the Joker's joy-buzzer (one of the worst deaths I've ever seen in a movie). When the mimes close in on the press conference and unleash a surprise, and the Joker's speech right before a mob boss dies. The first Action News report of the movie. The way "URGENT" is written in messy crayon on the parcel. When Batman jumps through the skylight (accompanied by Elfman's music). The design of the Batmobile - minor changes make the car even cooler in Batman Returns. When the Batmobile speeds toward the Batcave (again, Elfman's music is awesome). The grin on the young Jack Napier. The Batmobile attacking the chemical factory. The Joker's facial expressions when he speaks in the microphone right after throwing lots of money to the crowd. When the bat signal is lit - but it's not as awesome as the first time it's lit in Batman Returns, or when it's lit at the end of Mask of the Phantasm.

And now a few complaints. This movie featured too many songs by Prince. After a while, they get unbearably annoying. There were lots of other great `80s pop songs that could have (and should have) been used in this movie. Another thing is the Joker seems completely helpless without his goons to back him up. So I found the final showdown at the bell tower a little boring. By the way, you can tell that Nicholson's make-up job would look a lot more realistic in this day and age of filmmaking. Burton's Batwing is cooler than Schumacher's Batwing (but not as cool as the one in Mask of the Phantasm). Anyway, the targeting system of Burton's Batwing seems a little screwed up - Batman has a big red target locked on the Joker, but the plane's missiles and machine guns miss their target. And the Joker didn't even try to get out of the way! Looks like Batman paid the price of designing his own weapon systems.

I always overlooked this movie's flaws (until I saw Batman Begins) for two reasons. First of all, I found Keaton's Batman to be so cool and the Joker to be so entertaining that I ABSOLUTELY LOVED this movie. Second of all, the poor quality of the sequels make this movie seem a lot better than it really is. Pretty much everytime the Joker or the Batman aren't onscreen, the movie is boring. But I must say that Batman was even cooler in Batman Returns than he was in this movie - and nastier.

Sometimes I wonder how it is we don't live in a vigilante society.  People do such awful things and alot of times the system really can't/don't do anything for the victims.  Well, in this film, this family was not going to just sit there and let the system dictate how their son's killer would be dealt with.  

Story takes place in a small town where the Strout family is a big deal.  You know the family that everyone in the community knows and basically the money makers.  There is also the Fowler family which also make their way in the town.  She is a folk song teacher and the father is a doctor and they have 1 college age son, Frank, that is dating an older woman (Marisa Tomei) and she has 2 sons.  Well, the Strout family's son is married to Marisa Tomei and is not dealing well with the fact that she is dating the college boy and they aren't even divorced yet.  Can't say that I blame him there, but it is inherent that he is a real prick and probably treated her and their sons poorly.  

Moving along, the Strout's son kills Frank and because of the Strout's clout and the fact that the ex wife didn't actually see him fire the shot, he is going to get off with manslaughter.  This does not sit well with the Fowler's.  The Fowler's have a friend that has over 300 acres of land, so you can only imagine what happens.  I certainly don't condone vigilantism, however, I just loved the ending.  The Strout family put up property and funds to cover his bail, so since it appeared that he jumped bail, they will lose all of that.  Beautiful!  Then, they were able to get some pleasure from the fact that they will never have to see that jerk again roaming the streets.  I couldn't help but get some satisfaction out of that myself.  Very real and very interesting.  Great movie

Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker deliver once again in this follow-up to their great film "Rush Hour". This film follows on the premise of the first, with a bit of a reversal....this time Tucker is the fish out of water in Chan's Hong Kong.

As with my review of Rush Hour, I'll say up front that if youre looking for anything more than a fun-filled actioner, then this movie wont please you. It breaks no new ground and the plot is quite formulaic, but if you're looking for deep drama and character development...what are you doing watching a Chris Tucker movie?

Watch for a great cameo by Don Cheadle as a black man married to an asian woman who owns and runs a Chinese Soul Food restaurant in a black section of Los Angeles. That alone is worth a laugh. There is another stand-out cameo by Jeremy Piven as a gay clothing store clerk who mistakes them for a couple. Be sure to watch the end credits and catch all of Piven's ad-libbed outtakes that ended up on the cutting room floor. But then, as with all Jackie Chan films, half the fun is watching the flubs during the end credits

"When was the last time you actually bought a ticket to see a movie, you actually paid your own money to see it?"
"Last night, Pasedena. The Bicycle Thief."
"It's an art movie. It doesn't count. We're talking about movie movies."

Robert Altman is one of my favorite directors, mainly for the way he finds insight in the most inane actions or phrases. This short exchange has many layers when taken out of context and many more when taken in context. With this dialog, The Player reveals exactly why Hollywood movies don't make the money they should. Not because they don't make quality films, but because when a good movie does make money, it doesn't count because it's not a "movie movie." If he stopped to really listen to what was being said, he would've seen that art films have a great drawing power and actually don't cost much to make. But people still wonder why the modern film industry is suffering.

Wait, there's more. The people in the room don't know it, but producer Griffin Mill, in a fit of paranoia, killed an unemployed screenwriter outside the theater that night. He was being stalked by a writer, but he blamed (and murdered) the wrong one. Now he's still being stalked, still in danger of losing his job, and the cops suspect him of murder. Not a good week for Mister Mill.

As the conversation presses on, Mill's potential replacement passes around a newspaper, telling people to read random headlines to be made into scripts. Mill spots the story on his murder which we're already watching play out in a movie.

Yes, it's that type of movie, the self-referential Hollywood movie about Hollywood movies that keeps teasing itself for the viewers' enjoyment. We've seen it about a thousand times before (or since): Get Shorty, Adaptation, Wes Craven's New Nightmare, even certain elements of 8 1/2. There's really nothing too special about it, but this one has much more subtlety and is much more believable. Pay close attention to the ending scene, and think about what words they're using opposed to what they're really saying.

There's really only one word for a film like this: "Clever!

The beautiful young Brooke Shields plays 11/12 year old Violet, daughter of Hattie (Susan Sarandon) a New Orleans prostitute living and working in a brothel in 1917. Violet has been raised in the brothel and has not been to school and has known no other life or anything about the outside world. When she turns 12, her virginity is auctioned off. Brooke Shields' portrayal of Violet is poignant and beautiful. Her childish charms and innocence are so heart-wrenchingly sweet. The scene where she jumps up and down on the photographer's bed (very childlike) and asks him whether he will take care of her before throwing her arms around him and giving him small childlike kisses on the nose, forehead etc. and reciting that little rhyme really pulled at my heart strings! I just wanted to jump into the TV and give her a hug!! This, mixed with the seductive adult things that she also says in this scene (and others) is particularly poignant as we know that young Violet is merely reciting what she's heard from the prostitutes. The photographer also says that Violet doesn't know what she's saying. You just want to turn the clock back, hug Violet and give her a proper childhood! The photographer marries her because he's fascinated with her beauty, innocence and is concerned that she is only a child and should not be in a brothel becoming a prostitute. The part where he gives her a doll is poignant as she has already lost her virginity and it seems that he's trying to give back her childhood, sadly she's been exposed to too much, too soon in her life. Susan Sarandon and Brooke Shields are wonderful in this movie as well as Keith Carradine, the photographer. The art aspect & music soundtrack are amazing. This movie deals with a taboo subject seen through the eyes of a child as 'normal' which enhances poignancy and brings out the viewers maternal need to 'rescue' young Violet.

A very enjoyable documentary from the personal perspective of an ex Christian.We need many such documentaries out there to help inform people about the dangers of religion in general. I wish some brave person would do a film about how Christianity came into being from an objective historical perspective. This film touched on the subject, but it was not really the focus of the documentary.Perhaps we will be "blessed" by a further exploration of the subject in the future

This is a highly entertaining film with an incredibly minimalist screenplay that succeeds beyond all expectations. This film's strengths are its characters and the actors that portray them. Sean Connery plays Captain Marko Ramius with great bravado and charisma relying greatly on his mesmerizing screen presence to maneuver the entire direction of this film. Tim Curry is amusing as the dutiful Dr. Petrov in a role well suited for him. The rest of the cast balances out the histrionics of Sean Connery and Tim Curry with realistic and convincing performances to bring authenticity and realism to the drama of this film. Alec Baldwin as Jack Ryan, James Earl Jones as Admiral James Greer, Sam Neill as Captain Vasily Borodin, Scott Glenn as Commander Bart Mancuso, Richard Jordan as Dr. Jeffrey Pelt and an impressive Peter Firth as Political Officer Ivan Putin bring a needed sense of pragmatism to their collective roles to bolster the dramatics and emotion of the story. This was probably one of Alec Baldwin's best performances and he truly conducts himself in the manner that the character of Jack Ryan should have been portrayed. Baldwin perfectly conveyed the analytical mind that the character of Jack Ryan embodied. Sam Neill is also brilliant as the dedicated officer who also possesses a very human side that perhaps puts him in conflict with carrying out his duties to the full extent of his country's political dictates and ambitions. Sam Neill has a wonderful role in this regard and he plays it flawlessly. I liked Scott Glenn's character immensely as the US Commander who truly has to rely on his instincts and his logical interpretation of facts and events to face what is put before him. The list of performances goes on but the point is that portrayal of these characters and how they think and conduct themselves is at the heart of this film. Their efforts make this film a great political, action-adventure and emotional drama.

This was a subject of much conversation when I was deployed to Saudi Arabia and it's still a favorite with most military and Civilians in Iraq. "Ground Hog Day" is a term used to describe the seemingly endless days that are all the same...until finally,the day comes when the alarm goes off and you wake up realizing it's the day you leave. The movie is high in entertainment value and the story is unusual and unique; Bill Murray was the perfect choice to cast in the lead roll and the supporting cast all played their parts just as well. It's fun watching the lead character develop and become a new man, and it almost makes me wish we had a piano here.

Leather Wing would only buy this if he ran out of toilet paper, because, you know, a dvd makes good toilet paper (maybe it's why he's so grumpy).
I would suggest purchasing it and watching it.  Michael Moore may be more to the left than some, but god, hasn't anyone ever considered watching everything with a speculative eye?  It's less biased than the news is - he reports, you decide, and most of it is things that should have been covered by the news in some fashion, but weren't.
Michael Moore is far more honest than the Republican talking heads (Rush, Coulter, Hannity).  Watch, enjoy, investigate further

If you follow my reviews, you know that I felt the version of "Jack the Ripper" with Michael Caine as Inspector Fred Abberline was a phenomenal masterpiece. Not only was Michael Caine phenomenal in the role, but that version offered convincing speculation to a mystery we don't know and never will. While I respect this version with Johnny Depp, it is more horror oriented. (Michael Caine's version was more historical.) Onto the subject at hand. Some of you may know Jack's 5 victims. (Mary Anne Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, Kathy Eadows, and Mary Jane Kelly.) Well, they seem to have a close friendship, and we also get the impression that they share some dangerous secret. (In the Michael Caine version, the 5 victims knew each other, but they were just associates.) Well, of course Jack the Ripper comes into play. One scene is very well done in that while we don't see his face, we do see some disturbing pictures, and we do see him cutting his steak and pouring blood red wine. In comes Depp (Inspector Fred Abberline). It is interesting that while the older Michael Caine brought frustration and tremendous energy to the role, Johnny Depp looks like his character is living on borrowed time and going to die anyday. But maybe Depp didn't want to just imitate Caine. One thing I had a problem with was that while Caine had some trouble with his superiors, Depp's trouble with his superiors is blown out of proportion. (Without giving the story away, his superiors must have known things that they didn't tell Depp! At least Caine's superiors carried some reason on their side!) You'll probably notice that Depp finds things out much quicker than Caine did. (Probably because Caine's version was 4 hours, while Depp's is only 2.) While Caine was involved with an artist, Depp becomes involved with Mary Jane Kelly. Gradually, Depp discovers things that put together an interesting puzzle. Like Caine did in his version, Depp ironically gets close and almost friendly with the killer. (OF COURSE, DEPP DOES NOT KNOW HE IS TALKING TO THE KILLER.) Well, another problem here is that in the Caine version, we can understand more why the killer appeared normal and was even friendly with Caine. We never really understand here why the killer is friendly and even helpful to Depp. (Jack the Ripper does not have the same mental illness he did in the Caine version.) I will admit that the scenery is well done, the elements of horror are there, and Depp did a good job of not just imitating Michael Caine. And Depp's sergeant Godley does offer some entertainment. But if you saw the Michael Caine version, you will undoubtedly miss the quite probable historical accuracy. If on the other hand, you don't mind the fact that this version is more geared towards horror than history, you'll probably find it a respectable horror movie. SIDE NOTE: Johnny Depp makes Inspector Fred Abberline look like he's going to die anyday. Well, in reality, Fred Abberline lived on for 40 more years after he stopped Jack the Ripper.

There are plenty of anti-Bush films and books around. If you only shall see or read one, this must be the best pick. I like Michael Moore very much, but he is not really a political heavyweighter. And i don't think Fahrenheit 9/11 is his best work, it does not mix humour and political insight as well as   the book "stupid white men" for instance. It is more like two or three movies in one. 
William Karel IS a political heavyweighter and he does not try to make anything more than a documentary. But what a documentary it has turned out to be. Very disturbing insights from informed sources, among them former CIA-agents. It is not usual to hear such plain speaking from "people in high places" just a few years after the events. This film is perhaps not as entertaining as Fahrenheit 9/11, but far more informative.

  From a serious U2 fan's perspective, the best thing about this dvd is simply the selection of songs.  The bonus material is cool, the sound quality's great, the visuals are always impressive, but it's the SONGS that are the real attraction.  As it should be.

  Two scorching rockers from their criminally ignored debut album BOY, four in a row from the all-time masterpiece ACHTUNG BABY, and nearly everything from their Grammy-sweeping triumph HOW TO DISMANTLE AN ATOMIC BOMB.  I also love that they chose to not play anything from their string of disappointing nineties albums.  Good call! Also, Many familiar songs are given exciting new treatments, such as Running To Stand Still (a perfect hybrid of the Joshua Tree and Zoo TV versions), Elevation (longer, better build-up), Bullet The Blue Sky (check out Edge's extended blues jam in the final minutes), and Original of the Species (acoustic piano ballad).

  This was the first major U2 tour in which they routinely and substantially altered the set list.  For instance, when I saw them they played Miss Sarajevo, Stuck In A Moment, Gloria, I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For, Instant Karma, Until The End Of The World, and others not represented here.  Here's hoping they release at least one more Vertigo Tour DVD...

I had never watched this film before ordering it, so I took the chance.  It turned out to be a smart buy!  As usual, Peck is just awesome.  He seems to fit this role well, as if it captures a true part of his persona as a family man.  As the movie continues you  realize that you can relate to the character on a personal level.  I enojoyed the flashback sequences and thought they were placed well throughout the film.  Overall, this movie supplies drama and action for the viewer.  So, if you are considering purchasing this dvd, I'd suggest you buy it.  You'll enjoy it

China: The Panda Adventure is an IMAX film that tells a story..

So..in a sense the Pandas are a part of this story but not in the sense of a documentary.  The story is set in 1936 and is based on a true story involving Ruth Harkness who has arrived in China to take care of the business affairs of her late husband.  Her husband, it seems was a great admirer of the Giant Panda and in his journal he writes a beautiful story about his experiences with them..This leads Ruth to seek these Pandas out to see for herself..As the story unfolds we see the beauty and majesty of China..The cinematography is outstanding and the music fits the film quite well..

Ruth is played by the lovely Maria Bello and there is an additional documentary about the making of this film is which she talks about her reasons for wanting to do this film and her fascination with the Panda..

All in all..this film is a nice way to spend the evening with your family..but be warned..it's more of a story involving the Panda and not a documentary.

  This reveals a great deal about Vietnam and the 1960's.
Should be prized by students of Kennedy, Johnson, and our military history in the nuclear age

Well, it was good.  I enjoyed it, but it was not the best plot and the characters had 2-D personalitys.. The worst thing, though, was how abruptly it ended. Other than that it had that great Japanese animation, and it was pretty fun to watch

I was stunned by this movie. I learned of it and purchased it in 2003. For various reasons it remains for me the best, most emotional movie I have seen about musicians and their music. The producer chose well: He found the songwriters that shaped country and rock for the next 30 years: Townes Van Zandt, Rodney Crowell, Steve Earle, Guy Clark, Steve Young, John Hiatt, Charlie Daniels and a tribute to the late Skinny Dennis, immortalized in Guy Clark's "LA Freeway." I wish David Allen Coe had been left out, but no film is perfect. 
The songwriters are shown at their best and worst:  a drunken,  funny TVZ falls into a rabbit hole and Silent Night is rendered by fine musicians too drunk to remember the lyrics.  

This movie was made when I was a poor student and musician with a small circle of talented friends in Tampa at the University of South Florida. The difference is that most of my friends and I got straight jobs [we still tried to make a difference] but these musicians changed the world, just a little. 
I married the singer/Business major I met at USF and divorced 30 years later. I still play guitar, write and record at home and dream of making it in music - but mostly I learn songs written by artists like those in this movie and try to understand the magic they have that still captures me. 
When TVZ sang 'Waiting around to die' he brought tears to the eyes of his 70+ blacksmith neighbor, while Cindy comforts him. It was magical. TVZ does a "medley of my hit" and sings "Pancho and Lefty," and Rodney Crowell sang "Bluebird Wine," both covered by Emmylou. Steve Young's "Alabama Highways" was wonderful too. It was a look into my past -  and the past and future of the intelligent, emotional music I love best.

I guess I understand why this movie was so savagely criticized during it's year of release, 1986.  Prince was still enjoying huge popularity based largely on the success of "Purple Rain," both the film and the soundtrack.  And critics love to knock someone off a pedestal, which is what they did to Prince in those days.  Many claimed that the movie was nothing more than an ego trip.  They couldn't believe Prince had the nerve to fire the director and then assume that role himself.  It was all way too harsh criticism for a movie that isn't trying to be anything more than a fun romantic comedy. 

Of course, poor critical response alone doesn't usually keep the public from making a movie popular.  Yet "Under the Cherry Moon" was a bomb at he box office.  Probably the main reason for this is that the movie, although shot in color, was released in black-and-white.  For some unfathomable reason, the general movie-going public is more often than not horrified at the prospect of seeing a black-and-white movie.  Now don't get me wrong, I'm not claiming that had the movie been released in color that people would have flocked to it in droves.  I'm only saying that it would have attracted more of an audience if it had been in color.  I will acknowledge that this movie's target audience is Prince fans.  Since I am one myself, and have been most of my life, I'm not the most entirely objective viewer.

But I make no apologies for my love of this movie.  It's not a "guilty pleasure" for me, because I proudly hold this as one of my favorites.  I had only seen it a couple times before the DVD release - and unfotunately I missed it in theaters (I couldn't get anyone to take me, I was only 12 and none of my friends were into P and certainly not my parents - though my dad went with me a few years later to see "Grafitti Bridge" on opening night, but that's for another review).  But since it's DVD release in 2004, this has become one of my most-watched discs in my collection.

The soundtrack is KILLER, the tunes make up one of the best Prince albums ever.  There's even some great stuff heard in the movie that didn't make the album (some of which was issued on 12" vinyl).  Plus, I think the movie looks great - the cinematographer was Michael Ballhaus, who has multiple Academy Award nominations to his credit (and was the DP on numerous Martin Scorsese classics).  I wonder how the movie would feel in color, but I do think black-and-white was the right way to go.  Even though the movie is set in then-contemporary times, it has the feel of something from the '30s.  

There are so many classic moments in this movie, I won't try to list them all.  But here are a few... Christopher Tracy (Prince) giving his "Bela Lugosi eyes"...Tricky (Jerome Benton) tossing rose petals into the tub while Christopher takes a bath...Christopher freaking out when he sees bats at the eatery...the "Wreka Stow" scene...the car race between Christopher and Mary Sharon (Kristen Scott Thomas).

As for the acting, I've heard a lot of people saying that Prince's performance was no good.  I don't see much truth in that claim.  After being so serious in "Purple Rain," it was a nice contrast to see him so loose and funny in this.  Jerome Benton proved he could do just fine even without Morris Day at his side (as in "Purple Rain") - I'm surprised Jerome hasn't done much additional acting outside of Prince movies.  And obviously Kristen Scott Thomas moved on from this, her first major role, to become an Oscar-nominated, highly repected leading lady.  

How is the DVD presentation?  Pretty good, for such a largely overlooked movie.  The widescreen transfer and 2.0 stereo mix aren't anything phenomenal, but get the job done nonetheless; the movie looks and sounds fine.  As for features, anyone expecting a full-blown Special Edition like the 2-disc "Purple Rain" will be disappointed.  But at least it's not a completely bare-bones release - four music videos are included, though unfortunately not presented in optimal audio/visual quality (though they are passable, I would've preferred 5.1 mixes).  The highlight is the live performance of "anotherlover" which was taken from a never-released (at least not domestically, not sure if it saw the light of day anywhere outside the U.S.) concert video documenting the Parade tour.  

MTV held an interesting (i.e.- very weird) contest to determine where "Under the Cherry Moon" would have it's world premiere.  The ten-thousandth caller to an MTV hotline would accompany Prince to the premiere, which would be held in their hometown.  MTV ran a special that covered the premiere party - and unlike the premiere of "Purple Rain" unfortunately this program is not to be found on "Under the Cherry Moon"'s DVD release.  Lisa Barber was the contest winner, and the movie did indeed premiere in her hometown of Sheridan, Wyoming - a very unusual place for a big movie to premiere.  When asked what he thought of the town of Sheridan, Prince summed it up with a single word: "Purple."

It took me all of 4 hours to read this book.  It was insightful and entertaining.  It was also sad.  I cried so hard at the end of the book that I hiccuped for 3 hours.  I work at a children's home and have passed this book to several of my 'children' who returned the book damp with tears and facing challenges with new resolve.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who has to face ANY TYPE of challenge, whether mental, physical, financial, whatever

...if the writers intended to have a reset-style ending all along, or if they were forced to compress and compromise their original vision.  

Would be very interested to hear about the "original" ending envisioned (and I don't mean that of ep 26) by the writers...

Nonetheless, after viewing the rest of WR, one can't avoid watching these last 4 eps..

This DVD is amazing!  Perfectly puts the Blues on display through the high-points and the low points of the season.  The best thing about this dvd, besides the flying, is the respect they show the crew.  Yeah, the pilots get the glory and do the high flying cool stuff, but, they are FAAAAR from the stars of the show!  The maintainers and support people behind the flying is where the stars hide.  This dvd also shines the light on the pilots and what they do.  They truly go through the mill, but, they don't do a single thing with those Blue jets if the crew does not do their job perfectly.  This is FINALLY a dvd that shines the light on the pilots, BUT, makes it clear that nothing happens without the crew in support of the pilots.  Great Job!!!
    Unlike the retired one who reviewed also (great review by the way!!!!), I would not like to be a pilot after seeing this!  I would rather get FAAAR more reward working in my support role and knowing that the pilot gets his glory only because my ability to do the work allows it

 The direction was A grade acting top class and to top it you had Eric and Clint eastwood .Eric fleming was mindblowing .One has yet to come across  an actor with his confidence class and authority .Yes I agree we always tend to focus on Clint forgetting that it was Eric who was mile ahead of him.Todays generation has to watch these episodes in black and white to understand the beauty of this great western.Yes the fact is without Rawhide there would be no Clint Eastwood

Joe Versus The Volcano is a rare blend of comedy and insight that's romantic enough for girls, funny enough for guys, with effective visual symbolism, and appropriate for the whole family.  Maybe it could be described as an allegory for escaping the drudgery of life, or something like that, but at any rate it's pleasant to watch, at times profound, at other times funny. 

The beginning 3rd is about Joe (Tom Hanks) struggling with hypochondria and a lousy, really crummy job, primarily because of the dreary work environment and the typical (oppressive) supervisor (Dan Hedaya). (I've been there myself, when I worked at Pines Mfg H&H Tooling and again at Toro, where everyone was on dope.)  Joe learns from his doctor (Robert Stack, of The Untouchables) that he has a "brain cloud" and only a few months to live.  The tone of the movie rises as Joe quits his job and we feel like impending death is the best thing that's ever happened to him. He takes a former co-worker (Meg Ryan) to dinner and seems to wake up to life for the first time.  

The next day billionaire Lloyd Bridges (Airplane) enters Joe's life with a bizarre proposition:  Since he's dying anyway, why not literally jump into a volcano - for the billionaire's own financial motive - and live it up with unlimited credit at the his expense in the meantime.  Joe accepts and in his journey to the volcanic island learns about how to live life from helpful chauffeur Ossie Davis (The Client) and the billionaire's two daughters - both played by Meg Ryan (Sleepless in Seattle), which makes a total of 3 roles for her in this great movie, making it even more pleasant to watch

This movie is 24 hours of kids being amoral creatures doing whatever strikes their fancy at the moment. Sex, drugs, beating on people, stealing, whatever keeps boredom at bay. There is no script to speak of, just watching them being themselves. One kid called Telly (about 15 or 16) who has AIDS (and may not know it) likes young virgins (12 to 14 year old girls). He's a predator with no conscience at all. Probably a sociopath. And his buddy Casper is a dumb punk who swills beer. He's just as bad as Telly. 

I have no doubt that teens like this exist. They existed back in the '70s when I was a teen. I'm sure most of the viewers of this disturbing movie don't have children. Perhaps parents need to view this to see what unsupervised teens are doing. I'm sure kids like this are not just only in the slums but in suburbia too. And small towns. And even rural areas. 

This movie isn't for the squeamish but if one parent watches and starts giving their child more attention it might be worth a sleepless night or a feeling of revulsion for them.

This film is a landmark in blending science and advocacy. It seeks to assert that animals lead complex and sophisticated emotional lives, not unlike our own.  But it manages to walk the fine line between subjectivity and objectivity. It avoids going too far into the subjective. It doesn't try to emotionally blackmail the viewer with mere cute/stagey displays of animal interaction. Instead it relies heavily on scientific observation in both natural and controlled environments. But by the sheer genious of editing and writing, one cannot help but be drawn into the lives of these noble creatures just as one would a good drama.  The movie wisely lets the animals' behavior "do the talking", and doesn't try to push the viewers' judgement one way or the other. It left me rethinking everything I had assumed about  animals, emotions, and the nature of our (and by 'our' I mean all of God's creatures) existence

Bob Crane shot to television stardom in the 1960s as the star of the television series Hogan's Heroes. However, while he was enjoying the life of a TV star, he was simultaneously delving into dark territory in his personal life - sexual promiscuity and deviance. Auto Focus tells the story of Bob Crane as a tragic cautionary tale of the dangers of excess.

When the film opens, Bob (Greg Kinnear, in a fantastic performance) is about to hit the big time, and is a loving family man who doesn't drink or smoke. He attends mass on Sundays. One day on the set of Hogan's Heroes, though, his life begins to take a bit of a turn when he meets John Carpenter (Willem Dafoe), a techno-guy with all the latest gadgets, including video equipment, which fascinates Crane.

"Carp" opens the door for Bob to unleash his inner desires, which both excite and frighten him. It begins innocently enough, sitting in on the drums at a strip club, but eventually Bob loses all self-control and ends up making pornographic videos of his exploits and frequently "swinging." All the while Bob refuses to admit that there's anything wrong with him; if you ask him, he'll tell you he's just a normal guy.

After Hogan's Heroes came to an end, Crane took a job with a dinner theatre show, which allowed Crane and Carp to take their liaisons on a traveling show. As Crane's indiscretions get worse, his personal life deteriorates, as he divorces two wives (played by Rita Wilson and Mario Bello).

Auto Focus has been expertly directed by Paul Schrader, who begins the film with bright, glossy colors, then as Crane goes deeper and deeper into his obsessions, the colors fade and the camera becomes unstable, just as Crane does. Kinnear gives the performance of his life, showing us an uptight man who is afraid of his sexual demons turning into an uptight man who lets them take over his life.

The French title of this film is IN EXTREMIS (though translated as TO THE EXTREME) and means 'in desperate circumstances, especially at the point of death'.  Rethinking the story of this interesting but problematic movie in those terms after viewing  gives the cinematic effort more poignancy.  This is a tale of the impact of family, loss of parents, dissolution of the core unit has on us all: in this story we are asked to exam the 'in extremis' state of such trauma.

Thomas (Sbastien Roch) is a hedonist, a handsome young man whose parents died in an Alpine accident, and a man who sleeps with both sexes in a confused state of true identity.  He lives with one of his female lovers who has a young teenage son Grgoire (Jrmy Sanguinetti) whom he loves as a son.  When the mother accidentally dies, Grgoire wants Thomas to be his guardian.  Thomas' lifestyle does not lend itself to fatherhood and though he deeply loves Grgoire, by law and by proclivity he cannot assume the role of foster parent.  Even with the aid of his prostitute sister Anne (Julie Depardieu) he is unable to keep the disappointed Grgoire from being sent to a prison-like orphanage.  Thomas finds solace from his lover Vincent (Aurlien Wiik) and from his excursions into the bohemian all night orgies where he attempts to forget his promise to be available at all times for Grgoire.  Eventually Thomas' devotion to Grgoire overcomes his hedonistic addiction and results in his aiding the boy's escape from the orphanage to move with him to the home in Ibiza his deceased parents owned.  The story has a bizarre but touching ending, which comes totally unexpectedly, and revealing it would ruin the impact and message of the film.

Director/writer Etienne Faure ('Prisonnier', and ' la recherche de Tadzio' which is included on this CD and traces the life of the actor Bjrn Andresen who played Tadzio in the film 'Death in Venice') directs his actors well but is less successful in finding the interaction of flashbacks, fantasies, graphic indulgences and superimposed poetry inundated with noisy music.  But given these distractions the film still makes a simple case for the significance of family - genetic and extended - and therein is the power of the story.  This is obviously the work of a young director with copious ideas about film and as such one can forgive many of the early experimental indulgences because the heart is in the right place.  In French with English subtitles.  Grady Harp, May 05

I always love it when Prevention release another workout because I get bored easy and I like to mix workouts up.  I've loved all of the other Prevention workouts and knew I'd love this too.  Chris Freytag leads again and does another superb job.  There are two aerobic routines and five targeted toning workouts.  The dvd is programmable so you can do them in any order and do as many or as little as you want.  That's a big plus so you don't get bored or pushed for time.  You can choose whether you need to lose weight or just firm up etc.  If, for example, you pick that you need to lose weight, there is a six day week with the routines mapped out for you already.  That is so helpful.  The moves are all basic no frills moves, but they are effective.  The first cardio section is low impact and the second is a variety of low and higher impact moves making it just that little bit harder.  The body parts are all the ones you want to workout; arms, butt, abs and thighs.  All you really need for this dvd is dumbells and a lot of energy.  This is so easy to do due to the programming, so there really is no excuse for not working out.  This can be done by practically anyone.
I also love how the other two girls exercising as well, aren't the kinds that yell and shout etc.  They are as professional as Chris

An absolute must have for all parents, families and professionals!  As a speech &amp; language pathologist, I have worked with special needs children for 17 years, and finally I have viewed a high quality product for children diagnosed with Down Syndrome.  Informative, comprehensive and heart warming are just a few words to describe this excellent DVD.  I would highly recommend it for not only families, but for ALL professionals working with this population.  In fact, I believe it should be part of the training and curriculum for all disciplines intending to serve these wonderful children.  Thanks for a great product

There aren't many films from any era that come close to being "perfect" (though that's not really the right word) in just about every way--probably you could count them on your fingers and have some left over.

"Friendly Persuasion" is one of those films--in spades. Directed by William Wyler and starring Gary Cooper, Dorothy McGuire, and Tony Perkins, it is a wonderful, human story about a loving family of Quakers (also known as Friends) living in one of the Union-Confederate "border" states at the time of the Civil War in the 1860s.

The cast, in small roles and large, is uniformly excellent, none calling attention to themselves but rather becoming their characters and making us understand them. Led by beloved, legendary star Gary Cooper in a great performance as the head of the Quaker family Jess Birdwell, they are marvelous, including child actor Richard Eyer as feisty "Little Jess", scrapping with his big sister or partaking in a running feud with "Samantha", his mother Eliza Birdwell's pet goose, who more than carries her end of the feud with scene-stealing craftiness.

There are incidents of family humor and love and occasional disagreements, and a hilarious episode in which eldest son Josh  (Perkins) accompanies father Jess on a sales trip and is set upon by the scrappy, amorous daughters of one of Jess's customers (Marjorie Main). We are settled into a lovely, lively exploration of the Birdwell family's idyllic existence.

Then the war intrudes.

Josh feels he must volunteer to fight as long as others have to, even though it is against the teachings of his faith. His younger sister loves a young Union officer who is soon to go into battle. Rebel troops are nearing the region where they live, and no one, including the audience, quite knows what will happen.

There is a beautifully honest and dramatic sequence in which young Josh gets his first taste of battle, which Perkins performs with heartbreaking realism. I recall my father, a World War II veteran, saying that this scene was the most realistic depiction of a young man's first time in battle that he had ever seen in the movies.

When it is all over and the Birdwells return to their quiet, hard-working, loving life as a family, the music (Dimitri Tiomkin's marvelous score) swells, the wonderful lyrics to the song "Friendly Persuasion" are sung sweetly by the young Pat Boone, and you realize you have spent two wonderful hours with these genuinely fine, completely human characters in ordinary life and in challenging times.

The story has been told with integrity, honesty, humanity, gentle humor, kind restraint and, yes, love--all of these also attributes of the Birdwell family that we have come to know. That is the "genius" of this film. Along with a very few others, it shows us who we are, who we can be, and how we can live, all with a grace and humility that is almost poetic. And the film never, ever loses its balance.

It's just a great and good movie. I've seen it almost a dozen times, and it can still move me to tears. I'm betting it could be released today, amid the ridiculously over-budgeted, badly executed films that rely too much on computer effects and star charisma, and that it would clean up at the box office.

The term "family values" has been kicked around a lot lately, and nobody quite seems to know what is really meant by it. Watch this truly beautiful film and you'll get a pretty good idea of the genuine meaning of those words.

You want the greatest zombie film ever made in the most deluxe version DVD possible today? Buy this set today, as it includes 3 versions of the film, including Argento's take on the film, known as Zombi: Dawn of the Dead.

Dawn of the Dead has that 79 feel, with wide camera shots that allow the characters to breathe, unlike so many modern horror flicks that smother the stars with endless closeups.

The zombie gore is to be noted, as its quite gory near the end of the film and at some parts throughout, but no real feasting occurs till the end, for the ultimate payoff. Yes, the zombies are pasty and fresh, since the outbreak has just began, which joins a team of four who struggle to survive in a mall while the world is quickly overtaken in this, Dawn of the Dead, easily the strongest Romero entry, and amongst ALL zombie films

It was perfectly constructed to make you want to beg them to make another season or at least a movie

It embarrases me that I, a music man, have let this many years go by without reviewing this splendid movie. My wife rented it from a Hasting's video store back when DVDs were not widely distributed. I was in awe of the movie as it ended because I had no clue what to expect, and I wasn't expecting much anyway.

Richard Dreyfuss plays the role of Glenn Holland, a recent college graduate who takes the job of a music teacher to provide an income (he calls it a 'fall back position') while he writes what he hopes will be a musical masterpiece that will make him rich and famous. His first semester is a trying and learning experience as students see him as that school teacher everybody hated and whose class everyone dreaded.

But he finds his way into the students' hearts. The movie begins in the early 1960s, and rock 'n' roll has etched a permanent mark on the music landscape. Most of the students, of course, love the new music. Realizing he has an 'in' with the students, he makes an accurate comparison by playing Bach's "Minuet in G" (for Anna Magdalena) and asking the students what song it is. They reply it is the "Lovers Concerto" by the Toys ("What color is the rain that falls softly on my window.."). He notes they are wrong and that it is actually the SAME song (although he doesn't note that Bach's is in 3/4 and the Toys in 4/4) and is an example of an ancient music scale called the Dorian scale. He now has them right where he wants them.

Along the way, he continues to work on his masterpiece. But life, a new baby who turns out to be deaf, and the need for new things put his life on hold. As he notes by quoting John Lennon, "Life is what happens while you're making other plans" (or some facsimile thereof). Years continue to go by and events occur that happen in the life of virtually ever music teacher.

He has that one student who has a lot of heart but not a lot of ability - yet needs to get an hour of credit so he can remain eligible to play football. He has another student who wants to play the clarinet but is nervous. Yet he always comes back to the simple rock 'n' roll to make his point about 'real' music.

But reality plays hide and seek sometimes. He has it out with his wife about their deaf son - and his frustrations come to a boiling point on the night John Lennon is killed. Over time, they become friends - and one of the sweet sights of the movie is the son feeling the vibrations from the speaker as he 'hears' the music.

But another reality awaits - education budget cuts, and here Dreyfuss delivers the line with outstanding effect: "The day they cut the football budget in this state...well, that will certainly be the end of western civilization as we know it." It is in the presence of his now good friend, Jay Thomas (the football coach), that he talks about how he never wanted to teach but now that is all he wants to do.

The music track in this movie is awesome. There's just one thing I'm still trying to figure out: how did the students manage to mass distribute his music and practice it without him knowing it?

I was thinking about purchasing all four of these movies, but to have them together in a box set is a beautiful thing. 
I will not bore you with the reviews of these movies, those who love Akira Kurosawa movies sees the stories closely matching those of Shakespeare, a Clint Eastwood Western, and Star Wars.
For the price and what you get, it's a steal

My DVD had English subtitles.  The first act is the best.   Watching the young japanese couple interact is very rewarding.  There is so much subtlety and silent communicating.  No surprise, since it is revealed in the booklet that Jim Jarmusch (director) created this movie around the Japanese actress (Youki Kudoh). 
 'Life is Beautiful' star (and wife of Roberto Benigni), Nicoletta Braschi, stars in the second act.  More great quiet acting.  She is a true beauty.
Funny role by the late Screamin' Jay Hawkins.
Also appearing in the late Joe Strummer of the Clash

SOUND OF MUSIC 40th ANNIVERSARY EDITION (Fox) is the latest digital version of this beloved, timeless, film.  The two-disc set features an exceptionally sharp transfer and a rich audio mix but the real treat is the new commentary with Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer (this in addition to the late Robert Wise's commentary).  

Among the wealth of new treasures in the six hours of extras is on location footage, screen tests (Mia Farrow sings) and a wonderful retrospective documentary "My Favorite Things: Julie Andrews Remembers."  

Sound of Music is perfect in all departments.  It's also that rare musical in which the music itself is naturally integral to the story and a counterpoint to the Nazi threat of the true-life plot.  Until hi-def DVDs arrive, this is the definitive edition for the library.
  
Rated: G.  Genre: Musical.  2 Hours, 56 Minutes.  Starring: Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer.  Director: Robert Wise

    This is my first review for Amazon. I've always felt that the reviews that I read were adequate to represent the movies and anime that I liked. Not this time.
    I have an extensive collection of anime. Everything from the really silly stuff, filled with fan service, to the very serious classics that so many fans rave about. I'm not really into the mecha thing, though I do have a lot of it. It's the animation first that drives my interest, then its the story and the character development are close seconds. 
    Appleseed has all that I'm looking for in an anime, and in Spades. Great characters, a well crafted plot, and some of the best animation I have ever see. To say, as some reviewers have, that the movement in this version are unnatural,is more than unfair, it's just not true. All action is extremely lifelike, and the action scenes are the best I've ever seen. I actually found myself reversing the disc to rewatch some action repeatedly, something I never do.
    I've owned this version of Appleseed a few weeks now, and I have watched it at least five times, and am looking forward to another veiwing soon.
    I have relied on Amazon  reveiws to decide whether or not to buy anime in the past, so I hope that this reveiw is helpful. There is a lot of good anime worth investing in, and this one is near the top of my list

This is a great tape for anyone who wants a challenge!  You will deinately feel it in the legs.  I have the Ultimate Step Circuit and Burn and Firm and prefer this one as it seems to take you to depletion...until you can't do anymore.  Karen Voight is excellent at cueing and reminding about technique.  Comparable to The Firm Lower Body Split...another 5 star recommendation for feeling the burn

I love the Simpsons!  Although the early seasons are classic, they seem to get better and more funny as they go on.  This season includes the episode where Milhouse's parents get divorced which is hilarious, and the one where Homer eats those hot chili peppers and freaks out!  Definitely worth the purchase, there are a lot of extras too

"Animal House" raised the bar, and set a standard for all comedies that followed. Many have tried to duplicate the originality of this movie, and all have failed to come close.

Sandra Bullock gives an outstanding and believable performance in the role of Angela Bennett.  In this film she plays the part of a solitary and lonely computer expert. An online hacker friend calls to tell her he's found an amazing disk and is sending it to her to check out.  Unfortunately, he's killed in a plane crash before he can visit her. The disk turns out to have secret government information and is wanted by a terrorist group who plan the downfall of the U.S. government. Angela Bennett recognizes that the disk is something special and before she really realizes what she has, she finds that she's being stalked. What happens next is everyone's worst nightmare. Through the miracle of computers, the evil group steal Angela's identify and there are few people to vouch for her. The story quickly turns into a cyber thriller.

She tries to get help, but she appears to have no friends and doesn't even know her own neighbors. Her mother (Diane Baker) is in an institution and is apparently suffering from Alzheimer's.  Her former boyfriend, played by Dennis Miller does try to help her, but the forces of evil are difficult to hide from. 

Jeremy Northam delivers a spine tingling performance as the charming and mysterious Jack Devlin. A man you really want to trust, but should you?

Actually I felt I was in love with this film as soon as I saw the very beginning - the opening credits against the background of Chicago seen from high above and provided with beautiful music. "Candyman" could have become another teenage urban legend flick with not much of a sense, but Bernard Rose managed to squeeze everything possible from the story making a brilliant, enchanting and spellbinding film out of it. If you're interested mostly in gore and some physical manifestations of horror you won't find it here (you will, but not in quantities you used to). "Candyman" is more of a psychological horror where atmosphere is what's important, where mood is what matters, where you are given some food for thought. I don't have enough words to describe the whole perfection of this gorgeous film, I can only say it's a great achievement of Bernard Rose as a director besides I guess Tony Todd, Virginia Madsen and Xander Berkeley had their best roles played in this feature. 
I don't personally think that 90s were fertile regarding the horror genre, but "Candyman" is a true gem which wouldn't be lost among the greatest horror titles of all times. 
By the way if you don't want to spoil your impression of the film, better don't watch "Candyman" parts 2 and 3. They ARE the average tenage urban legend flicks.

This exercise video was very easy to get started on and you could do all the exercises in very limited space.  This is great for people who do not have alot of room.  After exercising to the video, I felt really good, energized.  I would definitely recommend it to someone who is just starting out exercising. It is low impact and easy to follow

WOW.  That's the only thing I can say after reading all sorts of negative reviews.  I admit, the very first time I watched the Grudge with my father NEITHER of us thought the movie was scary at all and couldn't understand its success, but after watching the movie a second time two months later by myself late at night I REALLY began to see how frightening the movie is.  Probably contains the same amount of fear as the original Exorcist, another movie that's really effectively well done.  You HAVE to watch the Exorcist and the Grudge at night to get the proper effect.  

The Grudge benefits greatly when it comes to maintaining a moody atmosphere and a pretty interesting story.  I say "pretty interesting" because the storyline isn't the best, or the easiest to understand.  Just interesting enough to get the job done.  The Grudge also benefits when it comes to not giving away too much or too little.  In fact, this is probably its strongest point.  

Every time something scary happens, you see just a "little bit" of that scary monster boy or some kind of strange shadow effect, which is *very* important if you want to effectively scare someone.  If the scary boy had appeared on screen for longer than a few seconds it wouldn't have scared me nearly as much because I would have gotten used to seeing it.  The boy appears, and then he's gone.  Not giving away too much REALLY works with this movie.  You see, to really scare me you simply CAN'T put a scary monster on screen for long periods of time and you HAVE to create a moody atmosphere to make the film believable.  The Grudge works *extremely* well it this area.  

The fact that something scary happens almost always unexpectedly in the Grudge allows me to give the film another compliment.  I'm telling you, the scene with the woman inside that building by herself (well, except for a security guard) and having to travel home to an apartment building all by herself is about 10 minutes of total bone-chilling excitement.  I *loved* this scene.  

I was totally on the edge of my seat wondering when the woman was finally going to have something bad happen to her.  The scene where the woman saw darkness coming before walking down the stairs and having to hurry up to get out of there was *awesome*, and the scene a few moments after this happened where she DID see something in the shadow was ANOTHER awesome display of bone-chilling brilliance.  There's a bunch of scenes like this throughout the movie.  Freakin' AWESOME!  

Excellent pacing and suspense makes the Grudge a true horror classic, in my opinion.  I've seen a thousand horror movies in my time and I'd easily put the Grudge right up there as one of the best.  

People today have drastically different opinions when it comes to what makes a movie scary.  Remember the good old days when everyone could agree that the Exorcist was the scariest movie of all-time?  I wish everyone agreed that the Grudge is a total classic, and that the Ring is another excellent one.

This is a fine, leveled workout, including stretching, aerobics, abdominal exercises and strength training moves (without weights). Gilad takes you through it with plenty of advance cues and tips to help you change moves smoothly, and position yourself properly for optimum muscle and cardiac work. The 30 minute workout is just right for an early-morning, before work routine. The 60 minute version is an extended workout good for weekends. Much better than most of these videos, this is particularly well suited to middle aged fitness buffs.

So, why give Justice League the full 5 stars?  Because it appeals to every generation in my family.  I bought this for my 4 year old son who is enamored with superheros.  As we hung out together watching the shows, I was as engrossed in the story as my son.  Then I noticed that my wife was intrigued; and so were the grandparents!  The characters and plots are very well developed for a "cartoon", so it is more like watching a dramatic series.  Watching the series allows you to pick up on sub-plots too; like the attraction between Batman and WonderWoman - Jean Jone's struggle to find a place as the last of his people - and the entire groups struggle to work together as a cohesive team.  Another excellent buy to consider would be the Spiderman the New Animated Series

"Dave" is a lot of fun, as a look-alike gets to pretend to be president, gradually gets a big head and tries to use the power, and makes high-stakes enemies. I am a big fan of Sigourney Weaver, and she is very good here. Kevin Kline does well, as well. The forces of good beat back the dark side of politics for awhile, and an ordinary guy finds extraordinary adventure and true love. Definitely worth a rental, if romantic and comic politics with a bit of danger is your bag

I first saw this movie on TV as a college student. I loved it so much that an old boyfriend went out and bought it for me on VHS tape. I have watched this movie so many times I'm surprised the VHS tape is still working!

The actors are perfectly cast in the leads. They are so believeable in their portrayals that I could have gone to high school with them. The kissing scene is HOT. Clothes don't need to come off for you to feel the hot wind of chemistry and passion that blows off that first kiss scene.

The characters are not glossy, and that is what I love about John Hughes. He portrays coming-of-age in all its naked and truest glory, not the perfect airbrushed schlock that has come out in later years.

If you're looking to see character development and great plot set to a great soundtrack, this is your type of movie

This movie was both entertaining and at times, hilarious.  Charlie Sheen is great as the fallen stockbroker turned advice columnist, Denise Richards is funny as his ditzy, shallow girlfriend and Angie Harmon is appealing as the editor of the newspaper.  Also, Jon Lovitz is hysterical as Sheen's plastic surgeon best friend.  This movie is a must for those who want some lighthearted humor.  I highly recommend it.

"Panic Room" is a great thriller- Jodie Foster's return to the big screen.  I'd assume most people would enjoy the film itself.  However, the real treat in the 3-Disc Special Edition is the behind-the-scenes footage explaining the wondeful camera work and production in the film.  Any movie lover will be blown away by the creativity and the vision the director brings to this picture

I've never been quite a fan of music DVDs.  By that I mean the live stuff.  I much rather be there to experience it then sit at home pretending I'm there.  That's one side of it.  I'm also a huuuuuge Gorillaz fan.  And I have seen them live.  The show to their self titled debut. But don't get me wrong, that doesn't make me biased towards everything they put out.  On the contrary it leaves me to judge them on a higher level because I only expect the best from what they've given.

With that said, this has to be literally one of the best music DVDs I have encountered in quite some time.  Don't worry about extras, documentaries, which while would have been nice to show how it was put together, are not here.  Which makes sense since the band itself is very discreet they wouldn't show you all that.

The show itself was amazing, and it literally jumps off screen as you watch this, and I recommend you have a decent audio system as well.  The amazing sound quality coupled by the beautiful visuals is astonishingly done well.  The editing and the post production were so well conceived they worked on this like a labour of love and not just another DVD to sell.  From start to end it will leave you speechless.  As you stare in awe at the grandioso that is the Gorillaz, you realise that while at first you figured them to be a fictious band in every aspect, they are quite real and very capable of producing grand music on every level.  You can tell by this by the standing ovation and after the show and after the encore.  Only few bands have ever been able to touch me musically on such a deep level. And to put on such a show which normally you could only catch at the studio over a period of months to produce is a feat in itself.

If you want special features videos and documentaries get the 2 other DVDs especially now since they just released their newest one.  Those will fill in all that nicely.  But even if you're not a fan or just a new convert, I highly recommend you own this.  No matter the age, or person you are, (you notice this on the DVD as well) and regardless of what your favourite genre is.  Because they are so massive they can't be contained into one.

Thank you Damon and Jamie for such an experience, mates

Flight from death is a "must see" documentary. I saw it three times since i've received the DVD last week and each time i discover new aspects. Images are beautiful and the commentary (narrated by Gabriel Byrne) is just outstanding. Before seeing it, i was a little bit anxious to see how they can translate in a documentary the rather complex thought of Ernest Becker. As a reader of Becker's books for many years i can tell that Patrick Sean and Greg Bennick had done a fantastic job. Each important parts of Becker's understanding of the impact of death anxiety on human behavior are explored and very well explained. I understand now why this documentary won seven prizes. Please do not hesitate to buy this DVD you won't regret it!

I did not have any of the original trilogy on DVD.  I am happy to have the theatrical releases as I am not a fan of the SE's, particularly Jedi.  I was nervous due to bad reviews, but they look and sound great.  If you like Star Wars and want the original releases I highly recommend these.  If you already happily own the SE's or are feeling cheated or robbed in some way by repeated releases of the same movie, then don't buy these.

Hollywood make them, then they break them -- stars can fall as fast as they rise. Sometimes they rise again, and sometimes they disappear. 

And Christopher Guest casts a jaded eye on the fickle ups and downs of Hollywood in "The Big Picture," a quirky, cynical movie which focuses on what the successful should never let go of. It has a few awkward stretches, but overall it's a darkly witty cult comedy ("You're tracking failure all over my carpet!").

Nick Chapman (Kevin Bacon) is the winner at an arty student movie competition, and instantly agents are chasing him all over L.A. In no time, he's the Rising Young Director, with a movie deal at a major movie corporation. But he's also starting to lose sight of his old life, as he tries to become a major success.

He changes the style, plot and characters of his arty movie for demographics, turning it into a beach bums/naked ghost movie. He dumps his pretty girlfriend (Emily Longstreth) for a bimbo actress (Teri Hatcher). When the studio head gets dropped, Nick falls as quickly as he rose. But a chance encounter with an old pal gives him a second chance -- an arty music video. This time, can he get it right?

Christopher Guest is best known for his brilliant mockumentaries, tackling everything from small-town musicals to folk festivals. His forthcoming one is another one about showbiz. But his talents are just as present in a "typical" movie, and Guest does a smart, quirky job of it.

The lesson: Be true to yourself and your art, don't fall for empty glitz, and don't let success go to your head if you're lucky enough to get it. 

The story is a pretty straightforward one -- Nick gets great success, it goes to his head, he falls, and he rises again a wiser man. And the movie falls into straightforward lines, without many unpredictable plot twists. At first glance, it doesn't seem that unusual.

What makes it special? Well, simply put, Guest manages to infuse it with his unique type of wit, like the oddballish Pez music video and the noir fantasies of Nick's life. Not to mention the glorious dialogue. When speaking of Nick's one'n'only music video, a studio woman announces, "It's the best one yet, and I've seen 'em ALL!"

And Guest manages to show us agents, artists, students, directors and actors, but never descended to cliches. They're real people, no matter how nasty. And Bacon does a solid job as a young man who learns how empty glitz is. His best scene is the reunion with his friend Emmet, where he confesses, "I wanna be your friend again." And he's backed by good performances by Longstreth, Michael McKean and a dancing Jennifer Jason Leigh.

"Big Picture" treads where many movies have gone before, but it does so with an approach as fresh as a Pez People music video. A must-see

I was fourteen years old when I attended the New York Premier of this movie at the Rivoli Theater. I have the original Premier Book from the theater; which is NOT for sale. I immediately fell in love with the beautiful Ingrid Bergman. So did millions of other young men. This movie did not win the award of the year; it was overshadowed by "Casablanca"; which in my estimation, was of inferior quality, compared to For Whom the Bell Tolls.  Bob Richard

Terms of Endearment captivates me with the believable relationship of mother and daughter as brilliantly portrayed by 
Shirley MacLaine and Debra Winger.  It covers approximately 30 years of the turbulent yet loving relationship between mom Aurora and daughter Emma.  They have their differences; yet the love between them is always so obvious.  It's also refreshing how they seem to be able to talk about anything with each other, even their sex lives.  

I've seen this movie several times, and everytime I cry at the end.  In spite of the death, the movie ends on a positive note, giving us the feeling that life is going on and everything is going to be okay.  

The budding relationship between Aurora and her neighbor (also brilliantly portrayed by Jack Nicholson) creates a plot-within-a-plot that is very entertaining and provides some comic relief from the sadness of the relationship between Emma and her husband and children.  

The most interesting aspect is that Emma gets so bent out of shape when she finds out that her husband has been cheating on her, when she has been cheating on him as well.  Somehow though we sympathize with Emma and her gentle lover (played by the very talented John Lithgow).  We feel like they belong together and somehow their relationship doesn't seem wrong.

If you are in the mood for a movie that is entertaining and gut-wrenching at the same time, this is a perfect choice

...but the movie was pretty good. I found myself highly disappointed in the book, and almost wasn't able to finish it. The characters were flat, the story reading like a history lesson in religion through the ages, and not a true story, so I wasn't sure what to make of the movie. I was pleasantly surprised though, to enjoy the movie immensely. It was long, but it kept the pace going throughout. The subtitling in the Latin and French was a bit mundane to drudge through, but it made the movie a bit more 'believable' than everyone speaking English when the main character is actually French.

Teabing was played brilliantly, and while Hanks was not who I would have thought for Langdon, he did a superb job in the role.

If you can set your personal beliefs aside and view the movie as a piece of exceptional fiction drama and suspense, it is well worth watching. Murder, mystery, suspense, action, drama... it's all there in this film

The BBC created the perfect cast in this terrific film. Watching it is like entering into a more pleasant world than the one that exists today. It is lavishly adorned with beautiful costume and sets. The latest adaptation is an insult to the major players in the BBC version. Highly recommend to those who love Jane Austin and her works

i haven't seen this movie in years so when i saw it at block-
busters i had to rent it. my favorite part is when tom essex
played by the handsome dana ashbrook put a screwdriver threw the
head and the head said "get that damn screwdriver out of my head" i couldn't stop laughing it was so funny. i never really liked many horror-comedy movies but this one is really good.
the best actor in this movie was dana ashbrook, he was not only
funny but he was very brave and sexy to boot.
if not many people liked this movie at lease watch it for his performance because he was amazing. he makes me want to watch it
over and over and over again

I saw Transamerica months ago and I still think about it.  There are many reasons, most obviously Felicity Huffman's portrayal of Bree, a man determined to become a woman, trying to close the door on his past, just as it unexpectedly reopens to disclose an heretofore unknown and decidedly lost child.  But Transamerica also brings a funny, poignant, and at times visually beautiful road trip across the United States, in an old car that you wonder how it could make 50 miles, let alone 3000.  It brings unexpected and uncertain romance.  It brings out humanity in all its characters (save one minor one), including Bree's bitter mother.  Finally, it -- plot spoiler here -- concludes with tentative reconciliation, acceptance, and an uncertain but potentially hopeful future.  Transamerica is not loud, not big budget, not spectacular, but there are few movies near as good as it.

THIS IS A DVD THAT I THOUGHT WAS DATED. NOT!  IT WAS MADE IN 2002/3, AND DESERVES WIDE VIEWING.  I THOUGHT I MAY HAVE SEEN THE TITLE, BUT I HAD NOT. IT MAY BE CONFUSED WITH OTHER PREVIOUS SIMILAR TITLES. DONT PASS THIS BY, IT IS GRITTY AND ARTISTICALLY REALISTIC.  THE GRIT OF SOUTH CENTRAL L.A., IS AUTHENTIC AND HAS ITS OWN PARTICULAR BIG CITY BEAUTY OF A SLUM AREA.  SHARE THIS DVD OR TITLE WITH FRIENDS....IT IS WELL WORTH THE RIDE IN A BLACK AND WHITE. IT IS SIMILAR TO "THE SHIELD" ON FX, BUT DEALS WITH THE RODNEY KING RIOTS IN L.A., AS A BACKDROP.

Small town America... only this isn't the pleasant and white-picketed small town America of film noir fame, it's the gray and colorless small town America of neo-noir, and there's the man on the sidewalk looking like a lost bum to prove it.  A bum who's being approached by that famous "Man in a Black Trenchcoat"...

Hard Eight (AKA Sydney, but I've yet to see a version of it anywhere that actually claims that title) is a debut pretty much as promising as Blood Simple to the brothers Coen.  Paul Thomas Anderson immediately sets out to give us only the best, with actors he wants to make famous and a script that has characters doing almost nothing we want (or expect) them to do, but who yet remain completely sympathetic throughout.

Anderson also uses neo-noir color to great effect, allowing red and blue to do what harsh black and white contrast is supposed to do in classical noir.  That said, Anderson still knows where the majority of the talent lies, and despite the long takes and steady-cam shots that would develop into those dizzying long takes from later movies, he focuses most of his time on the characters' faces, and just lets them be.

If he hadn't already done the amazing and always stunning later work of Magnolia, Boogie Nights, and Punch Drunk Love, I'd say that this is a "promising debut that makes me impatient for the next Anderson picture to come out," but since he does now have four classics notched into his belt, I must say, "See this to see Anderson at his roots," and "Man I can't wait for his next feature!"

This movie was the first DVD I ever bought!  It is truly a gem.  I like the Infinifilm bonus features.  (It may not have been called Infinifilm at this time.)  Brett Ratner is truly a comedic genius, and really gives the customer great quality DVD's.  

The movie is funny and interesting enough.  I enjoyed the scenes in several different locales.  I enjoyed the physical interactions between Jackie and Chris Tucker.  I think the stunts were wonderfully orchestrated.  Jackie Chan is a genius at physical comedy.

I highly recommend this DVD.

Two thumbs up!!!

I have been following the Laughing Man fansubs, so I've covered all this material before. I'm acquiring the DVDs as they come out to have legit copies.

The desc says 2 collectibles toys, it's actually 3. There is Batou on the plate like Motoko from Vol 3. In fact, the base plates fit together, which makes me belive that vol 5 will have another piece that will fit together to complete a composite set. The other two toys are the Chinese assassin with the gun-arm and the old robot unit from the organ-farming business (with the fake southern accent). These are easier to put together, I had problems with the Tachikoma from the last set, it broke when I tried to put the legs on. Haven't gotten around to the super-glue session yet.

The product itself: Stand Alone Complex - 2nd Gig continues some of the best animation and smartest television ever produced. Buy it, share it with those persons worthy/capable of appreciating it

I am a huge U2 fan and this is the BEST concert I have ever seen.  This concert is simply unbeliveable.  It proves to all those stupid people that the belief that U2 were only good in the 80s and 90s is a load of garbage.  U2's still got it.  This concert proves it.  If you don't think U2's good anymore, go watch this concert.  All that You Can't Leave Behind is a good album.  Maybe not as good as Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby but it is still good.  How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb left a little to be desired.  And for the stupid guy at the beginning of these reviews (I think it was the first one) what do you mean Bono was supporting homosexuality???????????  When he kissed Edge, it was representing the betrayal of Jesus Christ.  Look up the lyrics to the song that they were singing,  "Until the End of the World."  "I took the money... I kissed your lips (face in the concert) and broke your heart."  Bono represents Judas Iscariot in the song.  Also, if you still don't believe me and think this is some love song or something, watch any U2 concert with this song- almost all of them show Bono doing a little devil-horn thing, usually after kissing Edge (Christ) The only thing I agree with in that guy's review is that Edge really is the spirit of the band, not Bono.  I love the delay that Edge uses in his guitar.  And I hate how when people think of U2 they think of Bono.  Bono's fine but I love how Edge plays.  Anyway, go read his review if you want to find out more.  Just don't listen to that homosexuality crap.  Anyway, this concert is awesome and I could just watch it over and over again.  In fact, I'm actually watching it tonight!  Great show- makes you feel like you're actually there.  U2 is a wonderful band with good Christian messages in their songs and I can't wait for their next album and concert to come out

Flashdance with Jennifer Beals is such a 80's icon movie and not only that but it has a amazing soundtrack to follow.... Alex played by Jennifer is a trying to start a career as a dancer,but has no experience from any dance school. So she wants to impress a bunch of dance people to let her in their school.... The movie has great scencic views and has great songs from a amazing soundtrack.... Jennifer Lopez's song " I'm Glad" has a Flashdance theme so if you ever get the chance check out that video.... If you love your 80 movies then rent this one tonight!!!!!!!!

This is a visually elegant and thematically frightening movie. It conjures up some authentically unearthly and mysterious atmosphere. Once agan the outstanding musical accompaniment of TOMANDANDY helps to elevate the film to a level of dread not seen since DON'T LOOK NOW back in '73. This was a strangely malinged and neglected film at the time of its release but i think history will mark it out, alongside WHITE NOISE, as the best of the thrillers that came out in the wake of The success of THE SIXTH SENSE.

I should say up front that I have never played chess, nor do I understand the game. But I remember being intrigued about the film when I saw the theatrical trailer. Was I intrigued because of the fact that the film was about a young boy with a special gift of a game? Was it the intense images of competition? Was it a curiosity about the game of chess itself and how it was played? Or was it about a deeper struggle within the boy? The answer is all of the above. "Searching For Bobby Fischer" is an excellent family film for all. I am living proof that even those who don't know jack about chess will love this movie. It is a movie not just about chess, but about acceptance, the bond of love and friendship, compassion for others, and not being afraid to be who you want to be. The balance of drama with edge-of-your-seat competition makes this a truly remarkable film.

Max Pomeranc plays the young and sensitive Josh Waitzkin, a pint-sized seven-year old with a cute lisp, who becomes fascinated with the "lower class" men playing chess in a New York park. He watches the men, his eyes shifting with each move of the pieces. He convinces his mother to go to the park with him, where he plays a game of chess with an older gentleman. It is there that Josh's mother realizes her son has a knack for chess. Also noticing Josh is the fast-talking park chess player, Vinnie (a funny and great performance from Laurence Fishburne) who befriends the boy and eventually teaches him a thing or two about the game. After a match with Josh, Josh's father (played by Joe Mantegna) realizes his son's special gift and enlists the help of a stern but knowledgeable chess teacher named Bruce (played by Ben Kingsley) to make Josh an even better chess master. Bruce sees a young Bobby Fischer in Josh and cannot resist the temptation to take him under his wing and perhaps fill the void that Bobby Fischer left in the country after his mysterious disappearance. Through all the technical strategies of the game being learned, Josh and Bruce develop a good friendship and with Bruce's help, combined with his own special gift, Josh excels in chess tournaments and collects a shiny bundle of trophies. But there may be a test even harder than becoming a grand master of chess.

We've all heard of parents trying to live their dreams through their children, especially when a parent sees a special gift in their child. But what happens when the thrill of competition and the persistent need to win cloud the parents' mind too much? And what happens when a beloved teacher wants you to be a carbon copy of someone or something that you're not? These are tests that run way deeper for Josh Waitzkin than any chess tournament. Josh learns quickly how addictive competition is and how obsessed people can become with a certain game. In his own way, the insightful Josh shows his father and teacher that he is not one of these people who lives and breathes chess like Bobby Fischer did. In the process, Josh pushes his father and teacher's feelings about him and the game of chess to the brink where they find they have to rethink their feelings. It's a matter of what is more important: chess competition, or love? Through it all, the three of them find that they can tolerate losing at chess but cannot tolerate losing something more dear; love and friendship for each other no matter what. There are some truly touching scenes in the film from the lecture Josh receives from his dad in the pouring rain, to the visit from his teacher at the Chicago tournament which comes toward the end of the show. But amongst the competition and drama, there are some nice comic scenes from Vinnie's trash talking against the others in the park, to the scene where the all the parents are literally locked up away from their kids during a tournament because they are so obnoxious, to the humorous appearance by William H. Macy when he offers to get Josh's dad a tuna sandwich. 

The climax comes in the huge chess championship at the end of the film where Josh takes Bruce and Vinnie's teachings along with his own style of playing and faces off against another chess prodigy named Jonathan. Jonathan is a boy I feel sorry for in the film. Playing since he was four years old, all Jonathan knows is chess and goes about life with a glazed expressionless look on his face. Perhaps this boy is proof of what living for a game can do to you, especially when you cannot just be a kid.

The acting is terrific. Ben Kingsley, Max Pomeranc and Joe Mantegna give us a very touching and real performance in this film. It's too bad that Pomeranc did not act much since this film because he was a great little actor and very convincing. A nice touch to the movie is the real black and white film clips of a very young Bobby Fischer talking about and playing chess with Pomeranc narrating along. It gives us a bit of the history of the world's greatest chess player and also gives us the implication that people were searching for a new chess hero to fill the void when Bobby Fischer vanished; enter Josh Waitzkin.

"Searching For Bobby Fischer" is one of those stand-up-and-cheer films that is perfect fun for the whole family with some valuable lessons to be learned as well! This is a movie you'll want to watch time and time again.

While this certainly isn't the best pearl jam concert ever it isn't the worst either. The first disc starts a little slow..but you can't argue with getting to hear song's like "In My Tree" and "Faithfull".

Highlights are:

Love Boat Captain...a nice opener. One of the best of riot act song's for sure.

In My Tree, one of, if not my favorite pj songs. Not quite as rocking as the 2000 tour performances but still great.

Gimme Some Truth.  Maybe not a technically perfect perfomance but heartfelt and passionate. Good john lennon cover.

Even Flow. Always great.

Spin the black circle...the band starts to get more into the show after this rocking performance.

Thumbing My Way...just a great slow song.

Breath. In my opinion the best performance of the show...just great.

Crown of Thorns. I really like this version of the song...played well whether you think ed should sing it or not.

Baba O'Reilly.  The classic "who" song. A great performance. Just try to sit still during this one.

I would reccomend this dvd to anyone that is a pearl jam fan already but if you're not then I would start with some of their studio albums first.

This re-telling of the so-called "zoot suit riots" that rocked the Los Angeles homefront during World War II gets the facts right, but tells them rather poorly.  Part of it is the super-stagey presentation, which basically is a filming of the play this was based on (right down to the shaking props and backdrops) and which takes little advantage of the possibilities of the film medium. Plus, Edward James Olmos is absolutely insufferable as the uber-symbolic Voice of The Barrio, although Daniel Valdez and Tyne Daly (!) are okay in their respective roles as a young man railroaded by the white establishment for a crime he did not commit, and as the commie agitator who comes to his defense.  Anyone interested in the time period and in Chicano politics may benefit from watching this -- I rented it while doing some reseach on the "pachucho" R&B music scene -- but in dramatic and filmic terms, this is not a first-rate production.  It's hammy and ham-fisted.  Latter-day star spotting:  El Teatro Campesion veteran Robert Beltran (of future "Star Trek Voyager" notoriety) has a bit role as a modern-day audience member..

Cast:  Denzel Washington, John Goodman, Donald Sutherland, Embeth Davidtz, James Gandolfini, Elias Koteas, Gabriel Casseus, Michael J. Pagan.
Running Time:  123 minutes
Rated R for violence and language.

"Fallen" starts with convicted serial killer Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas) being executed in the gas chamber as the man who brought him to justice Detective Jon Hobbes (Denzel Washington) looks on. Hobbes thinks that this is the end but soon has to rethink as he receives a phone call which tells him to check a house out where he finds a dead man named Muscovich (Glen Witko) in a bathtub having been poisoned, the same way Reese used to kill his victims. At first Hobbes fears a copy cat killer but during the course of his investigation the name Robert Milano comes up, a decorated cop who apparently committed suicide. Hobbes speaks with his daughter Gretta (Embeth Davidtz) who at first is reluctant to speak with him. Things become even stranger when the man who killed Muscovich, Charles (Robert Joy) is found dead in exactly the same way having been poisoned again. Eventually Gretta tells Hobbes the truth, he is in fact dealing with an ancient demon called Azazel who has the power to jump form body to body at will by mere psychical touch. The demon Azazel seems to be taunting Hobbes, ruining his life & career, setting him up for murder & getting to his friends & family. Hobbes must find a way to destroy the ancient demon before it destroys him & everyone he cares about.

Charismatic leading man Denzel Washington is suitably cast as the protagonist and proves to have range, while John Goodman is okay but greatly underused while the same applies to James Gandalfini who plays almost the exact same character. Donald Sutherland doesn't prove to have any range, doing the usual gruff routine that he does in nearly all of his movies. Embeth Davidtz is a talented and totally under-rated actress. She delivers a good performance and shows great potential for the future.  The directing and camera work in this movie was superb. It was done in such a way where you can see Azazel's spirit go from person to person simply by following the camera up and down the crowd and watching the subtle touches one makes in a normal walk about town.  Although this film does require your full attention, it does not go unrewarded and you are not left at the end scratching your head wondering what had happened for the past two hours.  "Fallen" is an intelligently written, supremely efficiently executed, and one of the most unheralded, unnoticed thrillers of the late part of the decade.  One of the better of its kind

all things aside, the other kid in the movie the caddie friend that has the episode at the end [stated this way without ruining the ending]played a great part as a supporting actor. his name is justin goncalves i think. this kid was very believable in every aspect of the part he played. in fact i think he stole the scenes when he was onscreen with the gamble kid. believability is important and this kid carried his weight the entire movie for what limited scenes he had. i was particularly impressed with the part he played.

I watched this film at the suggestions of a friend...Had to watch it again the very next night and have seen it several times since.  It's so nice to watch a film where people are acutally nice to each other and there is no offensive language or elicit scenes.
Just recently learned of some friends in a very similar situation and recommended the film to them to help work throught the emotions they are having.  Livvy, a young and educated woman finds herself pregnant shortly following the death of her mother.  The father of her baby leaves the scene and Livvy's father insists that she will not have a child out of wedlock and so arranges her marriage to a lonely farmer in a very rural area of Colrado.  Ray (the farmer) is shy and reserved, but was brought up with high moral values and treats Livvy like she is something special.  The rest of the movie develops the story of how Ray and Livvy get acquainted and eventually fall in love, even though that was not Livvy's original intention. 
I think the film has a powerful message about forgiveness and forbearance.  I have purchased several copies and love to share it with friends.  I HIGHLY recommend it!!!!

This one of those movies that I can watch over and over again.  The story is great, acting is good, and seeing the jerks get it in the end is the best.   The force of nature is just amazing to me and given the opportunity I would love to go on a Tornado hunt.  The special effects in the movie are very well done and realistic and the ending is perfect for this movie.  I would of given this one 5 stars but it has to be one heck of a movie for 5 stars.  The loss of a star is for some of the actors average job at there parts.  Rent it, buy it, watch it!  It is well worth your time and money.

I enjoyed this wholeheartedly. Mainly because wwe did a little tweak on the formula. Instead of mimicking the one-time use of the Flair dvd formula or using the formula that everyone else gets this three disc sets spreads everything around. All the featured stars get their own video package highlighting parts of their career that made them famous or recognizable. Then every wrestler gets their own match, some of which overlap which makes things interesting. Although we do see some perennial "best of" favorites it was nice to see some obscure pieces of footage. Who would have guessed Sal Bellomo would be on a dvd in the 2000's. If wwe continues releases with rarer footage, I think they'll have a better chance at impressing the older members of the fanbase

I purchased this DVD because it said it was an easier pilates video to do; basically anyone, even beginners, could do it.  I have to disagree.  I started this video and tried to do all of the 5, ten minute sections.  It wasn't completely hard, but definitely challenging.  I am not the most fit person, but also not the most unfit.  I had a harder time because I am just not as limber as you should be to use this pilates video.  I am not saying I wouldn't suggest it, I am just saying it's not definitely for beginners.  However, the instructions are clear and since it's broken up into the five-ten minute sections it gets even lazy people like me to get off the couch and do it

Great improvements over the original DVD. Enhanced for 16x9 TVs with scenes that are now clearer and actually 2.35:1 widescreen ratio.  The original dvd claims an aspect ratio of "approximately 2.35:1" which was not true. I own both versions and have compared viewing aspects  of each. Clearly this DVD is far superior and well worth the purchase price.  This plays very well on my HDTV monitor; I'll give the old version to someone w/ an old 4x3 TV.

Not very familiar with Noam Chomsky's work but I have listened to many people say that he has very strong arguments. This film is proof of those arguments. Noam Chomsky has facts, refers to original sources, provides context and analysis and leaves  you feeling that you have heard a very solid and well-research argument. This film is a collection of such arguments on issues and events affecting many of us in the world. America's invasion of Iraq, the war on terror and what is behind it other than 9-11, and other topics are rich and insightful. This film provides a nice balance on Chomsky by giving us some insight into HIM which is interesting. I find him more fascinating now than I did as a skeptic who was challenged to actually read his material. This film gives those new to Noam Chomsky's books an excellent overview of the issues and events that he has written about in the last five years or so. After watching this film I went out and read 9-11 and his latest book. While good, the film gives us the same information but in a more direct and candid manner.

Having an M.A. in English literature as well as a B.A. in literature and history, anytime a movie is BOTH historical AND literary . . . well, I get a bit excited to say the least. I don't wish to give the impression that this movie is based on absolute and authentic history because it's not, but the writers/directors/producers set it against a "historical" backdrop nonetheless. On that note, this is yet another stellar title from noneother than Ridley Scott. With that being said, I enjoyed "Tristan and Isolde" almost as much as "Gladiator" and a bit more than "Kingdom of Heaven" (all of these, by the way, are Ridley Scott films). Notice the historical adaptations here? 

While it may be true that the story of Tristan and Isolde was inspirational to Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet" as well as possibly fueling much of the intrigue of the Arthurian legend, this movie is not exclusively for the high-browed college types. No sir, good ol' red-blooded men and women will certainly be drawn into both the action as well as the romance in this movie. This is by no means a "chick flick" since there is present a large degree of bloodshed and overall suspense. On the other hand, it's not the typical "hack and slash" macho film because at its core is a very dynamic love story. In short, it should please both sexes simultaneously. 

Aside from James Franco (Tristan), I was rather unfamiliar with most of the cast. Sophia Myles (Isolde) is, for the most part, a newcomer to American audiences despite a rather large resume in mostly British films. I suspect this film will provide her the recognition she certainly deserves on this side of the Atlantic. While many of the other characters were convincing in their roles, no other character was more believable in his villainy than that of the arrogant Irish king (who just so happens to be Isolde's father). 

In short, this is one of the best movies I've seen in awhile. On some levels it reminds me of "King Arthur." Just as "King Arthur" attempted to provide a plausible history of the legendary Arthur, Guinevere, and Lancelot, so too does Ridley Scott by placing the action a few years after the establishment of the Angle and Saxon kingdoms in England. If you'll recall in "King Arthur," Arthur helps hold back the onslaught of the invading Saxons just as the Roman legions were exiting Britannia. Historians will point out that there is no evidence of Saxons in England until several decades AFTER the Roman withdrawal, but oh well . . . it made for a good story. Here, we witness the Celtic Britons as they are exploited by the Irish across sea. WHAT???? The Irish doing the exploiting and not the other way around? Well, "Tristan and Isolde" holds true to history in this aspect; namely, that the Celtic Britons of England were indeed pushed to the easternmost shores of the island after the coming of the Anglo-Saxons. This would, of course, have placed them in what is now Wales and Cornwall. And this is exactly where the movie is set. Let's not forget the story of Saint Patrick. Remember, he was actually a Romanized Briton who was captured and served as a slave in Ireland before escaping and ultimately returning to Ireland to convert the populace to Christianity. It's interesting to note that in the movie Christianity is a fairly new-fangled religion in Ireland, so no doubt Ridley Scott intended this to remind us of the time period at hand. 

I particulary liked "King Arthur" and "Kingdom of Heaven" despite the lukewarm reception they received from the critics. Critically speaking, "Tristan and Isolde" has been a bit of a mixed bag as well---but who really bases their decision to watch a movie on the arrogant views of movie critics? 

Rent it first if you must, but I suspect this one will be a "keeper" in your DVD library!

What really good fun!! My whole family enjoyed these Dvds to the fullest.  Really wonderful, with the feeling of Rome and a personalized view of the history.  We often travel to Italy and this was a "taste" without the trip

This movie is one of my personal favorites and probably one of rob reiners best directionals masterpeices. he hit the time, the place and the kids perfectly. this movie appealed to me as these kids were such good friends and ive never had a relationship that they all share, i find that real friendship is something worth looking for and after about 10 billoin cases of friends becoming eneimies for me... this movie really pointed out to me that its the type of relationship and the way you fell with others that makes having frineds that best thing in the world. i can only hope that i can find friends as good as these kids someday. its a great movie and i'd recommend it to anyone. you might have to look past the constant crying and deep emotions since it might seem a little fake but thats what this movie is all about.... growing up and not many kids these days are willing to share how they feel with each other which isn't as bad as it sounds. plus great script/dialog and a great tone and atomashperehope then rest of you have noticed that aswell. Its also the only movie that made me realize that i wouldnt mind living in the 1950's over this era.

       I'll start by saying all those people who think that american animated series are as good as it gets animation wise have been living under a rock since this series started 11 DVDS ago, and it continues with this volume. As for the episodes themselves, They were a good addition to the season because with the next two discs, everything comes to a head and resolves. Looking back on the four episodes, the only perceivable problem was that there was no real explanation as to why the major and batou were compelled to go to berlin with everything that was going on at home in Japan. This was not enough for a point deduction. At the end of the day, anyone who likes a good series or animation that is technically perfect shoud buy this discs and all of the discs from both seasons. You will not be disappointed.

This DVD possesses some of the best editing and production that I have yet to see in a child development product.

Each of the sections (cognitive, physical, and language) is well researched.  It's easy to understand and highly accessible.

Just as perfect for a personal library as it is for staff development

I have owned a copy of this film for a long time. I have probably watched it ten times, and I always tear up a little at each viewing. From the beginning newsreel, of a shell-shocked Diane Feinstein announcing the less than hour old murders of Harvey Milk and Mayor George Moscone, to the final reel of Harvey Milk's prophetic and haunting statements, the viewer is mesmerized. Though Harvey Milk was a San Francisco city supervisor, his election in the 1970's, that of an open and unrepentant gay man, made national headlines . He was a ray of hope to gay people everywhere, who at that time were unrepresented and, for the most part, still forced into the closet. This film not only gives insight into the philosiphy of Harvey Milk, but is a rare document into that not so long ago but seemingly ancient time. Milk was a very eloquent speaker, and his sensibility, logic, and unapologetic viewpoint more often than not made mincemeat of any verbal opponent. This is best displayed in the footage of his  debate with then California Senator Briggs, a buffoon like character, who not only was a terrible speaker, who couldn't even clearly express his arguably irrational fears, but who in fact seemed much prissier than his nemesis Milk. The public view at that time was about family values, with the Anita Bryants condeming homosexuals to Hell for their decadent ways (Old times come round again....). Milk's voice opposed this view openly, and he seemed to predict his early demise at the hands of an assassin who was against what he represented. The notion of this martyrdom, and its romantic though fateful attraction to Milk, has been argued. Nevertheless, his bravery in representing the unrepresented cannot be argued, and the sordid details of his love affairs and personal life should not diminish his message, nor the admiration he deserves. This film unfolds as it happened, seeming like fiction, but all too real. As Milk is assassinated, along with the Mayor, by the homophobic and disgruntled resigned supervisor Dan White, whose subsequent trial, with the famous "Twinkie Defense", and his being sentenced to an appalling five years for the murders, resulted in riots the likes of which the city had never seen. As one of those interviewed here expresses with sad resignation,... if only the Mayor had been killed, White would have gotten life, but the fact that Milk, a gay man, had also been killed, leaned public sympathy  towards White, an absurd but all too realistic conclusion.There are many moving, telling, historically signifigant moments in this film, but none so clearly represents those times, and Milk's loss and legacy, as the film of the nighttime march in San Francisco right after the murders. Seas of people, holding candles and standing silently, came together in a very moving moment in time. This film, which won best documentary at that years Oscars, transcends its subject matter, and is simply a great documentary. Gay rights have made much progress. And perhaps time has diminished their names and these memories to most all, excluding those who were there, are old enough to remember , or are gay.  Nonetheless, Harvey Milk is a representive and icon of the early gay rights movement, and his legacy, through schools named after him, organizations, and his place in history as a voice for the all too often voiceless, lives on.

 All of these bad reviews confuse a movie they didn't like with a badly made movie. This is a very well made movie, with perfectly competent performances. The tone is quite serious, and the ending won't cheer anyone up. But then there are many people who loved Titanic, which I found utterly depressing. More to the point, though, who cares about the problems of these rich kids? Not me. The REAL reason to watch this is to see Molly Ringwald at her most beautiful. And if you enjoy this film, check out Less Than Zero, another gloomy but solid (& underrated) '80s film. The WORST '80s film is Bright Lights, Big City - don't say I didn't warn you!

A true love-it-or-hate-it movie: my reaction fits closer with the first group.  This gritty look at the dark side of the drug culture plays like an open wound. The parallel stories chronicle a widow who descends into an addiction to diet pills, while her son tries to make a living dealing, although he, his partner, and his girlfriend smoke and snort a lot of the profits.  The director's jarring style fits the subject matter well, and Ellen Burstyn's performance as the diet pill addict is nothing short of amazing.  Julia Roberts beat her for Best Actress in 2000 with Erin Brockovich, which was a fine role and performance, but Burstyn was in another world.  Those who hate the film will complain about the style and whether the events at the end make any sense.  I can understand the second objection, hence four stars rather than five.

Note: I got this movie from Netflix--I'm not sure if I was watching the director's cut or not

The is a tragic but very true to life depiction of the degradation caused by addiction to individuals, families, and society. The film is graphic in its depiction of addiction, but as an addiction counselor, who is an addict and alcoholic in recovery, it is very close to actual tragic events I have seen in the world of addiction. The emotionally disturbing events that take place in the lives of the main characters are exactly the very real things that addiction counselors are seeking to prevent. These events are the end of untreated or unchecked addiction for far too many. Unfortunately, even though some of the content may be offensive to some, it is a starkly true depiction of what the reality for some addicts becomes. Even though the film may leave one emotionally upset for a time, it is a worthwhile film to break through false pretenses about addiction's final results and the glossing over of the degradation addiction can and does lead to in real life. Watch and learn the truth about severe addiction

They just don't have movies like this anymore.  This is not a movie that makes Charlie Sheen or Tom Berenger appeal to the young audiences who like flashy stars on sceen.  This is amovie to show you the reality of war and experiences that happened to people in the past.  

Charlie Sheen stars as a man who volutarily goes to war.  This seems odd and he figures out why everyone was looking at him so weird when he was telling them this later in the movie.  He finds out alright.  Keith David plays his friend who tries to keep his spirits up and this is definitely his best role.  He cheers him up in a great scene where they get extremely baked.  The supporting cast in this movie is unbelievable and no flat performances here.  Overall this is my favorite movie of all time.  It has stood the test of time and never fails when I want to see a good movie.  

I just have the old special edition, not the 20th anniversary but the extras are very nice.  It has a commentary from the direcotor and a seperate one from the military advisor who worked on the film.  There is also a lengthy doumentary about the making of and when I saw this I was mroe than glad I got the special edition.  You would nto believe what the actors went through!  It is a great making of.

I was introduced to the Matthew Shepard story by MTV's dramatic presentation of Matthew's last days in Laramie. With that as my background, I entered The Laramie Project with curiosity regarding the reactions of Laramie's townspeople to this tragedy that received national attention. 

Matthew was a human being, undeserving of the cruel torture that led to his death. Shameless hatred was definitely reflected by several Laramie residents, but not everyone shared that view. That fact was refreshing. The law enforcement officer who freed Matthew from the fence at the scene of the crime was incredibly sympathetic. Her personal views concerning his lifestyle were not revealed, but her view of this youth as an innocent victim of a horrific crime were apparent. Other Laramie residents were just as horrified. The so-called clergyman who brazenly expressed a heartless sentiment to one of the interviewers was expected, but equally unnerving. This film, though actors portrayed the townspeople interviewed, has the feel of a documentary. Knowing that the expressions were accurate was alarming at times. But the presentation was enlightening. 

The film addressed the fact that hate crimes are just that - crimes. No matter what a person's viewpoint, lifestyle or background, no one has a right to take on the position of punisher. Humans are not animals. Or, at least they shouldn't act like them. The Laramie Project exposes the heart of many people after the Matthew Shepard murder. It is worth the watch

Maybe it helps to be unfamiliar with Chekov's work and therefore have no preconceived notions, but I found this British made drama to be absorbing and quietly powerful in depicting the sadness and futility of pre-revolution Russia. The story of a once wealthy family slowly accepting their loss of prestige and slendor blooms like a beautiful but lonely rose, and thankfully the depths of the drama never get very sloppy, sentimental, or even tragic

This film was probably hurt a bit by the fact it had to have its fall 2001 release postponed due to 9/11(it's plot included terrorists that sell a bomb). I also imagine the marketing was tough since it had to be sold based on Tim Allen and the comparisons to "Get Shorty" rather than as a plot driven movie. I tell you though, this film is simply funny. 

Just like an old Marx Brothers film, the plot is there only to set in motion the quick-witted dialogue and interaction between the characters. I have enjoyed both of Dave Barry's humor novels(this and "Tricky Business"). They made me laugh out loud as did this movie. I think it captures the spirit of the book perfectly.  For those that have laughed at Dennis Farina from his roles in "Get Shorty and even "Snatch,"  he has never been funnier as a hit man who encounters unexpected roadblocks(literally) on his trip to do a quick sniper job.  Tom Sizemore is also excellent as the dumbest crook you'll ever see. 

There are some movies that you may see once in the theaters yet can watch over and over everytime it is on tv because it retains the ability to always make you laugh, no matter how many times you have seen it. 

Check this one out!

well, Season 5 for me was a little bit of a dissappointment but still contain the character plot line (or the theme as many will call it) of Southpark itself.  Since buying this i watched it alot in the first month or two then dropped off.   My interest in Southpark was revisited with Season 6 (also available on DVD)  However,  If you like South Park or love it this is for you of course without saying.  However, If you just joining in you might want to get the package with the first 5 seasons all together, but this season was good

This 1971 black comedy is still a stitch, even if it doesn't feel as audacious as I'm sure it once did. Directed by the maverick Hal Ashby, it is the epitome of all opposites-attract love stories as a twenty-year old depressive connects with a 79-year old life-loving woman. They actually bond over their mutual interest in death, as they keep showing up at the same funerals. However, the root of their respective interests couldn't be more different - Maude shows up to reconfirm how lucky she feels to be alive, while the hearse-driving Harold simply likes the morbidity of it all.

The plot is really about their burgeoning relationship, while his mother constantly attempts to make the death-obsessed Harold more socially acceptable. First, she uselessly sets him up on a series of blind dates. To foil any hope of romance with these women, however, he stages mock-suicides which simply perturbs rather than disturbs his mother. She then recruits an ineffectual analyst and even has her brother Victor, a hawkish officer and Vietnam War amputee, to try to convince Harold to join the Army. The episodic structure of the story by Collin Higgins (years before becoming a director in his own right with "Foul Play" and "Nine to Five") allows the characters to develop in subtle ways with a completely deadpan approach despite the outward shenanigans of the characters' actions. The movie eventually moves toward a greater gravitas but despite some soap opera elements, surprisingly not at the expense of the pervasive whimsical tone.

Ruth Gordon is her typically pixilated self, an archetype she played for years afterward, while Bud Cort is terrific in conveying his particular brand of wide-eyed cynicism. It's really their unforced chemistry that keeps the film feeling fresh 35 years later. There are funny sideline performances by Vivian Pickles as Harold's eye-rolling mother, Ellen Geer as an overly actressy blind date named Sunshine, and Eric Christmas in a very funny cameo as a disapproving priest. Cat Stevens' soundtrack hasn't aged as well as, say, Simon and Garfunkel's music in "The Graduate", but it still works as a folkish commentary on the quirky proceedings. Unfortunately, the 2000 DVD contains a rather compromised print and there are no extras included

Truly frightening, gruesome, a gore-fest, a bloodbath, AND it has a plot... really, there are a lot of clichï¿½ expressions to describe this movie but they're all true: It's a HORROR movie in the true sense of the word.

I hadn't seen a Rob Zombie movie before this one, but I would have to say, after seeing it, that it's got to be his masterpiece. I don't see how he could top it. "House of 1000 Corpses" is NOT a movie that people who don't like the genre should be watching. I don't think they'd be able to stomach it. It's a downward spiral of evil, depredation, degradation and mayhem out of an imagination that must be really SICK (but awesome). The sense of humor in the movie actually doesn't spoil it, it just makes it better, it's so malicious. The atmosphere, the acting, the special effects and makeup, everything contributes to an hour-and-a-half long ride through a freak show that shouldn't be missed by true horror-movie buffs. Buy it, rent it, whatever. If you love being scared, you'll love this movie. It delivers!

</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
I saw this movie in theaters probably when it first came out in 2001, but I didn't pay too close attention, because I forgot about it. However, I remembered seeing it in theaters one day when I was browsing the DVD section, and decided to give it another shot at home. I am so glad I did! Leelee Sobieski is absolutely gourgeous and did a flawless job with the film. She has a bright future in acting ahead of her. Basically what happens is, Ruby (Sobieski) and her brother Rhett's (Trevor Morgan) parents die in a car accident. Their parents wished for them to go live with the family's former neighbors, the Glasses, (who had since moved to Malibu) played by Stellan Skarsgard and Diane Lane. Needless to say, Ruby and Rhett's carefree lives are changed dramatically. Rhett falls for all the gifts that the Glasses buy for him, but Ruby isn't fooled so easily. She begins to suspect that her parents' death wasn't an accident, and starts to investigate. She sees certain things and observes certain behaviors exhibited by the Glasses that only make her more suspicious. Eventually, she figures out that the Glasses are behind the car accident and are now after Ruby and Rhett's 4 million dollar fortune that was left to them by their parents. I won't give away the rest, but the movie takes you on a roller coaster ride of excitement and suspense that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the last second! Rent it, or better yet, buy it! It's well worth your while!

This is a fine collection for those who have recently discovered early REM as well as those who own REM's previous IRS years video collection: Succumbs.  The Succumbs videos are all here, with some variation, and the additional videos/footage are excellent.  Very serious fans will want more, but this is better than nothing and worth the price.
If you like early REM then you may like:

At last!  A full-length Jimmy Buffett concert on DVD!  It's been a while coming but this is a beauty.  There are so many highlights it's hard to know where to start - perhaps the best place is the overall quality of the DVD.  The sound is superb, the camera-work spot on and the real essence of a Jimmy Buffett concert is captured perfectly.  The song mix is terrific - everything from Buffett classics like Volcano, to new classic like Piece Of Work, to iconic covers like Southern Cross.  Seeing Jimmy and the Coral Reefers perform in daylight and night-time is a nice touch and the crowd shots show why a Buffett concert is such an all-encompassing experience!  For me, a favourite moment is the concert finale of Steve Goodman's City Of New Orleans.  Steve now resides under home plate at Wrigley and I'm sure he was singing along as well.  Buffett fans and new Parrotheads alike will find this DVD one to watch many times over

Georges Seurat was totally insane by the age of 32.  Knowing that helps Stephen Sondheim's genius show through. Sunday in the Park with George is an amazing show about the life of this manic artist, and the fictional personalities of the figures in his painting "A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte". The first Act is completely devoted to a set of Sundays spanning 2 years of Seurat's life and the end of his relationship with a long-time lover. The dramatic and touching songs make you feel for this hard-nosed painter yet comical points shine through. The second act takes place 100 years later in 1984 with the Great-grandson of Georges (also played by Mandy Patinkin) doing a tribute to the painting that brought his relative so much posthumous fame. Like other Sondheim shows it is at times long-winded, but altogether entirely enjoyable. Mandy and Mrs. Peters' voice have so much emotion and power that, with the correct sound system, you are carried to the brink of pure delight and insanity by their performances. With Commentary from the actors and producers this is an essential for one who collects musicals

Having drooled over the Goodtimes dvd for years now, I did a flip and a half when I saw Universal was releasing a widescreen dvd of this superhot love story. I refrained from doing two flips when I remembered it was Universal and then saw no mention of special features. What? Look at the potential for bonuses! There was an alternate ending, there were deleted scenes, how about a featurette?! Argh! I just wept and wept. And then months later the release date comes, I tear the dvd open and the movie starts automatically - I hit menu and get the nagging old "operation prohibited by disc" usually reserved for fast forwarding through those tired old FBI warnings. There's not even a menu! No scene selection. Geez. Do these corporate monoliths now require movies to be no older than 5 days old to have simple menus? I'd like to sit down and analyze the brilliance of Sarandon and Spader, note how Spader's hair changes near the end because of reshoots, but I'm just too raving mad at Universal right now.

I'll start out by saying that I prefer the Jason movies.  I think the whole body count is a fun way to watch a horror movie.  The Freddy movies are good horror movies, but they're not really slashers like I thought they would be.

 - A Nightmare on Elm Street - 

A great, classic horror movie by Wes Craven.  He creates good high school characters, although trying to prove that they're only 15 years old is a little far-fetched.  Freddy is more horrific and scary, he doesn't say much.

- A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge - 

They were asking for it when they completely changed the style and rules of Freddy in this sequel.  Many will disagree, but I don't think it's a bad movie, it's just very dark and horrific.

- A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors - 

Definately a step up from Part 2.  It goes back to the roots of the original film and brings back Nancy, who is now studying dreams and sleep in a mental hospital.  The style brings us back to the original movie with the same rules and objectives.

- A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master - 

Decent entry in the series carrying over characters from #3 and introducing all new characters.  The story doesn't flow as easily this time around and it's a step down from Part 3, but still good.

- A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child -

Stephen Hopkins' visual style makes this the best sequel in the series.  Freddy is hilarious and the special effects are great.  The story is more interesting than Part 4 and the characters have matured since that movie which is good.

- Freddy's Dead - The Final Nightmare - 

Cheesy storyline trying to tell us that in 10 years there will be no kids left in an American town?  Rachel Talalay thinks the 3-D effects in the film are lame, but not that story element?  If it weren't for the interesting backstory on Freddy, this wouldn't be a good movie.

- Wes Craven's New Nightare - 

Wes Craven did succeed in making an interesting and well made horror movie here, but it is a little strange to include it in the rest of the series.  Better watched on its own and not consecutively with the other movies.

- Nightmare Encyclopedia - 

Alot of interviews that aren't edited very interestingly make for a decent special features disk.  It's good to see that these interview aren't self serving at all and they're completely retrospective, it would've been nice to hear more from Heather Langenkamp, or possibly Johnny Depp?

This is a great set for extreme fans and a good set for casual fans.  I'm a huge fan of the Alien series and a pretty big fan of the Predator series, but not as much as Alien.  I would say that I'm now a huge fan of Jason and a good sized fan of Freddy in comparison to Alien/Predator.  I do recommend these movies, but this enormous box with annoying cardboard cases is outdated for today

For a plot synopsis please read the Amazon review. I wish to talk about the reasons why you will love this film.

As a longtime fan of both Sam Raimi (of the Evil Dead series) and Bill Paxton (Aliens, Twister), I went to see this on opening night. Not many people can claim this I'm sure because it was and is, such a small film that received next to no marketing. For shame.

This film is in the best tradition of modern film noir including BLOOD SIMPLE and FARGO, both made by the Cohen brothers. Film buffs will be able to draw the connections to those films and their filmakers, so I won't bother to get into that. Should you have seen either of these films and enjoyed them, I suggest you stop reading and immediately rent A SIMPLE PLAN. If not, keep reading and I will try to express why this film is so remarkably brilliant. And why I hope you will take a look at it.

A SIMPLE PLAN is, at its core, about four people. And underneath all the plot devices and twists, it's about how they relate to one another. Notice I did't say characters, because this film doesn't have actors simply delivering dialogue. It's about people you get to know, understand and sympathise with as they undergo the most brutal of dilemmas. Sure, finding a mysterious bag filled with money is an excellent plot device, but the heart of this film is much simpler than that. It's about the basic human flaw of committing a criminal act and trying to weasel your way out of it. And being forced to do the most unthinkable things in the process.

That's what gives this film such depth. You watch these people try to figure out how to cover every angle so they can get away with stealing a whole lot of cash. And in the end it falls apart for two reasons: the details and the human factor. They say the Devil is in the details and this is never truer than with a crime. As for the human factor, where greed is concerned, people cannot trust one another because they fear the other person's greed while are unable satisfy their own.

In many respects this film is almost an homage to BLOOD SIMPLE and FARGO, but in many ways I think it is superior. I often draw the comparison by a scene which is both A SIMPLE PLAN and BLOOD SIMPLE where a body is increasingly difficult to dispose of. And even afterwards, after the emotional toll the has been taken, once one evil act is committed, another is sure to follow. It's so painfully facsinating to watch a person work out their problem on camera, frantically going over the details in their mind, all the while their heart is beating a mile a minute. Bill Paxton does this better than anyone. He is such a likable man (both in the film and in life) that you can't help but feel sorry for the mess he has created. His entire performance is a balancing act between getting away with a seemingly harmless crime, keeping his partners at bay and their mouths shut while being prodded along by his conspirator wife. That may make them all sound malicious, but really the opposite is actually true. They're all normal folks, like we've all seen a hundred times. And in the end it really gets to you because you can imagine how you would react in the same situations they find themselves in. 

After all, were you faced with the choice to steal a couple million dollars that no one would miss, what would you do? 
But then again, nothing is ever that simple

My brother is Cameron Fry and it wasn't until his first year in college that he found his Ferris Bueller.  This is a classic that every high school student should see.  It's a great way to appreciate life and the parade scene is one of the best.  It's easy to tell from this film that Matthew Broderick was destined to be a star

The Firms "Super Body Sculpt" is a 40 mins, 3 parts workout which is broken up into Upper Body, Lower Body, and Abs.  Each segment has its own warmup and cool down. It can be performed one segment at a time, or all together for a complete total body workout.  The Upper Body flies by quickly with pushups, lat rows and french presses and biceps.  The Lower Body section focuses a little too much on Squats, and by the end of your last leg press exercise, there are more squats  that will make you want to scream "Enough".  I found the Abs section too short and not enough emphasis on crunches, and too much on obliques.  The stablization exercises are a great bonus to this DVD, and are my favourite.  Overall it is very well instructed.  You can pyramid up the weights if you are strong enough, especcially during leg presses and squats.  I usually do all three segments to get the full benefits I need, and this DVD is great as a beginners tool to a firm body

i just wanted to say this is a great workout. i love the eastern dance styles. i have just written a long review of honey's bollywood workout,and people were saying the same things, too fast etc...but indian dance is taught by imitation, and is very expressive facially and bodily(especially the classical dances) and open to improv. bollywood and bhangra are an extension of classical. most don't realize eastern dance is learned and practiced in a vigorous manner imitating, learning, and memorizing from the beginning. the teachers of the classical and indian dances do not like to break up the steps and movement or slow them unless they are so, because you lose the inspiration and the feeling of whatever you may be portraying. so have fun with this, it's awesome and leaves room for your own interpretation of things as mentioned. and it really wears you out. plus everyone looks great dancing and celebrating the movement and abilities of the body no matter the dance form! but i find eastern to be the most passionate, feminine, beautiful, and divine. have fun

Haven't we all been there? Wishing we could be better than someone else? Wishing that we had our turn in the spotlight? This is exactly how the movie "Cheaters" affected me. I found it truly amazing that this movie was made on a true story like this. The plot is really incredible and actually makes you ponder the question "What would I do in this situation?" Jeff Daniels and Jena Malone give such incredible performances in this movie. I believe that they are very convincing. If you are in the mood to be emotionally touched by a movie, "Cheaters" is the true direction for you to head in

This is my favorite toning workout and I'm sure to incorporate it into my routine for my once a week tone-fest. What I like best about it is that I can customize it to whatever body part I think needs the most work this week. Need a 30 minute ab workout? You can choose it. Think the arms and legs need work? No problem. Want to tone a little bit of everything? You can do that, too.

The instructors are all good - clear, not irritating, and they come up with some unique exercises to work each body part - it's not your standard crunches for ab work on this video. 

This was one of my best purchases, workout-wise. I wish there were more DVD's/workouts out there with Minna Lessig - she is my favorite instructor (she does the arm/leg workouts on this DVD). The other two instructors are wonderful as well - and the workout just seems to fly by, although at the end you do know you've worked those muscle groups.

Absolutely one of the best movies I have ever seen.  I saw it first in 1995 on video, I believe.  Never saw it or heard of it on the big screen.  Anyway, it's proof positive that a great directorial job, with actors (human and animal) who believe in a story about real human failings, lightheartedness and heroics can turn a pretty good screenplay with wonderfully charming dogs into one with a real impact on your life.  I had to see it again a couple of years later just to make sure it was as good as I thought. It deals with real suffering (including death, revenge, and anger) and then redemption.  Don't look for the classic happy ending, but an ending which is consistent with the themes in the movie and is very satisfying, after a little thought. The movie completely pulls you in (without your realizing it) and works its magic on your mind.  But, don't expect it to be powerful though you will notice tears forming frequently throughout the movie, often unexplained at first.  "Fluke" also seemed to leave me a little wiser and more understanding and compassionate toward my family, especially. I sort of got it the next day! And, you will love "Fluke", the dog! The movie is about a dog, but it's really about so much more. Even though the dog scenes are great, the subject matter at times is rather charged and there is violence and death (human and animal), so please be prepared to talk about it with your kids if they watch it with you

I heard so much about Masaki Kobayashi's "Harakiri", so I bought it at Amazon and watched it.  Wow, this movie is awesome!!  Now I don't know who is my #1 favorite director, Akira Kurosawa or Masaki Kobayashi. This black and white movie intensifies the theme of this movie along with the music by Tohru Takemitsu.  In addition to these assets, the camera is wonderful.  I pick this movie as one of "my movies of my life".  Tatuyua Nakadai was shining in this movie.  I like him more after seeing "Harakiri".

The thesis of Guns, Germs and Steel gives the most logical explanation for the inequality in development in the world today. Not based on one group of people being inherently smarter than other groups, but based on a group of people favored by their environment and other factors.....very interesting theory that should be given more study.

Hi Folks,

the movies all look very good..and there are a nice group  of bonus features from vintage featurettes to  commentaries!  On  Macao...I particularly enjoyed the 30 minute interview with Jane Russell and  Robert Mitchum  that Robert Osborne conducted...very late in the life of Mr Mitchum.  The packaging it great and frankly 6 films from the great Robert Mitchum at under $10 each on DVD w/bonus features is a terrrrrifffic deal!

The movies aren't generally considered Mitchum's best or best known but when you consider you've got Jean Simmons as a costar and Otto Preminger directing Angel Face,  Josef Von  Sternberg helming  Macao, Vincent Minnelli directing HOme From The Hill, The great Fred Zinneman directing and the legend Deborah Kerr co-starring in the Sundowners ...you can figure this isn't the bottom of  the barrel either!  Oh and Sydney Pollack directed The Yakuza and contributes a great commentary....

To  sum up...warner Bros...continues to deliver THE VERY BEST classic titles on  DVD with the best combination of quality transfers/bonus features and value packages!!!!

I like this movie a lot - not just because it is made by Visconti (one of the greatest cinematic figures of the 20th century) or because of its cast (Dirk Bogarde and Helmut Griem are always good) - no, I think it is the way the film attempts to look at a bigger picture through the corruption that surrounds a wealthy family that makes this film so interesting.
You can see elements of this style in other Visconti films like the Leopard, in Coppola's Godfather trilogy, and in Fassbinder's Maria Braun.  Now to speak of Visconti's visual genius - Has there ever been a director who could sustain a scene in such a virtuosic way as in the nazi 'party' scene midway through the film - Or again in 'Death in Venice' - with the scenes on the beach. Anyway enough of my babble - just see the films of Visconti - and you will see what I mean

I saw this back in 1985 when if first came out.  It was wonderful.  At first, I thought it was going to be one of those historical/tourist shows.  But it wasn't.  It could have been, though.  
Mr. Wood is a very charismatic presenter.  But is what's better is that he took the story of the story of the Trojan War from the pages of modern myth to reality.  I have read Homer and I knew about Schlieman, but other than that, I was ignorant of the Trojan War.
Mr. Wood started with what a regular person knew about the war and then took it into deeper level.  I was fascinated by the connection he made to the Hittite Empire.  The thought had never occurred to me that if a Troy did exist, it might have trade relations with empires to the east.  He also included experts in the fields of archeology, modern history and history of the period.
I thouroughly enjoyed the dvd and have seen it several times.  I also have the Alexander dvd and Shakepeare.  "In Search of Shakespeare", was fun.  Wood took the story of Shakespeare down to the center of his human story.

I would recommend all the Wood "In Search of..." programs.  If you can't find the films, then read the books.  The books are just are entertaining.

By winning their third title in four years the same year that the baseball team that defines the hopes and dreams of generations of New Englanders wins its first World Series in 86 years.

It's true, the Patriots somehow pieced together a team that, despite a string of injuries that seemed to defy all rationality and managed to finish a second consecutive campaign as Super Bowl champions with a 17-2 record (which just as easily could have/should have been 18-1)...but the 2004 Boston Red Sox completely sucked the oxygen out of the American Sports atmosphere and somehow the 2004 Patriots season just doesn't seem to measure up to the previous title years of 2001 and 2003.  Part of the reason is that the previous years seemed to have their own personalities (2001 having 9/11, the coming-of-age of Tom Brady, the Snow Bowl, and the unbelievable finish of what was probably the most exciting Super Bowl ever.  2003 had the release of Lawyer Milloy, the early stumbles to Buffalo and Washington, the birth of the winning streak, winter weather in Foxboro, and yet another thrilling Super Bowl finish); 2004 just seemed like an anticlimax by comparison, like you were watching a scripted performance that was always going to end with the "W" on the Patriots' side of the field.

This is not to say that there were not intriguing challenges that made for good storytelling...the injuries (leading to the incredible "throwback" two-way play of veteran Wide Receiver/rookie Cornerback Troy Brown), the continued winning streak, the rebirth of offseason acquisition Corey Dillon, the continuing mastery of the Indianapolis Colts, and the return to Pittsburgh (where the record 21-game winning streak came to an emphatic end on Halloween (just days after the Red Sox won the World Series, karmically enough), where University of Michigan graduate Tom Brady resurrected himself from a triple-digit fever the night before to thoroughly dismantle the best regarded defense in the NFL to send the Patriots back to the Super Bowl, this time in the unfairly maligned city of Jacksonville, FL.

No nail-biting endings this time, though...despite the best efforts of Terrell Owens to come back from a leg and ankle injury that would have ended the season of anyone else (with the possible exception of Curt Schilling, of course), the Eagles All-Pro was clearly the second-best receiver on the field as Deion Branch won the Super Bowl MVP for a record day (Safetyman and Render Of Mayhem Extraordinaire Rodney Harrison would have been my pick, actually) and the Patriots, though trailing early, never really seemed in doubt of winning a game they led by 10 points late before prevailing by the final score of 24-21 which in truth flattered the Eagles more than they deserved.

Far be it that a season ending with a record of 17-2 and another Super Bowl ring should be considered hum-drum, but there was something missing from the 2004 campaign that, impressive as it was, just doesn't translate to the memorable re-telling that the Pats' previous title years do.  This is a great DVD for Pats fans, indispensible even, but for the casual fan who appreciates the drama that a good NFL season can bring, I would recommend either of the previous Patriots highlights DVD's over this one

Ohm... Ohm... Ohm...

Back in 2000, Ellipsis Arts released OHM: The Early Gurus of Electronic Music, a fantastic and essential three CD set tracing the evolution of "electronica" from Messiaen, Cage, and Xenakis to Schulze, Eno, and Hassell. This set was recently reissued (as OHM+) along with a bonus DVD, which is thankfully now available separately for those of us who already have the CDs.

The OHM+ DVD is jam-packed with over two hours of archival and more recent footage that runs the gamut from engrossing to mildly interesting to unwatchably dull.

If seemingly endless "talking head" interviews with Milton Babbitt and Bebe Barron are your idea of video entertainment, you've come to the right place. An interview with John Cage digitally altered beyond all recognition? Check. Swirling psychadelic colored dyes right out of a Saucerful of Secrets-era Pink Floyd concert? No problem.

There are some tastier goodies to be found on this DVD, however...

The segments with Clara Rockmore and Leon Theremin have an appealingly amateurish home movie quality to them. It's also a real treat to see the 1978 footage of underappreciated minimalist guru David Borden and Mother Mallard's Portable Masterpiece Company "on the road" hauling around their truckload of big old analog synthesizer equipment. Laurie Spiegel is fun to watch as she tinkers with a big grey metal box called a "Concerto Generator" with an extremely serious expression on her face. And Alvin Lucier's "Music for Solo Performer," where he hooks up wires to his head and produces sounds using his brainwaves and two tympani, simply must be seen to be believed.

The Pixar-ish computer animation accompanying Paul Lansky's "The Dust Bunny" is sort of cute, but it goes on for about 10 minutes too long. Surely most of the OHM target audience already has the DVD of Steve Reich's Three Tales, but it's nice that they included the best part - the ominous yet goofy "Dolly" segment. Many have also probably seen Hans Fjellestad's documentary Moog before, but the six minute excerpt provided here is really about all you need.

It's too bad there isn't a more interesting John Cage segment, and regrettable that there aren't any Stockhausen videos (those would certainly be a riot!)

Overall, though, while the OHM+ DVD is not as consistently engaging as the CD set of the same name, it is a worthy companion to it. And if you don't have either of them yet, the complete OHM+ 3-CD & DVD "special edition" box set is a no-brainer

Notice to parents, there is some verbal material unsuited for little ones,  adult nature. A woman grows to 50-ft placing an extra strain on a strained  marriage. Daryl Hanna and Daniel Baldwin. This is a light monster film not  gory. It is good for that it carries some laughs, punny stuff, and summer  flick character. No deep story, folks

Crackerjack courtroom trial drama based on a true story of three Australian soldiers in the Boer War accused of killing prisoners and a Dutch minister. The British command is obviously using the three as scapegoats to convince the Germans, who seem eager to join the war on the side of the Boers, to stay out. The men claim they were only following orders, orders which went against "normal" military practice. This is a new type of warfare: the Boers fought as guerrillas, not in uniform, not by "the rules." The Australians on trial felt they were engaging them on those terms. The morality of war itself, therefore, is just as much on trial as these men. They all lose in the end. The trial scenes are well paced, and the use of flashback creates just the right amount of tension. Also there are enough shady gray areas to keep the proceedings interesting. Well worth a watch

Supposed being victimized by local communist regime and Soviet oppressors since August-1968, a skilled surgeon changed countries and jobs like  surgical gloves he did at hospitals.

No wonder, sex is a fix for such a lucky, and marriage to a beautiful adorable woman stopped a character with Southern European rather than Slavic appearance a little.

Extended up to 165 minutes of screening, romantic tale with some near-porno inclusions is a bit more over-positive and over-entertaining than its final collapsed in.

Well, movie spirit seems being similar to "A Beautiful Life", "Producers" or, more recent one of Levi's Hitler-as-a-comedy-hero, of what optimism and humoristic style used to depicting the tragedy serve well cinemagoers seeking a relaxation only.

Ok, first of all Oct Fri the 13th I FINALLY saw this movie in 3D, sigh I can die happy! Ok this one is really pretty awesome. Chris plays a great leading girl (the only F-13 leadI didnt want to see with an axe in her skull). The other characters are pretty harmless too. Wev'e got bikers (snort), pothead hippies, a fro'd chubster and a dude who can walks on his hands better than he can act. Plus this came out in the early 80's so the ratings board didnt demolish all the awesome gore scenes. I give this one a high-5! Cool deaths, funny scenes and aside from Chris's sherbert pants, some decent 80's fashion too. Yo Debbie, I want your bikini, too cuuute.

Expect a liberal dose of everything you generally do from a martial arts flick -- slapstick comedy, overly melodramatic subplotting, and, on occasion, even a hint of a story. 

All that aside (which is how I am sure the director saw it) the balletic, intricate and often incredible stunt work during the action scenes is an absolute treat. Jet Li's utter disregard for human limits is evident as he turns in a surprisingly measured yet kinetic performance, nothing like his forgettable Hollywood yawns.  

The subtitles for this Mandarin-language effort are a bit difficult to read, since the English is in small print below the more prominent Chinese subtitles. But when the action kicks into gear, forget them and just watch the graceful choreography of the fight scenes.

Notably notable in the three installments: 

PART-I:  
A mind-blowing hook-and-ladder battle, plus a terrific umbrella sequence.

PART-II: 
The climactic fight with Donnie Yen. The speed and technique shown during the double-pole fight is staggering; Yen's moves with his cloth staff left me gob-smacked. 

PART-III: 
This one clearly suffers and is even borderline skippable. The final fight scene at the lion-dance competition is a colorful pageant, but lacks the impact of the one-on-one fights in the first two films, mainly because the participants are all wearing giant lion head masks.


All in all, can't go Wong with this purchase.

Okay, after reading several reviews, I decided to buy this anyway for a few laughs.  Boy did I get my moneys worth!  It was so incredibly BAD that I was first cringing in horror before I started laughing.  The characters, especially Hiei, were so screwed up and the voice dubbing was so unfamiliar that in the end it had me laughing.  

Now, I'm a die hard yyh fan, but I give it high marks just because it was so much fun to watch.  Put me in a good mood for the rest of the day.  If you arent pressed for cash and up for a few laughs i'd definitely suggest  buying for th he11 of it

This review refers to "Excalibur"(DVD-Region 2) 
  
In days of old, with knights so bold, and fair maidens glittering all in gold, lays the legend of King Arthur, Camelot, and the powerful, mystical sword known as "Excalibur". John Boorman's beautiful artistic film (adopted from Sir Arthur Mallory's "Le Morte D'Arthur"),will captivate you and take you away to another time and place. From the birth of Arthur, Merlin taking him away for 20 years, Arthur drawing "Excalibur" from the stone, the emergence of Camelot,the magical powers of Merlin and the evil Morgana, to Arthur's demise and being taken off to Avalon, the beauty of this film and this story will have you under a spell. 
  
The European cast and the exquisite location shoots in the country side of Ireland add a sense of authenticity to the flavor of this film. King Arthur, The Knights of the Round Table,Sir Lancelot, Guinevere, Merlin, Morgana, Sir Gawain, Percival, Uther, they're all very much part of the story, and the cast is tremendous. Nigel Terry is the good and noble King Arthur, Lancelot and Guinevere, who loved their King but also each other are played by Nicholas Clay and Cherie Lunghi. You'll see stellar performances by a young Gabriel Bryne(in his first feature film), Patrick Stewart, and Liam Neeson. Helen Mirren is excellent as the evil Morgana, and the always wonderful Nicol Williamson is the magical mystical Merlin 
  
This edition is for viewers with DVD players compatible with Region 2(Japan, Europe, South Africa, and the Middle East, including Egypt ).Some players are multi-regional, so check your manual. 
  
Parents...although a wonderful tale of knights and fair ladies, this is NOT one for younger viewers. The battle scenes are violent and a bit graphic and there are also some sexual situations. "First Knight" with Richard Gere and Sean Connery, although not quite as true to the legend, is rated PG-13, is quite an entertaining film, and may be more suitable for family viewing(there is some violence). 
  
A beautiful story and film. Enjoy....Lauri

This film is a must-see for any dancer.  The clips used to showcase different types of dancing in film are creatively woven together and the commentary is very informative.  Many famous scenes from the old MGM  musicals to the water spray scene in Flashdance are used to illustrate how  diversified dancing in films can be.  For ballet dancers, there is a  portion devoted solely to ballet in films which is hosted by Mikhail  Baryshnikov.  Scenes of Rudolph Nureyev leaping through the air compliment  this section as well as scenes from various ballets.  Liza Minelli hosts  the Broadway inspirational portion which is shorter in length.  I only saw  this film once but I feel that it is a must-own selection for any dancer

This workout is nice because it doesn't mess around.  There are no long introductions you can't fast-forward through and the workout itself is challenging both the abdominal and breath series and the side series (which is all legs and hips) are really challenging and I plan on doing them to keep my muscles toned even after delivery.  One complaint is that apparently she releases the videos herself and they aren't available very widespread in retail stores.  I also would have liked it if they had included more arm work or a postnatal workout.  All in all though great

My first viewing of this film was a great disappointment.  I expected another Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy film, with Chevalier substituting for Eddy.  And I emphatically did not like the film.  Then I viewed the film a second time, this time with the play-by-play voice-over analysis by Miles Kreuger, which comes as a extra bonus on this DVD.  Suddenly I was seeing the film in a completely different light, and absolutely loving this film.  This DVD is an absolute gem, and one of the best things about it is the intelligent and articulate insights provided by Miles Kreuger, not confined to this film alone but applying to the cinema world at large in the early 30s.  It is as if a film critic from the 1930s had come back to life, as if he had actually been on the sets during the filming (because he's talked to those who were).  Kreuger's commentary alone is worth the price of this DVD.  After seeing this film for the first time, you must go back and see it again through Miles Kreuger's eyes.

My husband received this DVD for his birthday. My husband grew up with the Pittsburg Steelers and still today is a true fan. As a family we all sat and watched this wonderful DVD on the Steelers and all of us enjoyed it very much. It goes back to the begining of time for the Steelers, it shows the superbowls and how the steel curtin got it's name. If you love the steelers then this 2 DVD set is a must have. You will not be disappointed

While it is certainly fun to watch just to see the performers,this HISTORY OF ROCK simply doesn't jell as a whole.By trying to explain the evolution of the music,the pleasure gets lost along the way.If you are a rock connaisseur,you won't learn many new things if you watch this.What you should do is take it as a starter point and then go further with documents who gets deeper with one particular field(ex:MOTOWN or BRITISH INVASION).As it is,it tries to cover too much ground at once and still manages to forget a few artists like EMERSON,LAKE AND PALMER and KING CRIMSON among others.It costs me $80 dollars (CANADIAN money)for this 5 dvd set, which is too much for what it's worth.Rent it and enjoy the clips

This is definitely the best Ab workout. Working in a desk job,I kept gaining weight around the Ab area. 

After just two days of this DVD, I had results. It was incredible. The fat around my abs just kept shrinking and
shrinking. 

I would recomend this to anybody. No matter how fit you are,
there are four levels of difficulty. Practically anybody can
do the first level. I do all four. Already I am seeing results.

I hope he puts out more videos for upper body strength as well.

Cannot stress how fast the results are. You will probably see results within a week

You can tell your life is REALLY pathetic when ghosts have to show you how to live.

But that is what happens to Cosmo Topper, in the charming "Topper" and its equally charming sequel "Topper Returns."  It's basically your typical screwball comedy (complete with Cary Grant), but with an injection of supernatural pranking and murder mystery. In other words, it's loads of fun.

George and Marion Kirby (Cary Grant, Constance Bennett) love fun, partying until clubs kick them out, and generally not taking life seriously. So it's a shock to them when they die in a car accident, and linger on as ghosts. Apparently they have not done any good deeds to go to the Great Beyond.

So when George's boss, Cosmo Topper (Roland Young), crashes his new car in the same spot, the Kirbys take him under their wing. Poor Cosmo is stodgy and timid, with a domineering wife who schedules his day down to the minute. So it's up to the Kirbys to show the poor man how to live life and have fun, but their good deed rapidly gets away from them...

And most sequels stink, but goofy murder mystery "Topper Returns" is just as funny as the first movie. Instead of a ghostly screwball, this time it's a spoof of "haunted house" stories, with a nod to Hitchcock's "Rebecca."

Ann Carrington (Carole Landis) is returning to her ancestral home and inheritance, with cheeky pal Gail (Joan Blondell) in tow. But after the girls switch bedrooms, someone murders Gail. Confused, she drifts over to the house of Cosmo Topper (Roland Young), whose car she hijacked earlier in the day.

Gail blackmails Topper into helping her discover who murdered her, and who is trying to kill Ann. Now the unfortunate Topper must somehow solve the mystery, despite a small army of creepy servants, a house full of secret passages and vicious seals, and his upset wife searching high and low for him...

Based on Thorne Smith's novels, "Topper" and "Topper Returns" even had a spinoff TV series, which was nowhere near as good as the movies. And those movies are charming and still fresh, especially if you like to see a twist on the usual ghost stories.

But it's the little touches that make this movie hilarious; for example, there's George laughing on a chandelier, and Gail chugging champagne when she discovers her own dead body. Not to mention that vicious seal. The comedy becomes more obvious and spoofy in the second film, but no less entertaining. 

But at the same time, these movies are graced by tender moments between George and Marion, and a truly exquisite scene where Gail's ghost wanders out the window into the sky. And I'm still not sure how that invisible-person-under-the-covers shot was done, especially with the primitive special effects of the 1940s. 

Roland Young is the star of the piece -- his Topper is timid, halting, and has his day scheduled down to the minute. Not a single spark of sponteneity. Grant comes across like a trickster god, and has wonderful chemistry with Bennett. And Blondell is simply charming as a resourcefully cheeky ghost girl.

"Topper" and "Topper Returns" are decades old, but are perfect examples of Hollywood classics. Charming, chipper and hilarious

I do not consider it hyperbole to talk about the second season of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" as scaling operatic heights, culminating with the glorious aria of "Becoming, Part 2," which I still relentlesly tout as one of the ten best dramatic hours on television I have ever seen in my life. I have watched a lot of television and have been teaching classes about this topic for over half my life, so I believe I can make a pretty convincing case. We witnesses the potential of this series in Season 1, when creator Joss Whedon held off on the revelation that the mysterious Angel was really a vampire, who just happened to have a soul and loved the Slayer, until half way through the abbreviated first season. In Season 2, we find out just how far true love can go wrong.

Love continues to be a very painful thing for the Scooby Gang, as Cordelia ("Some Assembly Required"), Xander ("Inca Mummy Girl") and Joyce ("Ted"), find out. Then again, prospects look much better for Willow ("Phases"), although we never really do take the Cordelia-Xander romance ("Go Fish") to be anything more than a cosmic joke, which does offer up the delightfully twisted "Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered" as the exception that proves the rule (footnote: Buffy spends most of the episode as the Buffy rat because Sarah Michelle Gellar was hosting SNL that week). Of the off-arc stories, "Halloween" and "Ted" are clearly the best of the bunch. But when it comes to romance, Buffy and Angel are truly on the road to hell paved with the best of intentions.

It is clear in the season premier episode, "When She Was Bad," that things are different. When Buffy dances seductively with Xander, taunting him with her sexuality, the ante has been upped considerably. The pivotal point in the season comes with episode 13 (of 22), "Surprise," when Buffy unknowingly undoes Angel's curse on the night of her 17th birthday by making love to him. Why the gypsies put in the Faustian (in the Goethe sense) escape clause via the moment of true happiness and contentment is debatable, but the galvanizing effect on the show is truly impressive. When Angelus brutally slays Jenny Calendar in "Passion," leaving her body in a grotesque display for Giles to discover in his bed (while opera music soars in the background), it is the symbolic Hellmouth of the show opening up. The audience is shocked into realizing how bad things can get, only the worst is yet to come. Giles's anger buys him one shot at Angelus, but Buffy has to rescue him. They turn on each other in anger, and Buffy actually slugs him to the ground before they collapse weeping in each other's arms. Buffy tells him, "I can't do this alone," but this proves to be most ironically incorrect.

Clearly Whedon constructs each season around two half-season story arcs. The first half of Season 2 heralds the arrival of Spike and Dru, and the quick departure of "The Annoying One." Of course now we look back and are amazed at what James Marsters has done with the role of Spike, but at this point it is Juliet Landau's ditzy psychotic vampire who provides the flair of the dark side. Whedon brings the first half to a climax in "What's My Line?," the show's first two-parter, where we are introduced to Kendra the Vampire Slayer. It seems Buffy's brief moment of death at the hands of the Master in "Prophecy Girl" has some long reaching implications we only begin to appreciate at this point. But with the return of Angelus everything changes. Spike and Drusilla are trying to reassemble the Judge, a grotesque who cannot be killed "by any weapon forged." Then everybody learns the truth about not only Angel's transformation but also Jenny's betrayal. Thus begins the deadly game of cat and mouse between Angel and his former allies, which culminates in the two parts of "Becoming." 

Both parts of "Becoming" are written and directed by Whedon, and represent the apex of his work on the series. When Angeleus opens the portal to Hell, only his blood can close it, but things are not going to be that easy for Buffy. The dramatic culmination contains the best fight sequence (with swords) in a show that prides itself on innovative staging of its fights, and is an ultimately emotionally shattering experience captured beautifully by Sarah Michelle Gellar's slow dissolve into tears while the haunting Sarah McLachlan song "Full of Grace" is played. Joss Whedon had set this moment up from the first episode of the series. It is a payoff usually reserved for the final episode of a series and not simply the end of the second season. "Becoming" is truly an astounding accomplishment in the history of dramatic television and when you watch the entire second season again you can appreciate how brilliantly this shattering conclusion is set up. 

The original theatrical film was a teaser, the first season on television was an appetizer, but the second season of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" was epic and once you see this, whether again or for the first time, you are not going to want to stop here. It was also nice to see that the extras went up a couple of notches for the Season 2 DVD collection, especially since we expect more goodies from Whedon and crew, especially given the high quality of "The Watchers Guide," the show's official companion volumes.  There was a lot of thought put into this show, which means any and all insights and looks behind the curtain are greatly appreciated

Release the bats is definatly one of my favorite dvds i own. It will show you a side of pete wentz and others you may or may not want to see... i thought it was very interesting to see and its kind of cool to see another side others may not have. You also get to find out who Dirty is or whatever. Pete says things about him in a couple of places (online) and all i could think is "who is that?" so thats also very exciting. I would say as long as you have a good sense of humor your pretty much safe buying this.
remember: its the stuff deemed 'unfit' for "my heart with always be the b-side to my tongue

While I thought the series was getting a bit old by the 3rd movie, this is still a very good price for getting 3 decent movies.  All have their funny moments.  I still enjoy the first the best.  Mainly because the jokes were original and fresh.  Though it is still funny to see the strange things Jim would get himself into.  Levy as his father was a great choice.  This is worth the 20 dollars easy.  Lots of laughs, and plenty of gross out humor

It's not a great movie, but it's a lot of fun.  This is one of those movies that just catches me.  It's quirky and has some decent (for it's day) effects.  There are a feww laugh out loud momments.  Truth be told they are few and far between.  

Some great bit characters make up a fun ensemble.  The cast is pretty damn cool, with Urich being upstaged by Ron Pearlman, Angellica Houston, John Mat.. Mattus... The big guy.  Anyway, it's cornball comedy with a basic plot.  

Hey what do you want?  It's 80's chessy goodness and more fun that it should have been.

I still giggle at the time warp battle

Maggie Gyllenhaal played her part to perfection, scarily so.  She's the perfect sociopath, only thinking of herself while using her daughter, as well as anyone else she encounters, as a foil.  She's a master manipulator and feels no remorse for using anyone unlucky enough to cross her path.

All in all a real slice of life film accurately depicted, directed and played

Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Nineteenth century novella "Notes from Underground" and the plot of this twenty first century movie carry identical messages. The movie is an eloquent cinematic adaptation of the novel that gives Dostoevsky's central character a new breath of life from the modern day perspective.

The movie attempts to survey the convoluted mind of a building inspector through a video-taped self confession. The psychological similarities between the character in Dostoevsky's novel and the building supervisor in the movie are uncanny. Both characters share a state of mind that is the epitome of a human condition where miserable anti hero attitude reigns through a heightened level consciousness and the rationality of everyday living through action is put to rest. The character in the movie who identifies himself as a "sick man, a spiteful man" lives his life in isolation by the drowning himself into the puddle of his own conflicting thoughts. He despises his friends and at the same time he seems eager to improve his relationship with them.  

The character in the movie voluntarily creates unpleasant scenarios that trigger his eventual self demise. He often finds himself confined within the conflicting walls of his consciousness. He falls in love with a prostitute but at the same time he is utterly disgusted by her profession and tries to dominate her. By escalating the level of his thought process well above the habitual human awareness, the central character of the movie isolates himself from the crowd that Dostoevsky's narrator identifies as the "Men of Action". The building supervisor is paralyzed by the own consciousness just like the narrator in Dostoevsky's novel. 

Dostoevsky's novel and the movie helps us realize that the collective standard of self-consciousness that the society forces us to adapt through a methodical process of uniformity and conformity, has a negative side effect that is strong enough to paralyze our lives and inflict a profound sense of alienation in our minds.

I saw the original about 4-5 times from 1970-1971.. This one is not much different, just modestly.. I had been attempting to purchase this flick for 30 years, but was unable because the Studio (Warner Bros.) refused to release it under any format.. I was thrilled that it was finally released, and have since been watching it with many friends.. Most had no idea this movie was ever out.. I was particularly interested in Anita Palenburg, she has really changed over the last 38 years.. The content may be a bit provacative for most (Sex and Violence) but the quality are extraodinary for that era.. This one is a must for anyone.

This film had a powerful effect on me. 95% of the people I know don't read books. I met a millionaire not long ago, who boasted to me that he had never read a book in his life. Lady Di was reported never to have read anything --- except perhaps fashion mags. My children hardly read, and their husbands and wives certainly don't. My ex-wife never read anything. Her father thought Ulysses was a dirty book. I stopped watching television in 1980, and I own 10,000 books --- but not Fahrenheit 451, which I'd read about 45 years ago. This was long enough for me not to compare the film with Bradbury's text, but the message came through the movie medium loud and clear, and with a very solid punch to the plexus. The manner in which it is written, played and directed, added to its impact. This world of sleep-walkers perfectly matched what is already all around us. The style was strange, but gradually you realise that this strangeness is actually what is now completely normal. People live and work like automated morons. They can't think for themselves, and their critical faculties are almost totally atrophied. They can't conduct a stimulating conversation of any kind: in fact, present them with an idea, or attempt to initiate a discussion, and they'll often become angry. Some of the several low end reviews on this site illustrate precisely what the film depicts. Ludicrous suggestions: remake it with mad Mel Gibson. Have infantile Spielberg direct it. Bulk it out with computerised SFX. These ghastly proposals precisely reflect the mentality of the sub-humans which the film targets, and many of them seem unable to understand their own language, let alone write it, or spell it. This is a memorable film, for those whose memories still function. Unlike the Captain of the firemen

In an attempt to meet more girls, I took French many, many years ago when I was still in junior high school (middle school to you young 'uns). In class, my French teacher treated us to a film screening of Jean Cocteau's LA BELLE ET LA BETE (BEAUTY AND THE BEAST). Truthfully, back then, I didn't think much of it other than being something too "arty." But, over the past two decades, I've seen this film a number of times and now have a decidedly higher opinion of it. LA BELLE ET LA BETE is a seriously important movie and a groundbreaking entry into the world of cinema. It's certainly Cocteau's masterpiece. Without a doubt, it provided the direct inspiration for Disney's Oscar-nominated version, as well as greatly influencing CBS's 1987 BEAUTY AND THE BEAST television series.

Jean Cocteau took Madame Leprince de Beaumont's classic story, adapted it, and put his own stamp on it. Cocteau's artistic vision is dazzling to behold. The viewer is treated to a delectable visual feast replete with disturbingly aware statues, ghostly arms jutting out of walls to clutch  candles, vocal household objects, jewelry which turns to rubbish, etc. But nicely juxtaposed with the imaginative, surrealistic trappings are the more mundane sequences revolving around Belle's family, which serve to somewhat ground the fairy tale to a more reality-based semblance.      

This atmospheric film was given an enormous lift by the very wonderful performances of the two leads, Josette Day and Jean Marais. Josette Day, as Belle, her most luminous role, personified beauty, grace, and class. Jean Marais, on the other hand, made women and young girls swoon in his dual roles as the handsome scoundrel Avenant and the tortured but gentle-hearted Beast. In fact, Marais portrayed the fearsome Beast in such a sympathetic and romantic light that, in the end, when the hirsute and awful monster was transformed into the handsome prince, Cocteau and Marais actually received many letters of complaint. The women much preferred their kindly Beast. 

************************************************************

The Criterion Collection's high-definition, crystal clear digital transfer is awesome to experience, lending a lushness and clarity that was lacking in the older, grainier copies. This film is also well-stocked with special features: 

- 2 audio commentaries 
- a Philip Glass opera soundtrack option 
- "Screening at the Majestic" -  a 1995 documentary featuring interviews with the cast and crew 
- Interview with the film's Director of Photography Henri Alekan 
- "Secret Professionels: Tete a Tete" (Professional Secrets: Face to Face) -  the title of a French television show, of which particular 1965 episode showcases makeup artist Hagop Arakelian, who worked on LA BELLE ET LA BETE  
- the original trailer 
- the restoration trailer 
- Film Restoration segment 
- Stills Gallery
- a booklet which includes Jean Cocteau's notes on the film and a reprinted translation of Madame Leprince de Beaumont's original fable.

"Domestic Disturbance" is a thriller about a divorced couple and their child.  Frank (John Travolta) has to deal with a man marrying his ex-wife Susan.  The guy (Vince Vaughn) is well liked by the community, but there are hints of something being amiss with him.  Frank's son claims he witnesses his mother's new husband Rick commit murder.  The more Frank investigates Rick, the more suspicious he looks.  The investigation spurs a game of cat and mouse.

There is great interaction between Travolta as a concerned parent and Vaughn the cold heartless type.  The tension between them breeds suspense.  The would-be new father uses his craftiness to manipulate those around him.  There are few things he wouldn't do to get his way.  

"Domestic Disturbance" is entertaining with its high-tension suspense and great action.  I highly recommend it for those who enjoy a thriller that will keep you guessing to the last minutes.

Based on Bizet's tragic Spanish opera, this was Rita Hayworth's first film made by her production company, Beckworth (derived from her screen surname and from the name of her daughter, Rebecca). She decided on her close friend and favorite leading man, Glenn Ford, as Don Jose to her Carmen. The results are far better than some reviews would have you believe.

The glorious, lush Techincolor is fabulous (studio-bound as most of the sets may be), while Hayworth's unforgettable screen presence, dancing and bewitching beauty, and the heat generated between her and Ford makes this movie memorable. The sequence in which she describes what virtues a lover should have (complete with putting her finger to his lips) sparkles with sensual static. Granted, Ford looks stiff and ill at ease in his uniform (after he sheds his soldier garb and dons his "bandit clothing", he appears much more relaxed).

If it is deemed worthy enough to be released as part of the Columbia Classics collection, so should "Affair In Trinidad", another Hayworth/Ford collaboration.

It's just great to look at, flaws aside. If you adore Rita and Glenn, even in a tempestuous, volatile romance, this movie will provide that for you.

Was there ever a more enticing, tempestous gypsy with so many men in her life but only one true and ultimately tragic love?

A film that centers on four friends who made a pact to leave their small town arrive at zero hour and must decide if they will go through with it. The story is simple enough, and not a whole lot happens. But there's no denying it, this movie is enjoyable and aesthetically pleasing in every way. It's a treat to see an intelligent movie where the main charachters are teenagers, and that the film doesn't have to resort too fart jokes for an audience. Not one charachter is stereotyped. They are human, and they'll probably remind you of people you know. I applaud this kind of a movie, and I wish there would be more of them

Daniel Deronda: George Eliot's classic 1876 novel comes alive in this BBC Drama

  Daniel Deronda is George Eliot's 1876 novel dealing with the
rise of Zionism incarnated in young Daniel Deronda. Sadly but truly this is the first major English novel giving a positive view of the Jewish people.
  Deronda is raised by the wealthy Sir Malinger as an English
gentleman. In the course of the long novel and miniseries he learns he is a Jew; meets his mother and is the love object of
two fascinating women.
Mirah Lapidoth is the Jewish musician who is rescued from suicide by Daniel. Her love for Daniel burgeons as she comes to
know and love the kind young man.
Gwendolyn Harleth played by the brilliant acting of Romola
Garai is the spoiled,impecunious husband hunter who weds the
rich cad Grandcourt only to rue her unwise choice of mates!
She loves Deronda as her marriage becomes a torture chamber of
psychological combat. 
  Like all BBC productions this one is photographed in beautifully rich colors. The scenery is beautiful and the musical score is haunting to the ear.
   This tale runs about four hours and is a joy.Many American
viewers may be dismayed at the slow, leisurely pace of British
productions. Please remember that these productions are based
on long English novels which were published in several monthly
parts. They are long but they are also wonderful explorations of
the human soul. Gwendolyn's story is a bildungsroman in which she
grows as a person. Ditto for Deronda who learns to take pride in
his Hebrew heritage.
  This is a worthy BBC production well worth the viewer's time and money

While this DVD was obviously filmed in the early 1970s with the picture quality to match at times, the genius of David Bowie shines  through. As adults too young to remember or have seen Ziggy Stardust, it was an amazing look at the time period. The sound quality is suprisingly good, although some camera angles are distracting at times. It was also neat to hear Bowie's pronouncement of "This is our last tour ever." Little did he know... This DVD is worth every penny. Rock on

The transfers of the 5 movies found here are worth every penny! We grew up watching these on Philadelphia's channel 17 with show host Dr. Shock and the Creature Double Features back in the mid 70's. The pictures were always so dark and grainy, WELL NOT ANYMORE FOLKS! Universal has done an Amazing job on the picture clean-up and sound restoration! Bright and crystal clear along with wonderful sound! Also a very nice fold out DVD holder! The theatrical trailers were transferred in their original release condition which will allow you to compare how good of a job was done on the restoring of the movies to DVD! Don't wait to long in purchasing your set at a cheap price, they have already disappeared off of store shelves in our area!

The series just keeps on getting better.

The Bob Newhart show was one of the best comedies ever on television.   The other funny show was "Newhart", which I cannot understand why it has not been released on DVD.

The whole cast just clicks.  I wish shows like this were still on television.

If you enjoy a good laugh then buy this and the other sets!

If you're looking for a video that doesn't take a lot of time, then this is one that you should add to your collection.  It doesn't matter if you're a beginner or have been doing this stuff for years, there are two levels to suit both challenges.  10 minutes is spent on abs, buns &amp; thighs.  You can choose to do all of them or one of them when you get a spare 10 minutes.  The exercises are great and you can feel the burn in all your muscles.  If you do this video 3-5 times a week and eat a healthy diet, you'll easily lose inches and tighten up those &quot;loose&quot; areas

Some of the other reviews have said that the film is not editted properly and 'too slow'. I'm not a film-maker and cannot comment on that other than to say that they are wrong. The film is amazing. I'm not sure if there is ANY other movie or documentary that shows what a serialkiller-cum-dictator-cum-statesman is like. Nowadays people might not know who Idi Amin is, or what he did, so its important to read up a little so you can truely appreciate this movie. He plays accordian? You see him meeting with his 'advisors' (some of whom disappear so after.) You see him play acting like a grown-up boy with toy soldiers. You see his self-appointed royal pedigree and send his support for Nixon! Its fascinating and amazing. This is man that, self-proclaimed, actually ATE some of his rivals (not the whole body I hope). He killed many people directly and by his policies. His ego is outstanding and its an amazing movie. Apparently, there is a new movies coming out about Idi Amin starring Forrest Whitaker. He's a good actor and so I look forward to seeing it. But this is the REAL guy. Its amazing and a feat probably never to happen again

I don't often watch foreign films.  The reason being, as an American, I don't feel that I can ever fully grasp the cultural and linguistic subtleties needed to truly understand and enjoy these works.  French....  Spanish....  German...  etc.... regardless of nationality, genre, or time period, they generally leave me cold.   

With that in mind, I went into this with no doubts as to the film's greatness, but again, didn't think as an American I would be able to see it, as the situational nuances would be lost on me.   As it turned out, I was wrong, and found a sublime masterpiece that went down easily, and didn't seem obtuse or "foreign".   The experience could best be likened to watching "The Graduate", as you find yourself viewing seemingly mundane events and conversations, but the subtle turns in those events and words speak of such depth and gravity that you feel almost driven to your knees by the masterwork that you are watching. 

I won't recap the storyline, or discuss details of the movie itself, I just wanted to say that I went into this skeptical, expecting to find a picture that I couldn't relate to, but what I found was an immediate, compelling and moving work that speaks volumes of the human condition.

This is an awesome movie! I think its better than Anchors Aweigh. Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra are two baseball players named Eddie O'Brien and Dennis Ryan who play for the Wolves. During the off-season Eddie and Dennis are vaudeville stars. When they return for the baseball season the whole team is horrifed to hear that the new owner K.C. Higgins wants to take an active part in coaching. As it turns out the K in K.C. Higgins happens to stand for Katherine (Esther Williams) so the new owner is a woman. Katherine dosn't fall for womanizer Eddie so the two don't get along at all!! Dennis does fall for her though, but Katherine isn't in love with him. Shirley Delwyn (Betty Garrett) has her eyes on Dennis and she won't give up on him! Also in the cast is Jules Munshin who plays Nat Goldberg, Dennis and Eddie's baseball pal. 

This movie has a lot of great music.
The songs include "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" Frank and Gene sing this song as their vaudeville act. Also Williams sings this while swimming in the pool. 
"Yes, Indeedy" The boys sing this song to the baseball team when they return from their vaudeville act. Its about their love life.
"O'Brien to Ryan to Goldberg" Kelly, Sinatra, and Munshin sing this song! One of the best numbers!
"The Right Girl for Me" Sinatra sings this song to Williams.
"It's Fate, Baby"  Garrett sings this to Sinatra to prove that they were meant for each other. 
"Strictly USA" Probabley the best number everyone sings this at a party.
"Upon St. Patrick's Day" Kelly dances and sings to this great song. He sorta does this Irish gig. Kelly is truly the best dancer there ever was! This is one of the best numbers up there w/ Strictly USA.
At the end Kelly, Sinatra, Williams, Garrett sing to Strictly USA as the finale. It really great! The dvd has the following special features which are 2 deleted numbers called "Baby Face" and "Boys and Girls Like You and Me". It also contains the trailers of Anchors Aweigh, On the Town, and the trailer for this movie. Also includes notes on Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly. For some odd reason I love this movie! This is a must see if you are a Kelly fan

I enjoyed Francis Veber's 'The Closet' - released in France in 2001 - for two reasons.  First, it features an all-star ensemble of French acting, certainly a tribute to Veber's skill as a director.  Just take a gander at the first six names to appear on the IMDB credits:

Daniel Auteuil ....  François Pignon 
Gérard Depardieu ....  Félix Santini 
Thierry Lhermitte ....  Guillaume 
Michèle Laroque ....  Mlle Bertrand 
Michel Aumont ....  Belone, the neighbour 
Jean Rochefort ....  Kopel, the director 

Imagine a movie where the great Jean Rochefort gets slotted sixth.  Each of these six stars can carry a movie in France on their own back.  The fact that the group has teamed here is a testament to Veber's reputation.  His previous release, 1998's 'The Dinner Game,' was lauded far and wide as a comedic masterpiece.  Actors get attracted to that type of skill.

The second reason I got a kick out of watching 'The Closet':  I just learned that 'Bend It Like Beckham' writing partners Gurinder Chadha and Paul Mayeda Berges are prepping a UK re-make for the screen for a targeted 2006 release, with Chadha at the helm.  Her keen eye for comedy tinged with poignancy was confirmed by Beckham's runaway success, so I feel like I'm in on a really great secret knowing she's working on a re-make.

Overall, this is an extremely awesome concert. I am a big fan of DT, and like pretty much all their stuff. The performance itself is pretty good, although the only truly special thing they do is the instrumedley and Jordan's keyboard solo. Other than that they pretty much just play their songs as you hear them on the album. If they had done more special things, it would have gotten a 5 star rating instead of 4. Other people complain about how the band really doesnt get into their music during the performance, but  would say they did okay as far as that goes. Sure the singer doesnt get out from behind the mic stand, thats because half the time he is dragging it along with him, although i will say the band overall doesnt really get into it as much as most other metal bands, and thats probably why they have the video show up on the screens behind them. The special features are also pretty good, but i would not buy this concert just for those, backstage footage and things of that nature are cool but do not make a dvd good by themselves. Overall, i did think it was pretty cool, and i would recommend buying it if you like Dream Theater or just their genre of music in general

Plot Summary: A man-without-a-memory found floating in the Mediterranean Sea searches for his identity, discovering along the way pieces to the puzzle that ultimately paint him as a highly-trained government assassin.

Reason for the Rating: Violence and some language.

Based on the Robert Ludlum-authored book by the same name, THE BOURNE IDENTITY is part action flick, part stylized thriller. In his first role as an erstwhile action hero, Matt Damon shines as Bourne, imbuing the character with both an appropriate edginess and a comfortable-in-his-own-skin-even-though-he-doesn't-know-who-he-is ease.
As the story opens, Bourne is pulled out of the Mediterranean Sea and treated for suspicious bullet wounds by the crew of an Italian fishing boat. The "hey, this is a story about espionage" theme is introduced early as a crew member removes a tiny implant from Bourne that displays what we later learn is a Swiss bank account number. Upon finding and opening the safe deposit box, Bourne discovers multiple passports (including one with the name Jason Bourne), a variety of foreign currency, and a gun. He then begins his search to uncover his true identity--and until now, so does the audience.
If there is one misstep in THE BOURNE IDENTITY, it may be the fact that early scenes involving the CIA and the agency's frantic attempts to track him down give audience members the answer to Bourne's identity far earlier than Bourne himself. At this point the film becomes more of a "how will he survive?" thriller rather than a "who am I?" mystery.
A love interest of sorts (played nicely by Run Lola Run actress Franka Potente) gives Bourne a "partner in crime" to play off of for much of the movie, but her role seems more of a plot contrivance rather than a reasonable or logical plot development. An implied (off-screen) love scene for the two is just as implausible as it is brief, but doesn't detract too much from the action.
The most interesting (and morally significant) moment in the film comes when Bourne finally remembers who he is as well as the mission he was on. Through this pivotal flashback (and some foreshadowing that finally makes sense), we learn that the highly-trained killing machine isn't capable of pulling the trigger upon seeing his assassination target's children in the room with him. Bourne's hesitation nearly costs him his life and sets the course for the film's premise as he is shot, falling into the Mediterranean Sea.
Smartly directed, THE BOURNE IDENTITY is fast-paced without feeling rushed. The Cinematographer paints the European setting in shades of grays and yellows, giving the movie a unique noir-like look that fits well with the drama. As an action film decorated with whodunit sensibilities, this film is a winner for older teens and adults.

Nappaland.com Recommends: Ignore the plot contrivances and just enjoy the ride--THE BOURNE IDENTITY is a worthy discovery.

After the Show...If members of your family choose to view this movie, use these questions to spark discussion about it afterward:
---What do you think prompted Jason Bourne to pause when he was preparing to shoot his assassination target on the yacht? What does this say about Bourne's moral compass?
---How would you feel if you suddenly couldn't remember who you were? What actions would you take to discover your identity?
---When faced with the horror of who he really is and what he has done, Jason Bourne longs for a chance to erase his past and start his life anew. When have you felt that way? How can a relationship with Jesus give us a "second chance" in the truest sense?

Ladies in Lavender is a rare gem in the movie world of today.  This is a soft spoken tale that ignores age and looks to character.  Beautiful roles for older women may be hard to find these days and when a movie comes along with two such roles you could not ask for anything better than to have two wonderful Ladies, Judi Dench and Maggie Smith, take on those roles.  This movie was adapted from a short story of the same title but its silver screen life comes from the actors who played their parts to perfection.

The movie takes place in a small Cornish village where the viewer is given an immediate sense of isolation - perhaps isolation from life, from emotions and from vulnerabilities.  The sisters Ursula and Janet Widdington, played by Dench and Smith, spend a quiet, uninvolved existence, venturing out rarely.  But on one of their walks along the beach that they find a young man washed ashore after a storm.  A bit befuddled they nevertheless take this young may into their home to help him recuperate.  This one act of kindness leads to unexpected consequences for we see that age is not a barrier to unleashing emotions, feelings that have been hidden for so many years.  It is the ability of Dench and Smith to portray these emotions, these feelings, for the camera that make this movie sing.  And the melody of the movie is also carried nicely by the supporting roles played by Daniel Bruhl and Natascha McElhone.  Together these actors make this move work on several levels to give the viewer a splendid evening's entertainment.

I enjoyed watching queen Latifah in a more mature acting. But the picture quality of the DVD that i bought was terrible (Thanx to amazon). To my surprise all the trailers quality were superb but the movie was Terrible terrible and terrible. To be honest the quality of the picture spoilt the fun side of the movie but still I say big ups to Queen(Uyisikhokho ntombazana). I had to use this platform although its of irrelevancy to comment about the movie format. "Enjoy everyday like its your last

This is one of the better historical dramas from the 1970s.  Many are stagey and slow, and while this production of MADAME BOVARY is very much constrained to stay indoors, this works to advantage for this story of a woman who feels so trapped by her life and her world.

Emma Bovary is not a very sympathetic creature.  She is married to a man who loves her with all his heart, who tries to give her everything she wants, is willing to ruin himself to make her happy, and she still cheats on him and remains miserable.  In short, she is selfish and inconsiderate, as ugly inside as she is pretty on the outside.  

Francesca Annis plays Emma.  She is indeed very beautiful.  As an actress she often comes across as bright and hard, flirty and flighty, but cold and self satisfied.  These qualities, of course, are perfect for this character.  Here she seems to be more in love with the idea of being in love than actually loving.  Almost anything to break up the dismal tedium of her life and her disgust with everyone and everything in it.

It is very hard for a modern audience to feel sorry for her.  Her daily trial does not include housework or drudgery, she has maids for that.  She is bored because she is useless, she is useless because she is too lazy to seek something meaningful to do; she wants life to be a party, and resents it when it is not.

Tom Conti plays her devoted husband, who is completely devoid of ambition, in work or society.  As an actor, Conti often seems to have just woken from a nap, and this dampness is just right for Dr. Bovary.  He too is very lazy in his way, but his seems to stem from ignorance.  When contrasted with Emma's willfulness, her husband seems the infinitely better of the two.  Conti is really fine here as a man completely out of his depth with this racehorse of a wife.  

In much the same way, while Annis is briskly carrying every scene, Conti just quietly steals every one of them.  A perfect pairing for these roles.

All the actors here are top notch, and the casting a bit off beat, which adds to the interest.  The costumes, especially Emmas, are a luxurious parade of overindulgence.  Absolutely beautiful. While we as an audience enjoy the parade of finery, we can also see how this wardrobe would drive even the richest man into the poorhouse.  The production is topped off with a novel and lovely score of predominantly piano compositions; pretty and liltling, but melancholy and dissonant.

Don't let this one get lost in the shuffle, it is worth seeing.

This documentary on the life of Louis Armstrong, one of the major proponents of the jazz genre of music, is a quick look at how Louis Armstrong developed into a jazz musician as a vocalist, trumpeter, band leader, and arranger.

'Louis Armstrong - Satchmo' starts with Louis's life growing up in New Orleans and how he spent much of his time in an orphan home playing in a band, which is where his skill had room to take off.  The documentary follows his move to Chicago and his involvement in the early jazz recordings.

The DVD contains excerpts of live performances and also tracks Louis Armstrong's gradual but swelling rise to fame and how he attained the nickname "Satchmo".  Louis, with his love for performing, became a famous musical figure and eventually had the rare achievement of being featured as a performer in many movies.  The docu-biography reveals how Louis never lost his lovable, down-to-earth manner, even with the increased size of his audience.  Louis was just Louis, and he would always be loved for his smile, his lovable personality, and of course his music.  

Containing interviews with Tony Bennett and Wynton Marsalis, 'Louis Armstrong - Satchmo' is a pleaser about a jazz player's rise to become an enormously famous popular entertainer.  And he never lost his charm.  We love you, Louie

It's my first semester teaching a general-student Jazz History course, and I wanted something beyond the textbook to get the students involved.  I bought this video as a &quot;best-of-all-options&quot; choice, and was  bowled over by it's thoroughness and attention to detail.  Everything we'd  discussed about Armstrong during class was there on the tape, reinforcing  my lectures and giving the kids a nice opportunity to both hear AND see the  legendary Louis.  For pure entertainment alone it was worthwhile, but for  instructional purposes I'd consider it a necessity for any future jazz  classes I'd teach.  I paid $16 bucks for it, but having seen it I think  I'd've paid fifty!  (Shh!  Don't tell Amazon!

WE ARE HALFWAY THROUGH THE FRIENDS SERIES...5 DOWN, 5 TO GO!

The 5th Season of Friends is the season where: 
*Monica and Chandler start their relationship
*Ross gets married...AGAIN to RACHEL out of being very very drunk!
*They pass the 100th episode
Whenever I watch Season Five all I can really say is that it is easily watchable and is quite good, but it isnt my favourite season. For some reason I notice the episodes are kind of all over the place and its not like it used to be. Dont get me wrong I still  love the show and this Season is good, but this one isn't vital. I personally only bought this season for that episode where Monica has a turkey on her head with the big glasses and hat and then dances! I know! Stupid! Lol but its classic!
This season Box set isnt desperately needed in your collection, unless you want to see Monica and Chandler start their relationship and hide it with Joey covering for them constantly (The One With Ross's Sandwich is great when Joey covers for Monica and Chandler!)
The top 5 Episodes are very easy to pick for this particular season. 
My Personal Top 5 Episodes Are:
The One With All The Kissing
The One Hundredth (Has to be here! The 100th!)
The One with the Thanksgiving Flashbacks
The One Where Everybody Finds Out (BEST HERE!!!!)
The One Where Rachel Smokes

I didnt care much for the Season Finale, I mean, identical hand twin?? Not very funny. Very time wasting!. The only really good thing in the final is The Very Last Scene!!!

Overall, not a stellar season, Not as good as Season 3 or 4 but definitley up there somewhere. Not desperatley needed in your collection, IF ONLY COLLECTING A FEW. Contains some very good episodes. The One Where Everybody Finds Out is a highlight! Check that out

I was never a diehard Huey Lewis fan but this group definitely adds to that genre we call rock n roll. If you're looking for another dvd you can add to your concert collection, this one is worth the price of admission. I'm not familiar with all the original members so just having Huey as the front man and with the other members cranking out the songs as I remembered them, it was memorable, high-energy performance. One little thing was somewhat of a distraction to me. About halfway through the show, Huey's shirt had a meltdown. All of a sudden it looked like he got caught in a major downpour. Am I the only one that noticed this? But it just goes to show the man was giving it all he had. Who could ask for more

The Star Trek Collection is a worthy hobby and certainly the largest of the television series DVD Collections (The Original Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager and Enterprise). At around 1100 minutes per box (a few hours less than the TOS seasons) we are still looking at approx 30 boxes with 700 hours of viewing. That is 1 month of non-stop Star Trek. No DVD series comes remotely close to that. Get going collecting right now and build up on each succession over the years. By the end you will have a very serious anthology that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time for the next few years. It is a cherished memory that served your fathers and will serve your children also. Our very planet, Earth, has advanced because of Gene Roddenberry's admirable concept. Roddenberry nailed the premise of the series when he said that he wanted to create a show with characters that we could look up too. `The Bridge' members are like our family. Watch what they do. Then go and spend your life striving for the same on Earth. What engineer, medic, scientist, teacher, worker can not say that Star Trek has not influenced them? The show is this significant in the development of our species. Even Christians respect and quote its authority and it is not hard to see why. The DVD case is not quite as fancy as the TOS (The Original Series) cases. The TNG case is supposed to resemble a TNG crew briefcase. The case opens to reveal the disc booklet inside a sleeve. Sliding the disc booklet out of the sleeve and flipping it open reveals a spread of 7 discs. There are 4 episodes per disc. However the last disc, disc 7, only has two episodes, for a grand total of 26 episodes (TOS has 8 Discs, 30 episodes). The rest of disc 7 is devoted to Star Trek interviews and trailers with the usual expected extras...and then some more. The episodes are ordered not in the sequence they where filmed, but in the sequence that they aired, however each episode has been numbered according to the order they where filmed in. This means on one disc you have shows 4, 2, 12 and 1, in that order. The sound has also been remastered to 5:1 Dolby Digital! Since the show was shot in full frame, these dimensions are retained.

Star Trek, The Next Generation (TNG), Season One, had an amazing impact when it was first broadcast. An instant hit and a milestone in television serials (it ran for 7 seasons unlike its predecessor that ran for 3), its characters and new look Enterprise had us glued to the TV with the first computer generated images of our solar system as Captain Picard utters the immortal words... `To baldly'... I mean... `To boldly go where no man'... I mean... `To boldly go where no one has gone before.' Viewing the episodes in the order they where filmed does not show a vision in the shaping as per the TOS series but is more of the same again (even remaking some TOS episodes), this time with more characters, more action and more special effects. 

SEASON 1
All of the main characters in the TNG series are in episode one, Captain Jean-Luc Picard,  Commander William T. Riker,  Lieutenant/Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge, Lieutenant Tasha Yar, Lieutenant Worf, Commander Dr. Beverly Crusher, Lt. Commander/Commander Deanna Troi, Lt. Commander Data and Ensign Wesley Crusher.  Only Natasha Yar quits before the first season is finished. Commander Dr. Beverly Crusher is replaced by Doctor Katherine Pulaski for Season two. Ensign Wesley Crusher is only sometimes reoccurring after Season four. The Enterprise itself is beautifully rendered with additional areas such as the holodeck allowing for almost any environment at the users choosing, playing an important function in many episodes. The use of computer generated images (a ground-breaking television experience back in 1987!) allowed for inspirational subspace sequences, planets, backdrops, an improved bridge main viewer and windows! Advances in makeup effects brought new alien characters to life and allowed an actor to appear as if he where indeed an android. TNG Season One attempts to relate with TOS by reviving similar stories while at the same time adding on additional insights into new and fascinating sci-fi theory while retaining most of the character arcs that made TOS so interesting. The stories (also written by TOS's DC Fontana) are as fresh today as they where in the late 80s, early 90s, when TNG first aired. Season One of TNG is mostly about deities, infections, alien cultures, galactic politics, time travel, alien forces, mind control, family matters, computer malfunctions and Starfleet Academy. There are also the unforgettable episodes `Encounter at Farpoint' which introduces us to the crew of the Enterprise and the mysterious Q,  `Where No One has Gone Before' a wonderful story about travelling the cosmos, `Datalore' which features two Data characters, `Heart of Glory' with some in-depth revelations about Klingons , `Skin of Evil' featuring some remarkable effects for its time with a very sad ending, and the classic `Conspiracy' (this episode is uncut, which features some violent scenes involving a head explosion edited from some daytime television showings [so parents be cautious]) about an invasion of the body snatchers type takeover of Starfleet. The bottom line for TNG: Season One is that it will bring back some enormously delightful memories for those who where awe inspired by it when it first came out. Although we can debate about which is the better series, TNG or TOS, we still absolutely adore both. We might miss Kirk rolling about the desert scrub with a seven foot man in a rubber reptile costume, but hearing Picard saying `make it so' just makes our day.

SEASON 2
Season Two, still carries on with repeating much of the stories in TOS, revamping them and then adding some new stuff of its own, boosting Data's screen time, bumping up the computer generated graphics to allow for things like shuttlecraft launching and manoeuvres, improved alien CGI and an enhancement in particle effects. They even attempt a type of morphing. Most of the main characters from Season One are here, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Commander William T. Riker (now with a beard), Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge, Lieutenant Commander Worf (letting his hair grow), Commander Deanna Troi (complete with low-cut red starfleet costume), Lt. Commander Data and Ensign Wesley Crusher. However obviously Commander Lieutenant Tasha Yar is gone but so is Dr. Beverly Crusher (who was not bad-looking), replaced by Doctor Katherine Pulaski (who looks like your granny!) for Season Two because Dr. Crusher has been reassigned to Starfleet Medical as explained in episode one of Season Three (in reality the TNG writers where having difficulties in developing Crusher's character, would later reinstate her for Season Three, dropping Pulaski because they felt her character was not working). Colm Meaney as Miles Edward O'Brien, Navigation from Season One gets more screentime, while the new Whoopi Goldberg chatacter, Guinan, is the wise El Aurian bartender in 10 Forward, the new bar room where the Enterprise crew get to relax. Except for this extra area the Enterprise itself has not gone undergone much of a revamp and this season is far more Enterprise based than Season One, or all of TOS, meaning Season Two has less planetary exploration stories which is a bit of a drawback, but sets a new standards in the `hotel in space' feel that would produce the `Deep Space Nine' series. Season Two of TNG is mostly about alien impregnation, mystery space, AI, the holodeck, interplanetary relations, rapid aging, justice, shape-shifting, time travel, family, the prime directive, kidnapping, cloning, war games and infections. The big plus side to not having that much planetary exploration is that there are lots of stories with Klingons and the first encounter with the BORG! The unforgettable episodes are, `Elementary, Dear Data' where Data takes on his Sherlock Holmes persona and we are introduced to the Moriarty character. `Loud as a Whisper' is about a deaf and dumb peace negotiator. `A Matter of Honor' is where Riker serves on a Klingon battleship. `Q Who?' may well be the best episode here because it is the first time we meet the Borg. The last episode of Season Two `Shades of Gray' may be one of the worst Star Trek episodes ever, which uses Riker's memories from Seasons One and Two to make up an entire episode and even includes the uncut scenes for the Season One episode `Conspiracy' featuring the violent head explosion edited from some daytime television showings [so parents be cautious again]). The bottom line for TNG: Season Two is that for all it shortcomings because of lack of beaming down, we get the Borg and lots and lots of Klingons. At this stage in the saga we might still miss Kirk rolling about the desert scrub with a seven foot man in a rubber reptile costume, but how will Picard defeat those assimilating half-man, half-machine entities that are heading his way? He better "make it so" with Season Three.

SEASON 3
It was the dawn of the 90s and since CGI had undergone some development, the improvements can be seen not only in the new opening sequence, but with better looking planets (complete with moving gaseous atmospheres) and major enhancements in particle effects. Towards the end it undergoes new model development, lighting and subspace effects of a movie budget look. The crew uniform has changed with a new type of collar. Most of the main characters from Season Two are here, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Commander William T. Riker (now with a bigger belly), Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge, Lieutenant Commander Worf (letting his hair grow even more), Commander Deanna Troi (with more makeup, costume changes and even an aerobics outfit [that really isn't as good as it sounds]), Lieutenant Commander Data and Ensign Wesley Crusher (new hairdo). Dr. Beverly Crusher is back (initially with a terrible hairdo that gets better) and Doctor Katherine Pulaski has been dropped from the show never to reappear again. Pulaski's disappearance is not officially explained (in reality Diana Muldaur was told her character was not working and she was offered a role in L.A. Law instead. McFadden was asked to rejoin the series again) the crew do act like she has just left because her time was up with Dr. Crusher making reference to Pulaski's work in Episode four. Commander Lieutenant Tasha Yar makes a surprise guest appearance for one episode! Dwight Schultz (Murdoch from the A-Team) makes his first appearance as Lieutenant `Reg' Barkley, who would have a reoccurring role. Colm Meaney is here again as Miles Edward O'Brien, Navigation, doesn't have much of a role boost since Season Two, while the Whoopi Goldberg's Guinan character of the wise El Aurian, the bartender in 10 Forward, has her background further developed. Season Three of TNG is mostly about nanotechnology, colonization, super aliens, the prime directive, orphans, ancient space booby traps, Romulans, wormholes, peace negotiations, defectors, super humans, terrorism, Q, court inquisitions, parallel universes, AI, Klingon high councils, captivity experiments, time travellers, biological space crafts, morale, the first law of robotics, Vulcans, Sarek, evolutionary speciation, and the Borg. Unlike Season Two there is much more planetary exploration and lots of alien encounters. There are loads of unforgettable episodes in this Season, "Evolution" where nanotechnology takes over the Enterprise, "The Survivors" is a mystery about a single household that is the only structure to survive an alien invasion on a whole planet, "Who Watches The Watchers?" is about the prime directive failing when the Enterprise team are spotted and kidnapped, "Offspring" sees Data creating another sentient android, "Sins of the Father" has Worf return to his Klingon homeworld to defend his family honour, "Hollow Pursuits" has Lt. Barkley fantasizing about crew members in the Holodeck, "Sarek" is about the Vulcan of the same name from Star Trek: The Original Series, who is back for what looks like his final peace negotiation, and of course the pot-boiler end episode of "The Best of Both Worlds, Part I" (widely acclaimed as one of the best Star Trek episodes ever!) marks the grand entrance of Locutus of Borg onto the scene. The bottom line for TNG: Season Three is that it is often cited by fans as the best TNG Season and is probably the first of the Seasons to really be worth the price tag demanded of these very expensive box sets. In Season Three everyone seems to have matured, included the writers who are giving us exactly what we want and the series has a serious enough budget to make every episode look like a movie, especially towards the end. There is lots in this season to enjoy and of course not since J.R. Ewing had been shot did we get the kind of cliff-hanger episode that "The Best of Both Worlds, Part I" would deliver on, meaning every Trekie (and who wasn't at this time) across the planet from LA to Hong Kong had to wait all summer to learn how Picard could be saved. There is no time to loose!!! Onto Season Four. .... wooosshhhh.

SEASON 4
Not since J.R. Ewing had been shot did we get the kind of cliff-hanger episode that "The Best of Both Worlds, Part I" would deliver on at the end of Season III, meaning every Trekie (and who wasn't at this time) across the planet from LA to Hong Kong had to wait all summer to learn how Picard could be saved. There was no time to lose!!! Onto Season Four. .... wooosshhhh... so here we are. With Season Three it was the dawn of the 90s and CGI had undergone some development and improvements (better looking planets with moving gaseous atmospheres, particle effects, lighting and subspace effects). With Season Three things started to have more of a movie budget look. Season Four tries to maintain that class. Most of the main characters from Season Two are here, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Commander William T. Riker, Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge, Lieutenant Commander Worf (who keeps growing that hair), Commander Deanna Troi, Lieutenant Commander Data, Dr. Beverly Crusher and Ensign Wesley Crusher (now a Starfleet officer with full uniform, also departs from TNG half way through this Season, and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining three seasons). Colm Meaney is here again as Miles Edward O'Brien and Whoopi Goldberg's Guinan. Lots of characters who had small episode roles are back for Season Four such as Worf's lover K'Ehleyr, the Traveller, K'Mpec the Klingon leader, Duras whose dishonesty caused Worf's discommendation and the Romulan Tomalak. There is also a surprise character at the end of this season. Season Four of TNG is mostly about the Borg, family, Dr. Soong and the AI emotion chip, adoption, the space-time continuum, hostage rescue, the Klingon High Council, Romulans, alternative universes, holographic projection, survival,  loosing special abilities, renegade captains, the devil, amnesia, first contact, love, nightmares, mutations, super intelligence, Robin Hood, witch hunt trials, euthanasia, host life forms, mind control and honour. Like Season Three most the episodes in Season Four have great stories, combining both planetary exploration and the life of the crew instead of dealing with either one or the other as the initial seasons did. It is a well balanced season overall and a good deal more exciting than maybe its three previous seasons now that things are firmly established. Apart from containing Part II of `The Best of Both Worlds', the introduction of the Cardassians, who would become major players in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine franchise, makes it even more valuable. There are loads of unforgettable episodes in this Season, `The Best of Both Worlds, Part II' concludes the cliff-hanger from Season Three with some great battle special effects, `Family' has Picard going home to see his brother and family, `Brothers' features Dr. Soong who is Data's creator, `Reunion' returns to the story of Worf and his Klingon dishonour, `The Wounded' features the Cardassians for the first time, `Clues' has Data disobeying Picard, `First Contact' sees Riker exposed as an alien on a planet he is monitoring, the `The Nth Degree' has Barclay taking control of the Enterprise with his new special powers of intelligence, `QPid' for its historical recreation of Robin Hood and of course `Redemption, Part I' which deals with Worf's dishonour. The bottom line for TNG: Season Four is that it keeps up the pace of Season Three, and is worth the price tag demanded of these very expensive box sets. Everyone has matured and the writers are giving us exactly what we want. Although not quite the cliff-hanger end episode that "The Best of Both Worlds, Part I" was, `Redemption, Part I' still concerns the loss of a main character to the other side and introduces the surprise return of a person we know. We are left asking ourselves, if the `hard man' is really gone and why does `she' look like a Romulian! As Picard would say "I can live with a mystery" but we just can't! Onto Season Five as quick as we can...

SEASON 5
Season 5 has a remarkable improvement in visual effects. The display panels on the enterprise are more interactive. The camera can now pan as special effects take place. Deep space battles seem more intense. We also get a new Star Trek title graphic in the opening sequence. The cliff-hanger conclusion of "Redemption, Part II" is a great episode although slightly lacking in the promise of a civil war battle between Klingons, Romulans and the Federation, turns out to be more of a character episode than the big epic battler we thought we would get. None-the-less, it is still a good episode that reveals some things about the family of Tasha Yar. Most of the main characters from Season Two are here, Captain Jean-Luc Picard (with a new red suede coat and grey uniform), Commander William T. Riker, Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge (who sports a new beard in one episode), Lieutenant Commander Worf (who left the Enterprise in Season Four), Commander Deanna Troi, Lieutenant Commander Data and Dr. Beverly Crusher. Ensign Wesley Crusher (who departed from Season Four half way and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining three seasons) returns for some episodes but is mainly replaced by the new Ensign Ro Laren, a Bajoran. Colm Meaney is here again as Miles Edward O'Brien as is Whoopi Goldberg's Guinan. Alexander Rozhenko as Worf's son now has a reoccurring role since Season Four. Keiko O'Brien, (Miles O'Brien's wife) is firmly established as a reoccurring character. Watch out for the special appearances of Ashley Judd as Ensign Robin Lefler and Leonard Nimoy as Spock! Whoot! Whoot! Strangely enough this is the only season where Q, of the omnipotent Q Continuum, does not make an appearance. Lieutenant Reginald Barclay, engineer is also absent from this Season. Season Four of TNG is mostly about the Klingon High Council, Romulans, communication, Bajora, crystalline entities, disasters, addiction, reunification, time travel, parenting, telekinesis, eugenics, amnesia, possession, euthanasia, sexual repression, time warps, children, cover-ups, sexual attraction, imaginary friends, Borg, invisibility, alternative lives and phase shifting. Like Season Four most the episodes in Season Five have great stories, a perfect balance of planetary exploration and the life of the crew. It much more of the same as in Season Four with the better episodes being `Redemption, Part II', `Darmok' an interesting episode about language, the introduction of the Bajora and Ensign Ro, the Silicon Avatar makes a return, `Unification', Part I and II (both here) with Spock may be one of the most popular double episodes in the whole TNG franchise, certainly more popular than `Time's Arrow', Part I which ends this season with the possibility of something strange happening to Data on Earth. `The Masterpiece Society' shows what happens when a special genetically engineered race has contact from the outside world. Huge of Borg also makes his first appearance in `I, Borg'. Apart from the `Unification' double episode, the instalments `Ethics', about Worf undergoing a major controversial surgical operation and `The Game', when entertainment becomes mind control, have both achieved cult status as some of the best TNG episodes ever aired. Season Five unfortunately has some dull episodes too, many of which occur in the second half of the season, so the best stuff is within the first four discs. It doesn't really create much drive to push for a quick follow up with Season Six, but no doubt because Six is as good as Five was, then we are there for it. As a note: "Redemption part II" - this episode received as 12 age rating in the UK, because it contains Klingon ritual head butting. `Violations' also has sexually violent content (psychic rape). Parents may want to be cautious and view those two episodes before showing it to children. If you are going to move onto Season Six then you will probably want to know that during Season Six the crew make contact with Deep Space Nine. So if you get Deep Space Nice: Season One you can sync up the star dates and watch both franchises in chronological order. If you are in for Six you may also be in for Season One of DS9!

SEASON 6
Season 6 is generally considered the pinnacle of the series for the wind down to the Season 7 conclusion and of course the wake of popularity that Star Trek, Deep Space Nine: Season 1 whipped up while Season 6 was running. 1993 was TV Sci-Fi heaven with fans getting a double dose of ST for the year. This means for the folks who have been watching TOS and TNG, now is the time to do a special chronological order of star dates alternating between TNG Season 6 and DS9 Season 1. You can find the order if you search the new for it. TNG has really good stories while DS9 gets the effects. We are no longer happy to see a new interactive flat panel as the driving force of a story. Season 6 answers with substance to characters and stories with some surprises (Picard acting like a Russian is hysterical. Would you sacrifice his authority role for that quality humour from him from time to time? Maybe yes!). The conclusion of "Time's Arrow" is not the best cliff-hanger but sufficient. Most of the main characters from Season Two are here, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Commander William T. Riker, Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge, Lieutenant Commander Worf, Commander Deanna Troi, Lieutenant Commander Data and Dr. Beverly Crusher. Ensign Wesley Crusher (who departed from Season Four half way and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining seasons) returns for some episodes but is mainly replaced by the new Ensign Ro Laren, a Bajoran. Colm Meaney is here again as Miles Edward O'Brien but will be transferred to DS9 (his absence is not mentioned). Whoopi Goldberg's Guinan is back along with Alexander Rozhenko. Keiko O'Brien, (Miles O'Brien's wife) will also leave for DS9. Lieutenant Reginald Barclay, engineer is back after being absent from Season 5. Season 6 of TNG is mostly about transporter psychosis, empaths, Scotty!, alien abductions, Q, age regression, android dreams, artificial life, Cardassians, Prof. Moriarty, love, Romulan defection, destiny, Klingon birthrights, thieves, command ethics, origins of life, insanity, murder, faith, doubles, time travel and the Borg. Like Season 5 most the episodes in Season 6 have above average sci-fi stories, combing planetary exploration and the life of the crew. Memorable episodes include, A Fistful of Datas, The Quality of Life, Ship in a Bottle, Face of the Enemy, Birthright and lessons. There are three very good episodes which really make the season worth. Tapestry sees Picard given the opportunity to relive his youth without the night he fought with a gang who stabbed him through the heart. Suspicion is a great whodunit episode (of which there are a few) with one of the coolest Star Trek aliens ever (should have made him a main character). Descent Part I is a very nice slight of hand trick. You will keep thinking Hugh right up until the last second.

SEASON 7
Star Trek: Season 7 is of course winding down to a conclusion, making way for some Star Trek films, but in reality it is Deep Space Nine: Season 2 (DS9: Season 1 starts in star date chronological order with TNG: Season 6) that is the new trek. Fans of Star Trek got their twofold measure of these series through 1993 and 1994 making it an exceptional SF TV era. The conclusion of "Descent, Part II" has the finale of Lore. Most of the main characters from Season Two are here, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Commander William T. Riker, Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge, Lieutenant Commander Worf, Commander Deanna Troi, Lieutenant Commander Data and Dr. Beverly Crusher. Ensign Wesley Crusher (who departed from Season Four half way and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining seasons) returns for one episode. While Ensign Ro Laren, a Bajoran, was supposed to replace him, she only appears in one episode in Season 7, although the episode is a major one focused on her. Colm Meaney shows up again as Miles Edward O'Brien for the last episode. Whoopi Goldberg's Guinan is gone without explanation (see the movie "Star Trek: Nemesis" on her). Alexander Rozhenko is back. Keiko O'Brien, (Miles O'Brien's wife) is not here either (after leaving for DS9). Lieutenant Reginald Barclay, engineer, is back again. Season 6 of TNG is mostly about Lore, emotional studies, interfaces, mercenaries, nightmares, psychic trauma, Beverly and Picard, warp travel environmental damage, data's mother, alternate realities, the Pegasus, Worf's human brother, incubus, top secret missions, radiation sickness, deities, Troi and Worf, reverse evolution, Wesley and the Traveller, Klingon right of ascension, Picard's son, abiogenesis, Ro Laren and time travel. While there are some hit and miss episodes and a really terrible one ("Masks" for example is one of the worst of the entire franchise) most are well above average and some are incredible. Memorable episodes include, Gambit, Forces of Nature, Inheritance, Lower Decks, Thine Own Self, Journey's end and Bloodlines. The Pegasus is probably the best episode of the Season, but the finale "All good things..." is really where it is at with some good aging effects, a possible future with an older looking cast and an futuristic Enterprise to die for. The series ends very warmly and with a nicer note about the possibilities of looking within instead of charting stars and galaxies for a newer greater trek. In short there is nothing like ST:TNG. It evolved TV serials into mega media and ran for a full span of 7 years. It set a new benchmark and placed the bar as high as the stars. All we can say about this awe-inspiring series can be summed up in one word... 

...AMEN.

Filmed at New York's Improv in 1971, we see a young Pryor working on perfecting the kind of material that made him famous. More polished versions of some of these routines may be found on the 1971 album &quot;Craps After Hours.&quot; However, witness the powerful moment when he alludes to his mother's prostitution, then drops his head in sadness and takes a drag from his cigarette after realizing what he has just said. This scene alone is worth the price of admission in this important look at what was to come

Very entertaining movie. I enjoyed everything about this movie--- the acting, the humor, the singing and storyline!

Also being from San Diego originally, it was nice to see famous hotel and landmark, The Hotel Del Coronado, being used in this movie as the hotel in which the all girls band performed and stayed! No the hotel wasn't The Seminole Ritz in Florida!

I encourage anyone who enjoys Superman and wants to relive a bit of your childhood in fun-filled nostalgia, to purchase the entire series of the "Adventures of Superman" (played by George Reeves); the full set of all the episodes consists of 12 packed DVD's (I got mine all at once in a 3-pack collection, saving a little $$).  This is your chance to view the ENTIRE Superman TV series, from the first episode to the last (prematurely ending with the death of George Reeves)

We love underdogs! Here is a plain girl who finds happiness. There is ALOT more to this character than she is given credit for.

We've watched it about 20 times in the past 5 yrs. If you like "Ugly Betty" or any sort of Cinderella type stories - this one is for you. 

It is an Australian movie.

There can't be a better storyteller than Teddy Ruxpin. As I child I was enthralled with this animated story and would impatiently play with my toy Teddy Ruxpin as I waited for Saturday morning to come again so I could see another episode of the TV series. This show has a clear progression of plot development that starts right from episode one. So many cartoons are just one-shots, an individual small plot for each episode. Teddy Ruxpin was an epic adventure that caught you up and carried you along for a fantastic adventure! Along the way, kids learn important morals, values, and a lot about their own world. This is a fantastic cartoon to share with children of any age. And what a great price! Well worth it!

Millionaire Fredrick Loren played by a young Vincent Price invites five strangers to a party in the House On Haunted Hill. With his delectable wife Annabel in tow, he has set the strangers a task of sorts, if they can spend one night locked in the house he will give them $10,000 each, however there is a bit of a catch to this seemingly generous offer, the house has seen several brutal murders and is reputed to be haunted.

One of the guests in the house was even related to one of the victims and he is emphatic that the whole house is haunted and that they are all doomed because of what they are doing.

At midnight the door is locked and everyone in the house waits to see what will happen next, and very soon all are locked into a game of terror and murder as the House on Haunted Hill takes on a life of its own, but there is a twist in the tale that is deliciously surprising as it is fun.

I enjoyed this film, it wasn't overly suspenseful, but there are enough scenes to make you jump every now and then, the special effects were none-existent and there was a lot of screaming and shrieking from the character Norah a young woman who appears to be being targeted by the ghosts in the house.

All in all a hokum of a movie but great fun all the same.

If you're a fan of the show, these DVDs are a must have, period. Relive the good old days with the best show on television and order these--and all the other seasons--now!

This DVD teaches the history of Tai Chi, and the History of the 24 posture form and 48 posture form. It explains that these two Tai Chi forms were originally a martial art style, and that now they are usually done for health improvement. 

Then it shows the 24 posture form from the front, and the back, and with breathing instructions. Im not quite ready to try to coordinate my breathing with the movements, but when I am, this is a great guide. It then shows each of the 24 postures, and their original martial art applications, which helps you have a strong intent during the posture, and keeps your arms and legs in proper position. THEN, it teaches the 24 posture form, step by step, with very detailed instruction. This is a much more expanded version of this video by Master Liang than the original VHS. 

The DVD also shows the 48 posture form, which repeats several of the movements from the 24 posture form, and has other movements from other styles. 

It has absolutely helped me develop strength and balance in a few short weeks of practicing only the 24 posture form about 4 days a week on average. It has also improved my confidence, and people keep saying I have a glow about me. I just feel healthier, and happier too. 

This DVD is easy to learn from quickly. The Chinese bamboo flute music is nice. Oh, actually, my FAVORITE part is at the end, it shows a 'slideshow' of photos of the master, doing each posture move-by-move, with great music. I like to do my form along to this section, because it is a bit slower than the actual form, and you can exactly match your movements to the master. Its like having a one-on-one class with him. I find that this mimicing of his postures has helped me to learn more quickly. I remember the form now, without having to 'THINK', so I can try to turn my attention inward. 

A great DVD

Flying Down to Rio is the film that marks the first pairing of Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire. The two are not the main attraction though; the film stars Dolores del Rio and Gene Raymond in a tempestuous love affair. Raymond is a band leader who always falls for beautiful women. Del Rio is engaged to a man in Rio de Janeiro but secretly harbors feelings for the American. In a back and forth romance, the two occupy plenty of the film. The rest is taken by extravagant musical numbers including "I Like Music," "The Carioca," and "Orchids in the Moonlight" on top of a wonderful number that exhibits chorus girls dancing on top of airplanes!

The cast is good and the story is pretty standard, but it is the music that spices up the film. Definitly take a look at this movie, which is filled with inuendo only pre-code films could get away with and music only those early musicals featured

Jean Renoir's masterpiece, 'the grand illusion', is truly a film about humanity - it is a universal theme, something we can all understand and relate to. The triumph of the human spirit in the most troubled times, is kind of an ironic theme considering Hitler's imminent rise to power and the ensuing war that would alter the course of history. Nevertheless, Jean Renoir's poetic homage to brotherhood is one of his most beloved films. 
It is not hard to like this movie the acting and direction are superb - Jean Gabin is one of the all time great actors..
Jean Renoir's innovative approach would influence countless directors to come, including Orson Welles..
Criterion did a marvelous job on this dvd - also worth getting is 'the rules of the game' jean renoir's greatest satire

I loved the book and I feel that this movie did it justice.  The actresses are new favorites of mine, and I feel they really captured the spirit of the characters.  The movie really does a fantastic job of transporting viewers to 19th century England just as the book does.  I would definately recommend this movie and the book.

Maybe the most engaging documentary ever made. Brilliant style is used in telling the story of one of the giants of the movie industry, producer Robert Evans. Giving magical illumination and motion to still pictures in a way that I could only describe as psychedelic. 

Being a film fanatic for the last 43 years I was shocked and ashamed to find that I had not heard of Robert Evans. In all my reading of credits over the years I had somehow missed his name. I had remembered seeing William Castle's name at the beginning of Rosemary's Baby but not Evan's. Then, at finding out that he was the driving force behind Love Story, The Godfather, The Godfather Pt.2, Chinatown and one of my personal favorites The President's Analyst and that he was a big reason why those movies were so good, well I was just dumbfounded. And these are just a fraction of the films he's produced.

Of course he didn't start as a producer. He had been in women's apparel with his brother and accredited their endeavours as the reason why women wear pants today. While lounging around a pool one day he was discovered by Norma Shearer, lauching his career into show biz. It seems he knows everybody and I mean everybody.

After watchng this extraordinary film I called my father to ask him if he had ever heard of this astonishing personality. I queried, "Have you ever heard of Robert Evans?" anxiously awaiting a "No" so I could tell him all about this amazing show biz entity. He replied, "You mean Bob Evans." Yes indeed, it seems he knows EVERYBODY. My father had come across him in his days as a buyer for Macy's. I asked, "Do you know what he does now?" "He's some sort of movie director or something now, isn't he.", Dad answered. I bought him the audiobook. 

Evans narrates both the documentary and the audiobook, both which are drawn from his autobiograghy by the same name. His voice is almost as amazing as his story and probably greatly enabled his prowess. He also lent his voice to the short-lived, hysterically irreverent cartoon series Kid Notorious that still airs on Comedy Central.

All in all, whether you know Evans or not this is a fascinating, beautifully made film about a producer whose achievements are arguably greater than Thalberg's and Selznick's combined. The story of his life and loves is the stuff of legends and it goes on and on. This is a must see for anyone interested in Tinseltown. PS:I don't usually care for the added features but these are worthwhile and the credits to the main part of the documentary are alone worth the price of the disc. What a hoot and more proof that he knows everybody. Ask your dad. Who knows?

Seinfeld-Season 6 would see the sitcom finally hit #1 in the Nielsen ratings. This was also the season where the storylines became more complicated as Jerry, Elaine, George, and Kramer would all be involved in one caper or another in the same episode. George's parents, Frank and Estelle Costanza, as well as Jerry's parents, Morty and Helen Seinfeld, and Newman are featured more prominently and we also see the debut of several strong role players such as Mr. Pitt, David Puddy, and Kenny Bania. Amazingly, the storylines stayed strong throughout the season as several episodes would become classics. And while Jerry was usually considered the weakest of the four main actors, his work improved a lot during this season. 

Disc 1 starts the season out strong with the excellent episodes "The Big Salad" and "The Pledge Drive" as well as the hysterical classic, "The Couch." "The Chinese Woman" and "The Gymnast" are also very good episodes, both showing the continuing neuroses of the Costanzas. The sitcom always seems to have great episodes on Disc 2 and this is no exception with "The Soup", "The Switch", where we finally learn Kramer's first name, and "The Race" all being classic episodes. Disc 3 is also top notch, featuring the excellent "The Scofflaw", "The Kiss Hello", and "The Doorman", also known as "The Bro", as well as the two-part "Highlights of 100" episode. Disc 4 starts out with the classic episode "The Jimmy", which earned Michael Richards an Emmy for Best Supporting Actor, the excellent "The Fusili Jerry", and the strong season finale, "The Understudy", which mirrors the Tonya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan fiasco, only with Bette Midler, of all people, playing the victim. As usual, the extras are just as strong as the episodes. The Running With the Egg featurette that shows how an episode of Seinfeld is created is probably the best feature thus far in the Seinfeld series. The bloopers are also very funny from this season, especially the ones from "The Fusili Jerry" episode. The deleted scenes, inside looks, exclusive stand-up material, and the Notes About Nothing are also top notch. Although not quite on the level of Season 4, which was their best season, Season 6 was another great season for Seinfeld as the writing was still top notch and the ensemble cast was running on all cylinders. Highly recommended.

&quot;Monkey Business&quot; looks pretty good on DVD 50 years later.  The restoration comparison on the DVD shows the change the restoration brought, a bit darkly tinted, and more defined.  The wild plot keeps you glued to the screen throughout.  Marilyn Monroe who is the star on the DVD box has more of a supporting role here.  She is great as the secretary Lois Laurel who shows up early because the boss doesn't like her punctuation.  Cary Grant as the addled Professor Barnaby Fulton turns in a great journeyman performance, getting appropriately loony when experiencing the euphoria of youth.  His driving sequence with Monroe had me turning in my chair with laughter to avoid the trucks!  Ginger Rogers as wife Edwina gets pretty wacky when returned to youth.  If all youth were as lighthearted as these comedic versions, it'd be a laugh and guffaw every time the school bell rings.  Hugh Marlowe as the straight-laced attorney Hank Entwhistle does a nice job of standing stoic during the crazy Indian game.  Oscar winner Charles Coburn (1943, The More the Merrier) does a great job of appreciating Monroe's assets as Oliver Oxly, the CEO.  Kathleen Freeman as Mrs. Brannigan gives a fine performance. The DVD offers perviews of many Monroe films.  This is a great little piece of cinematic history.  Turn back the clock &amp; enjoy

I owned the VHS version of ''The Wild,Wild World'' but decided to get the DVD this winter.
WELL..That was a great purchase !
I understand people that could see the documentary of Jayne in Europe,as pretty cheaply made,BUT it is still Jayne,and if you love her (as I do),any film she was in (except The Girl can't help it,and Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter) was done on the cheap,with ridiculously small budgets.
'The Wild,Wild World' gives you the chance to see a candid Jayne in all kinds of very campy situations,and the best scenes are when Jayne pretends to be offended by the goings-on...
It shows a Jayne Mansfield who was indeed a true-original,rather eccentric person in the anal-retentive American Fifties.I can't help comparing her to what Anna Nicole Smith has done with her 'career' as a media sensation,BUT Jayne was doing basically the same FIFTY years ago,which was understandbly much more shocking for the common-folks.
When Jayne talks about her film roles,you wonder if she is laughing with you or at herself.
I don't understand how she can be compared to Marilyn Monroe.MM was looking for privacy,more serious roles,spoke to journalists only if she absolutely had to,when Jayne was waking up her daughter in the middle of the night to prepare drinks for journalists who needed something to write about.Jayne was not too picky about her roles,and the kind of attention she was getting,and it was her undoing.Sad,but she needed the money to keep up that image,all those children,dogs,and...husbands.
NOW ,about ''The Labyrinth of Sex'': It is HYSTERICAL !! and a great choice to make the DVD a double-feature,just like the good-old days of the Drive-ins !
When you get over the awful dubbing,the documentary is rather well made,naive to today's standards of course,but well-intentionned.Some viewers will just see crass-exploitation,but if you are into Campy,Kitsch movies,and you see Ed Wood Jr. as a genius...well you will love IT !.The movie trailers are very funny as well,and make you wish you could find them.
So my conclusion is that DVD is an EXCELLENT purchase,a must-have for any serious Jayne Mansfield Fan !!

I read over some of the other people's opinions regarding this movie and cannot agree with them about it.  My kids ages 6 & 2 loved this movie from start to finish.  The music, the characters, and the story were great for the entire family.  I definitely recommend this movie for your family's movie collection

The musical was a virtual voyage back to my childhood when I saw it for the first time. My husband is no "square" and he enjoyed it all. Seniors would love to see it again.  The film was obviously preserved well and the color was enriched beautifully for this dvd

This was a delightful view into the highs and lows of courtship, love, jealousy, and hate and what havoc can be wrought by schemes devised to satisfy emotional turmoil. With the lovely backdrop of Italy, all is well that ends well for the characters. Michael Keaton as comic relief is brilliant.

Arturo Bandini (Colin Farrell) arrives from Colorado to Los Angeles. He is an aspiring writer who is getting down to his last nickel. He prays for inspiration to find another interesting story to write.  He meets a mexican waitress, Camilla (Salma Hayek) in a cafe and they just don't like each other, or do they?
  Finally Auturo hits the mother lode. A letter he wrote has been changed into a short story for publishing along with a handsome paycheck.  It is just enough for him to buy a new suit outfit, a few suppers and pay the rent for a while.
  Arturo is a very well mannered man, but keeps meeting these strange characters that get him all wrong.
  Plays like film noir. The cinematography of 1934 Los Angeles is wonderful.
  Colin Farrell and Salma Hayek in the moonlit ocean was breathtaking.
  Colin Farrell perfected his American accent.
  Very tastefully down skinny-dipping scenes and beautiful to watch.
  AH! Give Colin a break. The water was cold.

DVD includes Audio commentary, making of..., theatrical trailer

I really forgot how good some of those first season early episodes were until I bought the season 1 DVD. "Skin Deep" is probably the most entertaining episode of the series. Other standouts are "China Doll" and "J "Digger" Doyle". What I enjoyed most was the 1982 crossover episode as the featuring Gerald McRaney and Jamison Parker from Simon and Simon from season 2. Also the Simon episode "Emeralds are a girls best friend" and although not as big a fan of later seasons, the 2 part season 5 opener w/ a young unknown Sharon Stone playing a psycho...big surprise there. I found it neat with the discoesque theme song for the first 10 episodes too. You could see how the 4 main characters found their niche as the season progressed

Briefly speaking,


If you liked Tony Jaa in "Ong-Bak " you'll love 
"The Protector." The plots are cut from the 
same mold (in this movie, Jaa attempts 
to recover elephants, instead of a statue head, 
that were stolen from his village by ruthless criminals). 
The choreography is faster paced 
and more dynamic (and there's more of it!); 
once again showcasing Jaa's fantastic 
martial arts ability.  Since the script 
and the acting are not on the high end of 
the cinema achievement scale, the producers 
were smart to put the emphasis on mindboggling 
stunts and martial arts choreography.

This movie is great. I hope I'm not placing a 
jinx by saying Tony Jaa is destined to become
a legend. He is the greatest martial artist
we've seen on screen in many years.

I saw this THAI horror film about 3 years ago. I have to say this is the best supernatural thriller made from Thailand, and I have seen a fair share of them(Nang nak, the sisters, mae nak, art of the devil series).

The film focuses on Tun and his girlfriend Jane. Tun, a photographer reunites with his old friends. On the way home, they accidentally hit a girl with their car and from then on, Tun sees ghostly apparitions whenever he takes pictures or whenever he tries to develop them.  Ok, I am not spoiling anything, the story is more complex than it sounds. Tun and his friends have a past that catches up to them, with Jane caught in the middle. As usual, there is a vengeful spirit going around killing people. "Shutter" refers to his camera and what it represents. "Sometimes the dead cannot let go of their loved ones.." I'm stopping here, I don't want to give out anymore.

The plot is not that complex, but believe me when I say, the film is well-made. It does a great job of putting things together, each shocking scene is linked to the past and the present. I didn't see any scene wasted and it has that very atmospheric, creepy feel to it.  Also, there is a scene in the movie that Tun and Jane looked at ACTUAL photos of ghostly apparitions in a polaroid. 

Honestly, this film has some great scenes that can make the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end the very first time you watch it and the "shock ending" has the greatest twist of any horror flick I've seen! I've seen a lot of horror films, only THE EXORCIST and THE OMEN ever scared/creeped me out, and SHUTTER came very close. My female friends were scared out of their wits when they saw it at my place.

Since I haven't seen the TARTAN release and I only own the region-3 DTS-ES rlease from PanMedia (Hong Kong)but Tartan usually uses the same transfers from either the HONG KONG or KOREAN versions. The video is sufficient, with some dark and bright contrast. It is not free of grain but it does add to the atmospheric feel. the DTS soundtrack is great though, very crisp and loud. The english subtitles are excellent, the Thai language track is the only way to watch as it was meant to be seen.

A DEFINITE must-see if you are a fan of ASIAN HORROR or horror films in general. It rivals RINGU, ONE MISSED CALL and the original JU-ON 1 and 2.
FOUR AND 1/2 STARS!

For those reviewers who have not seen the remakes, see DAIL M FOR MURDER by Alfred Hitchcock, PERFECT MURDER starring Michael Douglas and Gyneth Paltrow, not to mention countless TV movies of the week.

This is the original and the best.Barbara Stanwyck is superb, as is Burt Lancaster. Moody and dark and suspenseful.

I found I did enjoy this movie, even though the director took liberties. It doesn't follow so much the novel by Jane Austen, but if you haven't read the book and are unable to do the comparisons, this movie is enjoyable. I gave 4 stars because of the liberties taken by the director, but did like what I saw

I mean that statement in two ways. First, in my humble opinion, this is Martin Scorcese at his finest. This is better than Goodfellas by a wide margin. All of the regulars give awesome performances in this (even Sharon Stone, who I can't stand!). If you like mafia pictures, this is the BEST one to own. I also mean that it's a great picture due to the fact that it's on HD-DVD. The picture is astonishingly vivid and clear and the lights of Las Vegas really jump out of the television. It's almost 3-D ! The extras are ample, but I'd say adequate. That's the reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5. There is the obligitory commentary, deleted scenes, and a couple featurettes. It's all whipped cream and a cherry on top of an excellent sundae ! I do like that you can watch the extras and the movie at the same time with commentary running. This and Batman Begins are the reasons you should own an HD DVD player ! Note: I have the HD DVD drive attached to my Xbox 360 and it works brilliantly !

Every time this movie comes on my husband (who is English) and I watch it and laugh our heads off.If you have ever been in an English train station,drinking weak,watery cups of tea out of dirty,cracked cups.Smelling mildew and stale cigarettes while you freeze to death you would see the humor in anyone being romantically moved while sitting there.And not to be crule,but these are not exactly a couple of sex-pots.The thought of two stodgy old English people being driven wild by their passion for each other is,well------------------ hilarious! I give it 5 stars for being so darn funny.Oh--- and the music---- PLEASE!!!!!!!!!! But it is worth watching for a good laugh

Director:  Denzel Washington
Cast:  Denzel Washington, Derek Luke, Joy Bryant, Salli Richardson, Malcolm David Kelley, Cody Hodges, Leonard Earl Howze, Novella Nelson.
Running Time:  120 minutes
Rated PG-13 for violence, language and mature thematic material involving child abuse.

Based on a true story, and with a screenplay written by the eponymous hero from his own book, "Antwone Fisher" is at heart a study of psychological disturbance, laced with reasonable amounts of Hollywood sugar and optimism about the human spirit. It's a peculiarly American medicine, swallowed less willingly in some markets than others, which probably explains why criticism of the film often confused Denzel Washington's directorial talents (which are generally good) with the various workings of his film's plot, which can be argued about.  Antwone Fisher's story starts in the navy, where after a particularly vivid nightmare he slugs a fellow shipmate, and is hauled up before the Captain. Sent to navy psychiatrist Jerome Davenport (Washington), he begins to work out issues of anger that, it turns out, stem from an abused childhood to which is added a guilt complex over a dead friend. At the same time Fisher (played exceptionally well by newcomer Derek Luke), struggles to establish a first adult romantic relationship with the inviting Cheryl (Joy Bryant). In a parallel plot thread, Washington's character, the ever-reasonable Dr. Davenport, is having marital problems. In due course we discover that he has things to learn about communicating too and Fisher is a catalyst for his own change. 

Fisher's screenplay reached the cameras by a somewhat circuitous route: after his stint in the navy and with little writing experience, he was hired by a Sony executive to write his own story - a process which apparently underwent over 40 drafts before it was acceptable. Most of the weaknesses of the film can be traced to the uncertainties he brings to his new craft, although Washington's direction papers reasonably well over many cracks. The most unconvincing elements are those subplots that revolve around the main character. These include the psychiatrist's ironic domestic problems, as well as Fisher's tentative love life. One is tempted to see these narrative distractions as rather manipulative bolt-on elements, leavening the appeal of a central, harrowing, personal history. The Fisher - Cheryl romance for instance, while in context necessarily clumsy, is also ultimately gauche. And once consummated, it is left to languish without further comment, as if further exploration of this side to Fisher's maturing was unnecessary.  Perhaps sensing this central weakness, Fisher's script introduces another element into the young African-American's tortured life as a foster child. During flashbacks he has to deal with 'slave-nation' justifications from Mrs. Tate (Novella Nelson), suggesting a link between the hurt done to the individual and that presumably done to the whole black race - a reasoning which is frankly unconvincing and none too interesting. Significantly, such issues are given short shrift by the psychiatrist himself, and soon disappear from view. On the plus side is the central performance by Derek Luke as the hero, a perfectly judged acting job, that neatly balances inner rage and confusion - "I don't know what to do" - with lack of self-pity. Washington's role is also well done. Given the difficulty of the actor-director role, he is to be applauded for carrying off both so effectively and without fuss, either in front or behind the camera. 

This is Washington's directorial debut and he does an admirable job of painting a thorough picture of Antwone and even though the film could have benefited from some tighter editing, it's still a film that delivers all the emotional goods. Arguably the most impressive thing about this film is the casting of Luke who was a total unknown actor with a mere handful of television credits to his resume and obviously Washington knew he possessed the right goods to pull off the role. Despite its flaws, "Antwone Fisher" is an intriguing look into the real life of an estranged, enigmatic individual; it is a film that will stimulate the heart and make you wish that small children didn't have to endure such horrors.

My first favorite television series was "Twelve O'Clock High" and I had at least two models of the "Memphis Belle" when I was kid, all of which simply reflects the fact that the B-17 Flying Fortress is my favorite airplane.  When I was a kid my family was driving through California and there was a B-17 parked out on somebody's front lawn on a ranch and for years I tried to figure out how to go back and see it.  A couple of decades later one of the few B-17s still flying came to the Zenith City and I finally got to go inside one (this big bombers are a lot smaller than I ever thought).  For all I know that particular B-17 ended up flying in the 1990 film "Memphis Belle."  When I had occasion to drive through the city of Memphis, of course I made a point of visiting Mud Island where the "Memphis Belle" was on display (she was moved to the Air Force Museum in Dayton, Ohio this October).

The "Memphis Belle" (Serial No. 41-24485) was one of 12,750 B-17 Flying Fortresses built by the Boeing Aircraft Company, but it was the most famous because it was the first heavy bomber to complete 25 combat missions over Hitler's Europe without losing a crew member.  The idea of 25 missions and going home was established by the bomber command as an incentive for air crews because morale was desperately low after the first three months of American combat flights over Europe during which eighty percent of the planes were shot down.  The "Belle" flew from November 7, 1942 to May 17, 1943 and its final flight is the fanciful subject of this film directed by Michael Caton-Jones ("Scandal") from the script by Monte Merrick ("Staying Together").  

That simply means that besides the fact that the "Memphis Belle" was named for a lady friend (Margaret Polk) of the pilot and that the art on the nose depicting the same (designed by the famous artist George Petty) there is nothing here that is historically accurate when it comes to that final mission, which was over Lorient, France and not Bremen, Germany (the "Belle" flew there on its 21st mission).  The names of the crew are all changed and I think the same applies to the plane's mascot, a Scotty Dog named "Stuka."  So if you want something closer to the "true" story of the pilot Robert Morgan and the "Memphis Belle" you want to check out William Wyler's 1944 documentary "The Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress."

What you have here instead is a Hollywood movie that celebrates the men who flew these bombers in World War II by incorporating a wide variety of clichés from war movies involving airplanes.  Then there is the whole idea that Americans from all walks of life who have little in common besides a desire to get home alive band together to fight the Nazis.  So it is we have the young and recognizable faces of Matthew Modine as the business like pilot, Eric Stoltz as the poetic radio operator, Tate Donovan as the co-pilot who wants to actually do something before he goes home, D.B. Sweeney as the navigator who is convinced his number is up, Billy Zane as the bombardier who left medical school to fight, Sean Austin as the runt who is stuck in the ball turret, Reed Edward Diamond as the flight engineer, Courtney Gains and Neil Giuntoli as the bickering waist gunners, and Harry Connick as tail gunner and sometime crooner.  

Back at the base David Strathairn plays the commanding officer nervous about his boys getting back alive and John Lithgow is the public relations officer the Army has sent  to celebrate the final mission of the "Belle."  Of course, it is hard to create tension given that most viewers know the "Memphis Belle" is remembered for completing that final mission, so any tension that is created tends to be somewhat artificial although there are some nice moments during the bomb run (the film might play better if it simply inspired by the "Belle" and they changed the name of the aircraft as well) .  But even if the "Belle" survives there are other several B-17 crews on the mission who will not.  Still, the idea that doing your duty could not just be dangerous but be outright suicidal is communicated, allowing Modine's character to explain the job to his nervous crew and underscore that Americans do not believe in collateral damage.  But what will probably stand out in this film is the grim lesson that Donovan's character learns when he tries to be a hero by doing somebody else's job.

I enjoyed this movie a lot. Hugh Jackman and Ashley Judd are both very appealing in these roles, and Greg Kinnear does a nice job with his as well - the jerk who's just so charming that you can't resist, even when you know better than to fall for it. Ellen Barkin does fine with her small role but it is weird that she is the one listed first

I thank the creators of this film which took me back to the days of growing up in Detroit.  All the time time I was learning every new Motown song and every new dance step to go with the newest hits, I had no knowledge of the Funk Brothers. I grew up on Detroit's "North End" and a lot of the Motown stars came from this area. I connected to the film immediately when it opened to snow-covered English tudor homes on Detroit's Northwest side. The film has wonderful themes: fame, success, heartbreak, the beauty of friendship among musicians, failure to be recognized, recognition much too late, and attempts of redemption, if not apology. I think the whole city of Detroit, or at least my part of it, was heartbroken with the news that Motown was moving to Los Angeles. In the film the musicians are given their due, a la their Cubano brothers and sisters in "Buena Vista Social Club.

This is one of the best (if not THE best) pure screwball comedies of the 1930's. Next to the original Thin Man movie, Libeled Lady is my favorite Powell/Loy effort. This time, the magic chemistry of that oft-paired duo is enhanced by the box office-drawing talents of fellow mega-stars Spencer Tracy and Jean Harlow. The first shot of the movie celebrates this happy collaboration as the four top-drawer actors merrily, confidently stride arm-in-arm toward the camera. 

The plot is convoluted. The Star has erroneously printed a story about heiress Connie Allenbury (Myrna Loy), portraying her as a marriage wrecker. Connie immediately files a 5 million dollar libel suit. Star newspaper editor Warren Haggerty (Spencer Tracy) counteracts by hiring on suave fellow newspaperman Bill Chandler (William Powell) to romance Connie and place her in a compromising position, thus negating the lawsuit. Haggerty convinces his harried, long-suffering fiancee Gladys Benton (Jean Harlow) to instead marry the bachelor Chandler as part of the scheme.  Things get really tricky when Gladys falls for Chandler and Chandler falls for Connie, who eventually falls for Chandler. And Haggerty? He pretty much spends the movie just seething. Yet everything ends fairly well, even if there's still lingering confusion as to who is exactly married to whom. 

Libeled Lady boasts mix-ups and complications galore and couples matching, cross-matching and mismatching. Sophisticated wit blends with full blown physical comedy. Delicious acting is laid in by four stars who, throughout their film careers, never ever lost their prime. Powell proves again his mastery of the confused double-take and, along with the wry, understated Myrna Loy, dominates the refined repartees. And representing the more lowbrow couple, Tracy supplies the blue collar bluster and Harlow the affronted looks. Walter Connolly as Connie's angling-loving father is simply wonderful. The intricate storyline is easy to follow, thanks to the clear helmsmanship of Jack Conway. With this cinematic venture, Hollywood certainly offered up to the viewing audience its most glamorous and most urbane of stars. I think it's brilliant stuff

"QUINCEANERA"

Happy Birthday???


Amos Lassen and Literary Pride

One of the great Mexican tardyons is celebrated by the new movie "Quinceanera", a traditional rite of passage. It takes place to signify that fifteen year old girls enter the world of womanhood. Magdalena (Emily Rios) is preparing for her party when the movie opens but she has a secret--she is pregnant. She was raised a devout Catholic girl and the fact that she is "with child" shames her conservative parents and they retaliate by ostracizing her. Distraught by her banishment from her family, Magdalena turns to her Uncle Tomas (Chalo Gonzales) who lives with her cousin, Carlos (Jesse Garcia) in a small apartment in Echo Park, Los Angeles. Carlos is open with her about his being gay and is being wooed by a new male couple which has moved into the neighborhood. What results is a ménage a trios between Carlos and the couple, one a television producer and the other a British citizen. Carlos bonds emotionally with one of the men and the situation becomes sticky and it jeopardizes Magdalena's new family unit.
	In effect the movie takes a careful look at class differences and in doing so looks at the gay characters involved as flawed and it is obvious that Carlos is little more than a sexual pastime for the couple of upper-middle class men. What results is a highly emotional drama that we do not see often in American films but that foreign films seem to have a knack for dealing with.
	Performances are excellent in the film and the directors Richard Glatzner and Wash Westmoreland give us a fresh new look on the gay cinema screen. Emily Rios is a charismatic young actress of whom we shall undoubtedly hear more and Chalo Gonzalez as Uncle Tomas gives a performance not easily forgotten. He is warm and laden with emotion that glows in his portrayal.
	Everything about this movie is fine, the script, the actors, the photography and the open description of sexuality as well as the sincerity and the love with which it was made.
	Awarded several prizes such as the dramatic audience and jury prizes at the 2006 Sundance Festival, "Quinceanera" is a marvelous film--especially because it wears its queerness so well, the gay it balances both gay and straight story lines and the way it deals with such important issues as sexuality, maturation, culture clashes and love.
Simply put this is an amazing film and should not be missed.

I love Dancehall Queen!  I lost my first copy (VHS) so I replaced it with a new copy in DVD.  I never get tired of watching this movie and I consider it a Jamaican movie classic right up there with Harder They Come, Rockers and Smile Orange.  It is a nice twist on the traditional rags-to-riches story.  Although her character's morals are somewhat questionable (she practically "sells" her daughter to a high-paying local don), you can't help but root for the protagonist Marcia

This exhilarating musical comedy, featuring (respectively) the fancy footwork and infectious crooning of GIs Kelly and Sinatra, perfectly captures the optimistic spirit that held sway in the post-World War II boom. Co-starring dancers Vera-Ellen and Ann Miller, "On the Town" was one of the first color films shot on location in Manhattan, and remains one of the grandest, liveliest Hollywood musicals ever made.

This is one of the best movies starring children I have ever seen - Ozu embraces their viewpoint - often litterally from their eye level. Often in other Ozu films like 'Tokyo Story', and 'Early Summer' - we would see flashes of children from a strikingly noncondescending and, often times, humerous perspective. Now in 'Good Morning' we have an almost entire film devoted to childhood - and events that are important in the lives of these kids and their parents and family. Like all Ozu films it is gorgeously shot and in a bright colorful style full of wonderfull compositions. It is not as masterul as 'Tokyo Story' of 'Floating Weeds' - but it gives us a better understanding of Ozu and how he saw the world - very charming film

Though this movie is not the stage version, it is just as good!
Bill Benson(Bing Crosby) and Ted Adams (Donald O Conner) decide to do a broadway show together. However, they need a leading lady. Well Ted and the director decide that if Bill should run across the right girl, sign her. So Bill sets off to Paris, and Ted for London. Well Bill discovers a girl(Mitzy Gaynor) not knowing that Ted found and signed a girl in Paris (Jeanmaire).
When the two find out it is total chaos, especially trying to keep the two girls from finding out about eachother on the way home. All the while trying to get the other to tell their girl to leave. Things seem to be going fine, until the two men begin to fall in love with eachothers leading lady! 
The movie has GREAT Porter songs De Lovely, Anything Goes, Second Hand Turban, Blow Gabe Blow, I get a kick out of you, You're the Top, and a fabulous tap number with Donald: You Can Bounce Right Back. Phil Harris also stars in this fantastic, De Lovely movie!!

Kaufman Lends Surprising Humanism to an Exceptional Mind-Bending Story of Loss and Regret

Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's reality-bending work has become such a Hollywood staple that he is becoming more distinctive than the directors who give life to his wildly imaginative and solipsistic scripts. He dares to give dramatic form to nebulous psychological states that border on horror stories. Directed by Michel Gondry, this 2004 study in love and loss is no exception, as Kaufman takes the notion of a struggling relationship and inverts it into a manic piece of science fiction involving a medical procedure to scrub one's memory. At the same time, Gondry and Kaufman have injected a strong dose of humanism into this film by grounding it with characters that are relatable as much as they are quirky.

The labyrinth plot focuses on shy, taciturn Joel Barish, who is swept off his feet by the raucous, unstable Clementine. Much to his dismay after a particularly ugly fight, he discovers that Clementine has impulsively decided to erase all memory of her relationship with him through a medical company called Lacuna headed by the benevolent Dr. Mierzwiak. A renowned leader in his field of memory erasure, Mierzwiak treats the heartbroken Joel to the same procedure as Clementine's. However, Joel is overcome by the intensity of emotion from this act of reciprocation and starts rebelling against the deep consciousness treatment to regain his memories of Clementine. The surreal twists and turns that occur boggle the mind of the viewer but not in a way that alienates us from Joel's plight.

It helps that a sturdy cast has been recruited starting with a surprisingly subdued Jim Carrey as the depressed Joel. This is easily his most effective attempt at a straight dramatic role even though Gondry allows him to provide flashes of his manic personality when appropriate. Displaying no trace of her corseted Britishness as the bedraggled free spirit Clementine, Kate Winslet shows the right level of abandon and leavens it with her natural earthiness. Tom Wilkinson is his usual steady self as the somewhat remorseful Mierzwiak, while his spirited trio of assistants is played with relish by Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood. All three are fine with Dunst particularly affecting toward the end.

The looping narrative could have spiraled out of control had it not been for the stellar work by cinematographer Ellen Kuras, production designer Dan Leigh and editor Valdis Oskarsdottir, all combining to bring much-needed fluidity to initially incoherent scenes. The only fly in the ointment is Jon Brion's overly intrusive music. The 2004 DVD has several extras, the best of which is the consistently informative commentary track by Gondry and Kaufman, which helps explain some of the more bizarre plot turns. There are two featurettes - a standard ten-minute making-of short and a fifteen-minute conversation with Gondry and Carrey that borders on banal. Seven minutes of understandably excised scenes are included, as well as a creative music video of The Polyphonic Spree's "Night and Day" and a faux-commercial for Lacuna

Truth be told, I should probably give this film only four stars because it does take a while to really get going and I think some of the story elements could have been presented more effectively.  When this thing gets going, though, The Descent easily attains not-to-be-missed status, and on top of all the incredible special effects, oppressive atmosphere, and grievous bloodletting (made with a pretty limited budget, by the way), one of the most important plot points of the story is actually brought home in an impressively subtle manner.  Are you kidding me?  Blood, gore, a claustrophobic atmosphere like you wouldn't believe - and subtlety?  How could I not give The Descent five stars?

So you've got these young British women who like to get together once a year and engage in some sort of risky, extreme activity.  White water rafting, for example.  Everyone has fun, but then a horrible automobile accident changes the life of one of the women, Sarah (Shauna MacDonald), forever.  Still recovering from her terrible loss, Sarah joins her friend Beth (Alex Reid) in America, where mutual friend Juno (Natalie Mendoza), an Alpha Female if there ever was one, has staked out a cave system just begging to be explored.  Joining in the fun are Holly (Nora-Jane Noone), Juno's new gung-ho sidekick, and a couple of sisters who round out the spelunking sextet.  

The movie drags a good bit as we sit and watch the girls arrive at their destination in the Appalachians (apparently somewhere in the North Carolina mountains - although the movie was filmed entirely in the UK), then do their bonding thing the night before the big adventure.  Once they descend into the cave system, though, things start getting more intense fairly quickly.  Their first real move down into the complex of cave structures turns into quite a tight and claustrophobic ordeal, especially for Sarah who gets stuck and is barely pulled to safety before the tunnel collapses.  That's when Juno, a woman with more than her fair share of secrets, admits that she has led the girls into a cave system that has never been explored before, supposedly to help reunite the group.  Well, it does just the opposite, but they just have to keep going.  If there is a way out, they're going to have to find it the hard way.

Things are already creepy enough at this point.  The filmmakers did an incredible job with the sets, making the viewer feel as if he/she is trapped in a real cave system with the characters.  Just watching these girls pull their bodies through extremely tight, dark spaces was enough to get me feeling pretty darn claustrophobic.  But the real fun was just about to begin.  In the wake of one of the most realistic compound leg fracture scenes you'll ever want to squirm through, Sarah spots the presence of someone or something else down there with them.  No one believes her - at first.  When the "crawlers" attack, though, all hell breaks loose two miles under ground.  These Gollum-like creatures are some kind of blind, albino humanoids who hunt by sound, can scamper and climb like monkeys, move unbelievably quickly, and really tear into whatever flesh they can find.  Not only are they frighteningly impressive in and of themselves, the filmmakers present them in the most effective of cinematic light.  And when the girls fight back, it's cinematic magic as the filmmakers hold nothing back in the creepy, bloody, gruesome department.  And even as characters are fighting for their lives, a personal bombshell or two also drops to ratchet up the frenetic drama level even higher.  

The ending is a little controversial because American theatrical audiences didn't get to see the true final scene of the film, for some pretty questionable reasons.  A few seconds can and do make a pretty big difference.  Don't worry, though, as the DVD has both endings available.

The Descent draws deeply from the well of man's most instinctual fears, making it one of the most atmospheric, heart-pounding movies to come along in quite a while.  The subtlety of the story in terms of the relationship between Sarah and Juno is almost as impressive as the cinematography and sound work - and it even leaves room for an alternate explanation of everything that happens here.  The Descent has everything you could ever ask for in a horror film - and plenty more on top of that.  If you care the first thing about horror, you must see this atmospheric tour de force

Well, at least she does for my 3 and a half year old daughter.  Each episode is compact with a simple theme covering the whole educational gambet.  Beware, the theme song may start to make adults twitch after a while.  The DVD has a different narrator than the original (Neal Morrissey) videos, but all in all a good viewing for the under 5s

Mathau and Lemon are very funny and no wonder they continued to make other movies together like "Grumpy Old Men." The plot line is straighforward but their acting and character sketch makes it truly entertaining and captures their classic relationship.

This would be a steal at twice the price.  I don't know what possessed Spike Lee to offer five of his best movies at such a low price.  Do the Right Thing is a brilliant movie, capturing both the rhythms and tensions of Lee's beloved Brooklyn, which he would return to time and again.  Lee is at his best when avoiding the polemics and sticking to character-driven movies.  Jungle Fever and Mo' Better Blues stand out in this regard, because they are first and foremost about people.  Jungle Fever introduced the great Samuel L. Jackson, as well as launched Wesley Snipes in an intense social drama which revolves around an inter-racial love affair.  Jackson stole most of the scenes however as the drug-addled brother who simply couldn't get his act straight no matter how hard he tried.  Mo' Better Blues exposed Lee's love for jazz.  Moody and atmospheric, with Denzel Washington delivering a solid performance, the film tries to recapture the spirit of the Harlem Renaissance.  Clockers was his crime drama with plenty of tension. Crooklyn revolved mostly around amusing family disputes, with Alfre Woodard as a strong mother figure.  It was probably the least satisfying of the five, but fun to watch just the same.  Lee embelishes his movies with such rich cinematic color, and offers numerous fascinating camera angles such as his now famous walking scenes in Jungle Fever.  Not since Gordon Parks, had someone done so much for black cinema, rescuing it from the blaxploitation films of the 70's

This was purchased for my daughter for her 15th Birthday.  She is very deeply interested in Shakespeare and all his works but especially Romeo and Juliet.  I saw this version when it was released originally in theaters and wanted her to have the experience of seeing these 2 actors.  I thought it was beautifully done then and she loves it now.  Impressive that Mom and daughter enjoy this movie when the music of today's teens and much of their other interests are definitely not Mom's thing.

This movie is all about entertaining.The combination between "Die Hard" and typical martial arts flick works in many levels, but the production values are Hong Kong`s, don`t miss that point.Fans of Jet Li are welcome, but action fans be careful. Here we can find scale helicopters burst in flames, exploding building models, chopped off dummies, you name it. The characters are extreme in their own context: Jet Li is a former military now becomed bodygard and stunt actor, loyal, gentleman, honorable, deadly, you know, a portrait of the typical good guy. The bad guys are also extremely violent and cool looking. He doesn't fight or kick much in this film, but he shoots a lot, dodging bullets from a dozen bad guys with machine guns with no scratch at all, his revolver shoots 30 bullets without reloading, he drives a car inside a hall and uses the elevator, that happens to be be the right size...
Well, you have to be in the right mood to watch this film without laughing at the many cartoonish production mistakes. But if you are into Hong Kong low production values action films, you will really enjoy one of the best ones of the 90`s.

By the way, this DVD edition sucks. English dubbed, subtitles, poor sound and no extras, not even a filmography

Very few people remember Sandra Bullock starring on the short-lived CBS sitcom Working Girl which was based on the 1988 20th Century Fox film of the same title starring Harrison Ford,Melanie Griffith and Sigourney Weaver. Very few remember Bullock's appearance in the 1991 film LOVE POTION #9. This film catapulted her to superstardom. She stars opposite Keanu Reeves and all hell breaks loose with both of them recklessly driving commercial buses. In the twelve years since this film debuted on the big screen,Bullock relentlessly made films to this very day. Also back in 1994,Hollywood had another megastar,Jim Carrey whose starring debut ACE VENTURA-PET DETECTIVE grossed over $5 million at the box office. Unfortunately,SPEED 2,released in 1997,never acuumulated audiences as large as the ones who saw the first film

Both movies are great, each one of them has it's own charm.
Ashley Judd shows she is a great comedian, and Hugh Jackman is one of the best actors of his generation.  The movie is soo funny...it shows what we women are like when a man breaks up with us, and that love is where you least expect it.
As for Brown Sugar, it's very sweet, entertaining and funny to watch. I didn't know the actors of this movie and they are amazing. Perhaps love is next door

The most in glamour , gams and optimism , in short it would be like ZIEGFELD FOLLIES . With a whos who of credited and uncredited Hollywood talents , this all-star revue is heaven to fans of musicals . Fred Astaire (1899-1987) dazzle once , twice..four numbers in all . Red Skelton (1913-1997) reprises his funny Guzzlers Gin skit . Esther Williams (1922 - ) swims , Lena Horne (1917 - ) sings and Judy Garland (1922 -1969) spoofs snobbery , theres  verdi ( Giuseppe F.

This is an O.K movie. I give it a 3.5. It starts out with the origin of Mewtwo, as using DNA from the legendary Pokemon Mew's eyebrow fossil to create a clone, Mewtwo. Soon, Team Rocket leader Giovanni tries to control Mewtwo after he destroys the lab from which he was born in, but Mewtwo has other plans, thinking his purpose is not to serve humans. So he invites the most powerful Pokemon trainers to the New Island to see who can stand up to him. But things get outta control when Mewtwo steals all the Pokemon in black Pokeballs and creates artificial "Super-Clones" to prove that clones are the strongest in the universe. But he didn't count on Ash, a young Pokemon Trainer. Ash destroys the cloning machine, thus bringing Mew to the scene and saving the captured Pokemon. Who'll win? The superclones or the originals? Mew or Mewtwo? You've got to see it to beleive it

I have very fond memories of this short lived Irwin Allen classic.The picture and sound on the dvd's is better than i remember.The video transfer is very nice and the sound is crisp albeit in mono.I give volume one of the "Time Tunnel" five stars for pure television enjoyment.Volume one contains the first 15 episodes of the show,The unaired extended version of the pilot,Irwin Allen's behind the scenes home movies, visual effects,camera test,still galleries and promotional tv and radio spots.Once again it is lacking in cast interviews. many of the actors from this show are still alive,so why didn't the studio interview them for the dvd set?.It would be a welcomed addition to any release to see the actors today and get their thought's on the show.My only gripe is that this show only ran for one season,so why split it into two volumes?.Surely the studio could have compiled all 30 episodes into one boxed set at a reasonable price

English humor is famous for it's eccentricities but with the exception of selected Monty Python you need the English pedigree to really like it. The Young ones pick up where Monty left off. Outrageous, yet real, there is a plot line but it doesn't get in the way. It's a shame there weren't more episodes made....

In the days of the Arcades there was a good movie that came out (and funny enough had a great Arcade game) called Krull. Now mind you, I really had no idea what this movie was all about before i saw it (when i was a whole bunch younger) just saw the 5 bladed "glaive" and was sold but now as an adult i find i still like this movie and it reminds me of a true dungeons and dragons style adventure then almost any other movie (including those terrible scifi D&D movies ugh) it starts off with a prince and of course a princess yes been done before many many times but then in come the Slayers and from then on its a totally different experience. with such ultimate favorites as the Emerald Seer, The Widow of the Web and the Cyclops and of course the shapeshifting (a bit daft too) wizard with some very strange habits (i dare not tell you so as not to ruin it) but this is a classic movie and it will be good for generations to come.
Pros: cool effects (for the time) good story well done plot and themes

cons: may be a bit too old for some and not flashy enough. but remember it is a tad old.
its a 5 star easily some may not agree but judge the movie on its merits and not against those of today and anyone can see the care and detail that made this movie great

The best Cleopatra that the movies has ever produced.Be it in the scenario as well as the performance of an actress in the part.
So many came before and so many after Elizabeth Taylor however to me Cleopatra will always be Elizabeth Taylor.
A mega movie, with fantastic costumes, and acting, is a classic in historic movies.If you are history lover you should have this movie in your collection

PRO + Great story, teriffic acting, beautiful setting
CON - Some pacing flaws, but not enough to destroy the whole

Lindsay Duncan is perfectly cast as the guardian of this endangered photographic archive and Liam Cunningham is her well-cast, perfunctory foil. As as the story unfolds, the differences between British and American style (and culture) are revealed, providing a nice subtext to the plot. 

One of the viewing pleasures is in discovering that not everything is as it appears, from the central story to the character's lives. Good actors all. But my "best actor" award goes to the photographs themselves: the stories they tell and the feelings they evoke are haunting and captivating all at once.  A visually rich film

Loved them all ... found Victoria &amp; Albert and Lorna Doone a bit lacking.  Wondered about having more of The Scarlet Pimpernel offered - he's so smooth!  Tom Jones is very special - loved Sophie's father, he truly made the film.  As much as I liked him - hated Lizzie's mother in P &amp; P - what a ninny!  This is a great collection, would have liked to see Vanity Fair and Persuasion offered also

My 2 year old loves his video. The animations are unusual but they are full of flare, color and imagination. The songs they include are by far the best part and my daughter can't get enough of them. The main character Moustache, and the rest of the characters, are all well imagined and fun. As far as the learning experience my daughter loves to repeat the phrases and sing the songs and I see her using what she has learned all the time, and the semi-interactive format they use really gets her involved in the story line. I personally love this video and would recommend it

This disk collects the two Tales From the Crypt movies on one side of a single disk.  For some reason the menu has the second movie listed first.

In the first movie, Billy Zane is excellent as a demon looking for a final key so that the demons can retake the universe.  This is the story of his battle with the current Demon Knight, the protector of the key.  Wonderfully crafted and dark.

The second movie, Bordello of Blood, is a more tongue-in-cheek T&A-fest and lacks the dark seriousness of the first.  Lilith, the queen of all vampires, has been awakened.  She can be controlled by a key (the one from the first movie).  She has set up a bordello to lure victims to her hunger.  Dennis Miller is his wise-cracking self as he portrays a down-and-out private investigator looking for a missing person.

It is nice not to have to flip the disk over or insert a new disk but there is no room for real extras (we do get the original trailers).  Seeing the two films together really showcases the extreme difference between the two.  The first is dark, well-written and well-acted.  The second is gratuitous, crass and just not quite as good (although it is fun in its own way).  Now they are together at a reasonable price.

This is a beautifully orchestrated tale about the delightful absurdity in all human endeavor. It is also a story of cross-cultural misunderstanding of the highest order.  Kinsky was a madman in the film and in real life and therefore perfect for the part.  The scene of the steam ship spinning out of control in that waterfall is one of the memorable in the history of the cinema. The cinematography and editing are a masterpiece. Unforgettable

A Completely Delightful and Tender Little Film About Disenfranchised Kids

'Fais-moi des vacances' (WE NEED A VACATION) is a finely wrought little film that studies the disparities between the classes in France while introducing us to a warmly tender and humorous friendship between two young lads.  Directed and written by Didier Bivel (with writing assistance from Djamila Djabri) it offers a slice of life we rarely see - that underbelly of France's projects where mixed races strive to exist without the amenities of those with means who surround their neighborhoods.

Lucien (Aymen Saïdi) lives with his father (Bernard Blancan), mother (Hiam Abbass), young sister Pamela (Laura Mas Navarro), and his tough streetwise older brother José (Nabil El Bouhairi) in a small flat.  Close by is his African friend Adama (Ibrahim Koma) and his equally poor family of father (Makan Fofana), mother (Marie-Philomène Nga) and sister Fanta (Hawa Yakaré Sissoko).  As school ends the kids whose families have money take them on a vacation, a state neither Lucien nor Adama can afford despite their obsession with that luxury.  The two boys manipulate funds and ideas and ultimately come up with the idea of secretly jumping aboard a RUV of a family headed for the beach.  BUT despite the success of their plan and the encouragement of the daughter of the van's owners, the boys end up not at the beach but at a nudist camp, a fact that makes them flee!  Upon returning home both boys' families punish their activities and when Lucien seeks comfort from his older brother, José beats him and tells him to grow up.  In the end the boys finagle their way to the beach, but of course by this time vacation time is over and they are on an empty beach re-evaluating their lives.

The cast is uniformly strong, the writing is excellent, and the camera work not only captures the claustrophobia of the projects but also opens up the vistas of the boys' imaginations.  It is a fine little film, one deserving of a wide audience.  Grady Harp, January 07

This one is an old favorite of mine, which I pre-ordered on DVD the instant I learned it was available.  I have an old VHS recording of the film, which I have viewed many times.  I have also read the book many times, and I consider it to be Conroy's best work.

This is the story of four young men at Carolina Military Institute, a fictional military academy located in South Carolina, which is of course a pseudonym for The Citadel, which is a fine military academy that really does exist.  The film is set in the 1960s.  The first black cadet (first year cadets are called "knobs" at the Institute) has just arrived.  A secret society within the Institute, known as "The Ten" has pledged that no black will ever graduate from the Institute, regardless of ability.

David Keith turns in his customary excellent performance as the black cadet's designated mentor.  The plot moves at a fast pace, but nevertheless does not feel rushed.  Purists have criticized the fact that the film leaves out many sub-plots contained in the novel.  I feel that the movie made the right choices about what to keep and what to delete, and of course these choices had to be made unless this was to be a 12 hour miniseries.  

I liked the script, the acting, and the ending.  This is a wonderful film.  It is the type of film that most viewers will watch periodically over the years, and I am delighted that it will shortly be available on DVD.

This movie is truly wonderfully done.  I appreciate the lightheartedness of the characters, and the deep resonances of director Zhang Yimou's commentary on academics in modern rural China.  The language is particularly good for students learning Mandarin Chinese, as it shows an excellent example of the differences between spoken Chinese in the countryside and in the cities.  There are English subtitles for beginners as well.  I highly recommend it.

The economy, austerity and directness of the films of Fritz Lang made him one of the most profound, and precise filmmakers... 

Lang, a master of the German expressionist film, shot his first talkie, a crime drama considered a landmark in the story of suspense movies... It was a shocking idea for its time, based on the real-life killer Peter Kurten, headlined as the Vampire of Düsseldorf...

'M' is about a terrorized city, and a plump little man with wide eyes (often chewing candy) who is a pathological child-killer, unable to control his urge for killing... 

The film embodies several Lang themes: the duality between justice and revenge, mob hysteria, the menacing anticipation of watching a helplessly trapped individual trying fruitlessly to escape as greater forces move inexorably in, and, for probably the first time in the cinema, it adds a new dimension to suspense: pity... For the killer is clearly mentally sick... He cannot overcome the overwhelming compulsion of his murderous disease, and yet, we see him hunted down and almost lynched as a criminal, rather than treated as a sick man... 

Early in the film, the killer is heard whistling the Grieg theme from 'In the Hall of the Mountain King'. This theme inexorably becomes imbued with menace... And when we see no more than a girl looking in a shop window, the melody on the sound-track told us chillingly that the murderer is there, just out of sight...

The Murderer is played by Peter Lorre in a virtuoso performance that has barely been matched in all the thrillers he has made since 'Casablanca,' 'The Maltese Falcon,' and 'The Mask of Dimitrios.' When the photographs of his victims, all little girls, are shown to him, he jumps back and twitches with horror...

With powerful visuals, Lang's motion picture is Lorre's first film... His performance as the corpulent, hunted psychopath is a masterpiece of mime and suggestion... Lorre is the archetypal outsider-outside the law and society because of his compulsive crimes, outside the balancing society of the underworld because he is not a professional criminal... He had only twelve lines of dialog...

In the most famous of all about a pathological killer - Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho' - Anthony Perkins lacked not only the threat of the tortured Peter Lorre, but also the dimension of invoking our incredulous sympathy... 

'Psycho' reeked with blood and horror, whereas the suspense of 'M' is subtle... A child's balloon without an owner, a rolling ball, are enough to tell us that another murder had been committed... The audience, trapped in its seats, torn by ambivalent feelings towards the killer, watched him trapped as the net is pulled tight...

I saw this movie on TV years ago and loved it.  I thought the storyline was terrific.  There's plenty of action, family situations, love interest, but, mostly, this movie engages you -- it forces you to care about the characters.  It's a great movie.  Three words: keep tissues handy

With King Creole, Love Me Tender and Stay Away Joe - JAILHOUSE ROCK 1957 is Elvis Presley at his best. He declined the old musical tradition of MGM and insisted on a contemparary look - especially how the choreography should be executed.

In this film we see ELVIS PRESLEY at his very best. He was a stunning actor - much more prefer HIM to James Dean...  It`s a shame he made more or less 33 forgettable films.... only a handful stands out and JAILHOUSE ROCK is the best.  It isn`t a classic - it isn`t even great. But we have ELVIS - the KING - and that`s the best there is:-))

Asks the interviewer, "What place would you give Shoot the Piano Player in relation to your other films?" Answers director François Truffaut, "No place. Simply the second film I made." Considering his first feature film was The Four Hundred Blows and his third was Jules et Jim, Truffaut's matter-of-factness and lack of pretense is worth a smile. 

Shoot the Piano Player is worth smiles, too. It's a clever film, playful at times, even funny. More than anything, however, it defies categorization. The movie is a strange and successful amalgamation of crime and comedy, suspense and inevitability, tragedy and love, and gangsters, girl friends and violence. It's the story of Charlie Koller (Charles Aznavour), a piano player in a Paris dive, who used to be Eduoard Saroyan, a famous pianist, whose wife committed suicide. Truffaut says the movie is a film about a shy man. Charlie is the kind of shy man who cannot bring himself to touch the hand of a woman he wants. He can't go back and open the door to the room where he left his wife sobbing. He thinks about what he should do, but can't do it, and then circumstances take over. Charlie, thanks to his brothers, finds himself in a gangland underworld where double-crossing is going to lead to a shootout in the snow. Some say Shoot the Piano Player is an homage to American gangster films. Perhaps it is, but I challenge anyone to spend much time considering this possibility while watching the movie. The film is original, funny, moving and sad. It's the kind of film that people who love movies write essays about. All I know is that I was moved by Charlie. We leave him where we met him, playing piano in a Paris dive.

Charles Aznavour, a diminutive man with a hangdog look, plays Charlie perfectly. Aznavour is probably better known in the U. S. as a singer, but in France he's seen as both an actor and a singer. He's a minimalist, he says about himself. Charlie thinks too much and does too little. Aznavour lets us see into Charlie's soul with few words. It's a marvelous performance that left me saddened by Charlie, but liking him.

The Criterion DVD transfer is first-rate. Criterion gives us two discs. The first has the movie and a commentary track. The second disc contains interviews by Aznavour and Marie Dubois, who played Charlie's girlfriend, Lena, plus excerpts from documentaries featuring Truffaut, and other extras. The Criterion case contains a 28 page booklet with substantial material on the film and Truffaut

To Be or Not To Be is a comedy set during WWII. Although it makes light of a tense time in history, it manages to maintain an air of respect and mischief to keep the viewer at ease. The story revolves around two actors in Poland, Maria and Joseph Tura. Joseph (Jack Benny) specializes in overplaying Hamlet and Maria (Carole Lombard) specializes in seducing younger men in her dressing room as her husband begins his "To be or not to be" speech. The man she seduces is a soldier who draws her into a dangerous spy situation. Although she is working for the Allies, a Nazi leader attempts to make her a spy for his cause. Madcap comedy ensues as the actors attempt to get them out of the mess.

The film is very funny thanks to the brilliant dialogue and acting. It is a real shame that Carole Lombard died after this film was made in a plane crash; she proves to be a very beautiful and talented comedienne.

The magnificent frame employment, accent even more the claustrophobic atmosphere about a man in an unnamed country, arrested for an unexplained crime he is never told about. The unbearable tension joins with bureaucratic struggle to involve us in a nightmare of uncalculated magnitude. 
Anthony Perkins' emotive memory after Psycho fit with adjusted accuracy. A magnificent cast headed by Jeanne Moreau, Akim Tamirof, Elsa Martinelli and Welles too. 
A fundamental icon of the cinematography. 
Footnote: It should be known that a special request of Welles around a documental that included at least some shots of the Atomic Bomb were totally denied to him. Something similar happened with Kubrick when he asked for flight sequences of the B-52 IN Dr. Strangelove.

This is a great movie, especially if you like &quot;Dancehall Queen&quot;. Paul Campbell does a great job as Capone and Carl Bradshaw is excellent as usual as the crime boss. While the story is somewhat generic it is still well worth watching

The documentary showed some highlights of some excellent flying by various pilots.  However it did not show the abilities of different jets and pilots from different NATO countries.  The actual excercise is much longer and the documentary could have covered more

The presentation both the picture and sound are top notch.  We found out that not every DVD system can read the IMAX presentation

The movie starts out with our hero, Izo, being gruesomly crucified. Because of his rage towards the ones who crucified him, he travels through time to present day to wreak his vengence on them. Then a bunch of stuff happens that has no relevance to the plot really, including: having sex with mother nature, a woman pulling a sword out of her vagina then izo throwing a rock at her face, being killed several times, a very trippy scene where he is sucked underwater and comes up on the other side of some wedding where he kills the groom and bride then is sucked back, killing little children, killing a group of mothers in the hallway, vampires, being attacked by a swat team, and a random guy singing while playing an out of tune guitar. While he does all this he turns into a demon then finally kills the ones that were responsible for his crucifixion.

This movie gets 5 stars because it is so random and has made me mentally insane since watching it and other japanese films like it

In this movie we once again see Mad Max (sans hot car) wandering around in a Post Apocalyptic world until he discovers Bartertown in the Wasteland.Mel Gibson tries valiantly  to channel  such on screen loners as Clint Eastwood  and John Wayne but only succeeds in making his character look inarticulate with poor social  skills. However he becomes a threat to the Matriarch of the town by the name of Aunty EmTeeVee (or something like that). Then Mel kicks a lot of butt in the process. This is a dismal tedious movie which is only redeemed by the fact that it was filmed in the Outback Opal Mining Town of Coober Pedy which I visited a few years ago

I'm the first to confess that I had never heard any of any of the actors starring in the 1951 Robert Wise gothic noir, The House on Telegraph Hill, but it doesn't matter, because all the actors are good, and combined with an extremely effective plot, the movie is a terrific tale of murder, deceit and assumed identities in post world war San Francisco. 

As was the fashion with many noir films of the time, The House on Telegraph Hill is told in flashback with a voice over from the heroine. She tells of her house that is empty and is up for sale, and one immediately assumes that something terrible has happened. However, the narrative soon jumps to Germany at the end of the War, and we meet Victoria Kopwelska (Valentina Cortese) is a Polish woman imprisoned in Belsen.

With her husband and family dead, Victoria tells the kindly American commander Major Marc Bennett (William Lundigan) that there's nothing for her back in Poland. Desperate to survive, Victoria learns that her best friend has family in the United States, and if they are ever freed, she promises to take Victoria to America with her. Her friend however, is killed shortly before American troops can liberate the camp. 

With nowhere to go, Victoria hatches a scheme to steal her friend's papers and sail to America, where she learns now the godmother to a young boy Chris (Gordon Gebert), as well as the heir to a sizable fortune, and a gorgeously gothic house high atop Telegraph Hill, following the death of her "aunt." Ensconced in the ostensible mansion, Victoria, now dressing in glamorous frocks and drinking expensive champagne marries the boy's guardian Alan Spender (Richard Basehart), partly out of desperation and partly out of the need for security.

As Victoria becomes a "mother" to the boy, she clashes with his governess Margaret (Fay Baker) and coincidently reconnects with Marc whom she met a Belsen, now a studly a playboy type lawyer.  All the adults are not as they seem: Marc has been making secret plans to get his hands on the money, and Victoria's arrival causes him to draft a new scheme.  Victoria begins to believe that her new sweetheart is up to no good. And then there's the Margaret, the furtive outsider and whether her allegiances to Chris are all they seem. 

The film is compelling, and tension-fuelled and beautifully shot in black and white. Cortese is especially good in one of her first American roles and as Victoria, she frantically tries to keep up her masquerade, yet through no fault of her own, she steadily becomes a victim of Alan's scheming. 

Of particular note are the stunning location shots of San Francisco. The main house is just beautiful and the scenes when Victoria is playing baseball with Chris offer stunning views of San Francisco Bay. The House on Telegraph Hill ultimately serves as one of the better noir thrillers - there's a runaway car, poisoned orange juice, an enigmatic and jealous housekeeper and a false identity. It all makes for a gripping and entertaining film. 

Victoria starts out as a victim, and although she schemes and lies her way into the house on Telegraph Hill, her ability to rise above the nefarious misdeeds enable her to achieve a kind of redemption for both her and Chris.  Mike Leonard April 06.

200 American is actually quite pleasantly romantic gay comedy. Even though it looks like a no-budget episode of Queer As Folk or intended to be a gay version of Pretty Woman, it's got a pretty good story. It doesn't rely on fancy production and lighting or cinematography. Most of the actors are straight playing gay roles. I was surprised to learn from the special features material that the entire cast and crew volunteer for this show, something that I can certainly relate to. The acting is acceptable but not great, because most of the actors are not that experienced. I was surprised that there was no production and wardrobe designer! The movie has some kind of charm about it, perhaps it's because it's so sincere and gimmick free, and even the love scenes are very low-key. I was very touched by the romantic plotline between the hustler and his new boss. There is something about a straight guy doing love scene with another male actor, it's very captivating. Sean Matic did a good job with his light Austrilian accent by the way. It's worth rental fee for sure.

This is an adorable movie. It's low-budget and the acting is not
spectacular, but nevertheless, it's a cute story with sexy characters and an impressive, unique plot.

Conrad is a successful, attractive man recently heart-broken. Venturing into the unknown, he hires a sex worker for the night. As it turns out, his hired man, Ian, is quite the catch -- a young, charming, sexy Australian trying to save money to stay in the country. Soon enough, Ian is in Conrad's life every day, though not as you may think.

As Ian moves into Conrad's social life, everyone's issues come to the surface. Love stories unfold and redevelop, problems at home collide with life at work, the truth behind Ian's need to do sex work comes out, and everyone is in for a wake-up call about life and what they need.

Basically, it's genuine, it's cute and charming, and it deals with real-life problems, most of which just happen to be gay, a definite plus in my book. So give its budget a break and sit back and enjoy a film well-worth seeing.

I first saw this movie around 1980, when the Cold War was still on. I had been inundated with propaganda from birth, that all Russians talked about was political, that they didn't do "normal" things or live a normal life. All politics you know. Well, here was this movie about the lives and loves of three women. It was very well acted, and basically, just a long soap! I loved it--and not one word about Lenin, Marx, or anti-Americanisms. I recently saw it again, and liked it just as much. For those who say it is unrealistic--well, how do you know? Do you think that all Russians lived the exact same life? Or because American Cold War propaganda stated that all Russians were totally miserable

John Sturges acquires a reputation as a solid director of superior Westerns filled with tense action scenes such as: "Escape From Fort Bravo," "Bad Day at Black Rock," "Backlash," "Gunfight At The O.K. Corral," "The Law and Jack Wade," "The Last Train From Gun Hill," "Sergeant Three," "The Hallelujah Trail," and one of the best of all Wyatt Earp movies, "Hour of the Gun." 

He succeeds in one of the most exhilarating opening sequences of all Western movies, when he had McQueen and Brynner riding a hearse up legendary Boot Hill creating a mood and peril that never allow the slightest degree of viewer confusion or ennui... For Sturges, the West is a man's world, and his cool, hard, detached style, emphasizing action, excitement and the rugged environment of the frontier, endorses the point...

"The Magnificent Seven" is derived from Kurosawa's superb "The Seven Samurai," a compelling tale of intimidated and impoverished medieval villagers hiring mercenary warriors to repel bandit ravages... The villagers in this case are Mexicans, plagued beyond all bearing by the activities of bandit Calavera, who always leaves them on tortillas and few beans... Three of them cross the border to offer meager pay and sustenance for any professionally skilled fighting men who will aid them...

Yul Brynner is the man, dressed in black, with the luminous dome and the hypnotic Mongolian eyes who portrays the distinctive Chris Adams leader of the seven hired gunmen hired to chase some 'flies from a little Mexican village.' 

Eli Wallach is memorable as Calvera, chief of the ruthless outlaws... He is greedy and merciless terrorizing without pity the poor peasants...

Steve McQueen gives a standout performance as the sardonic gunman ('We deal in lead, friend'), carrying appealing ease and sense of humor to his role as Vin, Brynner's first recruit and second-in-command...

Charles Bronson portrays Bernardo O'Reilly, who explains his curious name to Chris, with 'Mexican on one side, Irish on the other--and me in the middle!' Bronson, the strongest face in Western, and with a bit of Mexican in him--cunning face, steady eyes, revealing voice--the character of Bernardo O'Reilly suits him perfectly... This half-breed gunfighter becomes the conscience of the team... Because of his tender paternal instincts, he is adopted by three children who promise him, in case he falls, to bring him, every day, fresh flowers...

Robert Vaughn--who was to do nicely on TV in "The Man from Uncle" spy spoof-- plays Lee, the 'good gun' with black gloves and nightmares, living in style with no enemies alive...

Brad Dexter plays Harry Luck, Brynner's happy friend who returns to join the team convinced of the existence of a large amount of hidden gold...

James Coburn makes a big impression as Britt, the expert gunman who can out-draw a gun with his knife-throwing... His looks and vague figure of violence are quite a response for his few talks...

Horst Bucholz represents youth, eagerness, and the urge to be proved and sorted out from the boys... He was caught on the road by Rosenda Monteros...

Robert J. Wilke is Britt's insisting challenger who swells the ranks of the villains in many Westerns like "High Noon," "The Far Country," and "Man of the West." 

The Magnificent Seven's success spawned three sequels: "Return of the Seven" (again starring Yul Brynner), "Guns of the Magnificent Seven" and, last and least of all, "The Magnificent Seven Ride." 

With a terrific Oscar-Nominated Musical Score by Elmer Bernstein, "The Magnificent Seven" remains a richly enjoyable Western, shot on location in Morelos state, Mexico...

I was more than impressed by this stupendous documentary.  Not only is it superior, photogrqphically speaking -- not only does it have beautiful & inspiring music -- it is factual and should open our eyes to what we have to lose in the name of oil!  We need to understand why environmentalists and educated elected officials care about protecting this pristine area. I was born, raised and educated in one of the most beautiful places in the U.S. in Boulder, CO -- at the foot of the flatirons -- BUT I truly feel this Alaska wilderness is "God's Country."  Buy this DVD -- view it -- invite everyone you care about to view it with you.  You wll begin to care and maYbe -- just maybe -- you will help to preserve it for your children & generations after you are gone

Born in Steventon, Hampshire in 1775, Jane Austen was one of two daughters of the Reverent George Austen and his wife Cassandra. She was educated in Oxford and in Southampton, finally attending a boarding school in the Abbey gatehouse in Reading, Berkshire. The environment provided by her home was conducive to writing and she often enacted plays for her family, something that gave her the opportunity to present her stories and develop the characters in depth. 

Jane Austen's works are imaginative, full of emotion and depicting relationships that transcend time. Jane Austen wrote about society, about propriety and about etiquette. She was highly critical of the snobbery with which the upper classes kept away from others. Her study of human flaws and prsonal relationships provide great material for the development of her characters.

Jane Austen wrote Pride and Prejudice in 1813 and it still enchants audiences all over the world. The first time I read this book, I read as a child, back in Cuba, "Orgullo y Prejuicio." 

The writings of Jane Austen shaped my perception of true love as I identified with the love between Elizabeth Bennet and her one and only, Mr. Darcy. With this BBC adaptation completed in 1996, I have been able to relive the experience of exposing myself to a classic, one of the best books ever written. With this BBC miniseries we feel as though we were reading the book, for the adaptation faithfully follows the author's writing. 

The filming is magnificent, offering us a view of gorgeous scenery, magnificent castles, and locations that bring the book to life, for we can see what we expected after reading the book. The love story presents the struggle of the times, as two individuals fall in love, regardless of class differences, or status, and yet, the antagonism and friction created as a result of said differences. Darcy is a wealthy single man who, upon meeting the family of Elizabeth, boisterous, non-polished, and simple, believes her to be beneath him. The meet at a dance where his best friend falls in love with Elizabeth sister, but Darcy thinks he knows Jane's heart not to be true to these emotions. Elizabeth overhears a conversation during the dance and feels insulted by the proud and distant Darcy, keeping her distance and yet, without her awareness, falling in love with him. Jane Austen is masterful at creating enough tension to keep us all in suspense as to the path these lives will take as some members of Elizabeth family make the wrong choices. 

The dialogue is almost verbatim to the book, making this series a true delight for those of us who identify with this work. Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth and Colin Firth as Darcy provide magnificent interpretations of this timeless classic, keeping us all dreaming of ever encountering love of this magnitude in our lives. As with most DVDs that we own, we watch by selecting English subtitles, which enhances the viewing by allowing us NOT to miss a single word said by the characters. Who would want to miss a single word in this marvel of the English language? There is a documentary as an additional bonus, where interviews with cast members are included... simply awesome! Interviewed are:  Jennifer Ehle [Elizabeth], Colin Firth [Darcy]. We also get to see those who played Mary Bennet [Lucy Briers], Mr. Collins [David Bamber, Mr. Bingley [Crispin Bonham-Carter] and Mr. Wickham [Adrian Lukis]

This film seems to be known worldwide as a "chick flick", from the romantic aspects of it, to the current anniversary DVD's pink cover.

I'm an 18 year old guy who absolutely digs this film, especially due to the Holly Golightly character. After viewing this film for the first time, I developed a crush on the character Holly (kind of goofy, I guess, but it's very hard for me to dislike a character like her.) Audrey Hepburn played her to perfection. The film was also brilliantly shot by Franz Planer and directed by Blake Edwards. I love the film's dialogue as well, it has a very realistic quality, and it's so fun to hear the characters converse with each other.

"Breakfast At Tiffany's" is perhaps the best "date" movie ever conceived.  This film is an absolute classic that is worth subsequent viewings and it will never age.

For Ina Claire NINOTCHKA was a last chance to show posterity what she could do, for there wouldn't be many film opportunities offered her.  She'd been a leading lady of the stage for nigh on thirty years, and her elegant beauty, very much a high-bred Dina Merrill type look, was still aglow. She was one of Carl Van Vechten's favorite subjects and he took photo after photo of her, staring imperiously against a wall of baize, or reclining on a lace pillow as fleecy as her beautiful blonde hair.

She suffered the ultimate indignity the following year at MGM, when her part in I TAKE THIS WOMAN was taken away from her and given to the cheaper Verree Teasdale.  Her director, Josef Von Sternberg was also let go, and in fact the whole picture was redone so many times studio wags called it I RE-TAKE THIS WOMAN!  The "woman" in question was Hedy Lamarr; after Ina Claire's hilarious showdowns with Garbo in NINOTCHKA, the studio might have thought her perfect for the part of Lamarr's Central European rival.  A year or so later, and Edmund Goulding put her to work as Dorothy McGuire's mother in the charming, underrated CLAUDIA, but that is definitely a mother part and as such, put an end to Ina Claire's film career.

As the countess "Swana" she gets lots of Billy Wilder's best lines and laughs.  She's not afraid of anyone, much less Garbo.  Much has been written about the chemistry between Garbo and Melvyn Douglas, indeed a delightful mix, but the picture would have lacked a lot of its edge without Swana's steely, icy hauteur and her adroit manipulations.

In real life Ina Claire lived on to a great old age.  She was 92 when the last curtain fell for her, and here in San Francisco, where she spent most of her life, all the lights in her building went off for an hour, precisely at 8:30, while her fans stood on the street, devoted and vigilant in our own way as the fans surrounding the Dakota Hotel when John Lennon died

It takes an HBCU graduate to write about the HBCU experience, period. Just look at "A Different World" and how bad the first season was. Debbie Allen (a Howard grad, I believe) stepped in and gave the show the authenticity it sorely needed. So it's no surprise that Spike Lee, the Morehouse man, would make a movie that sparked so much emotion on both sides of the coin. I'm not saying that you had to attend an HBCU to UNDERSTAND "School Daze", but you had to have attended one to get the real "flavor" of what it was like. And you have to have an open mind.

Any HBCU alum saying that this film wasn't realistic is flat-out lying. Yes, it hit on some things that the old folks call "dirty laundry" (such as hazing, color issues, those who think that getting an education makes you "white", and so on), but those things are real at HBCUs - yes, even today. (Major props to Spike for having that ONE dark-skinned sista in the Gamma Rays. Isn't that ALWAYS the way?) And there are no "good" people or bad people; Spike leaves that decision up to you. Julian had his good points (his intelligence, leadership and pride in his town, school, etc) and Dap had his bad points (his blatant bigotry and bullying), and both of them had legitimate points. 

One thing Spike nailed right on was the confrontations that the students tended to have on a regular basis. No offense to whites or anyone who graduated from a PWC, but in my experience at a predominately white high school, I noticed that students there were a lot more subtle with their dislike; they particpated in a more "destroying from within" kind of system, and grew wide-eyed and offended when confronted, even with solid proof. ("I would NEVER spread rumors about you/sleep with your boyfriend/steal your term paper!") Black students, on the other hand, will take ANYONE head-on, whether that person is the school president, captain of the football team, the richest kid on campus, crippled...doesn't matter. Your "status" doesn't count if you go to an HBCU. I had a friend who saw SD and said "That is SO unrealistic! Since when do college kids go fighting with each other all the time?" She graduated from the University of Texas. Enough said.

I'm so grateful for this film, and its realistic portrayal of black HBCU students for those who think that all young black people do is have babies and suck up welfare, and that people only go to HBCUs because they can't get into a "real" college. I wouldn't trade my experience at Florida A&M University for a degree at any PWC. RATTLERS

Although Tomorrow is Yesterday is an okay episode, it is not one to rave about.It is certainly not one of the original series' best. However, Return of the Archons is one of the best and one of my favourites.Kirk, Spock and McCoy investigate a planet where the inhabitants appear to be in a drug-induced state then rapidly change from walking peacefully and amiably along the streets into violent and looting maniacs that seem to lose all inhibitions. A mob attacks Kirk and crew and they are forced to defend themselves with their phasers. It seems the planet is run by a man named Landru, who advocates peace and tranquility to the extent that you get "absorbed".A kind of brainwash conditioning into thinking only of harmony and serenity.Later it is discovered that Landru is a computor projection;the edict of Landru who died 5,000 years ago has been continued by a computer I just read a review saying the solution to the Landru mystery won't surprise anyone, it sure surprised me. I didn't see that one coming

This DVD contains three episodes of "Bear in the Big Blue House." The first two have a birthday party theme. The final one doesn't really anything to do with a party, but it is still rocking.

The fun starts with "Mouse Party" when our friends in the Big Blue House put together a surprise party for Tutter the mouse. The viewer is asked to keep the secret as they prepare the party - putting together the decorations, making the cake and keeping Tutter in the dark. Tutter considers the fact that he's getting older and finally, viewers rock to "Happy, Happy Birthday" when the time comes for Tutter's big party.

Next comes "Bear's Birthday Bash." This is an episode that recalls "Mouse Party" in many ways, except this time it's Bear who's having the birthday. He'd like to have a nice, relaxing day, but the kids of the Big Blue House decide to throw him a surprise party.

Finally, "Dancin' the Day Away" finds everyone in the Big Blue House having some fun with dance. Tutter, however, doesn't think that he can dance, but Pip and Pop show him that he really can.


This is a fun show with awesome singing and adorable characters and stories. My favorites are Tutter and Ojo (and the big old Bear himself), but they're all wonderful. This DVD includes bonus sing-alongs of the various songs

Victor Hugo's enormous output is unique in French literature... He was described as 'The most powerful mind of the romantic movement' and his novel, published in 1862, continued to be widely read...

The plot - that of a detective - is as well the epic of the people of Paris... Its author claimed it as a 'religious' work, and indeed by means of its characters, sometimes a little larger than life, yet always vital and engaging, and by its re-creation of the swarming Parisian underworld, the main theme of man's ceaseless combat with evil clearly emerges while the whole gives a faithful picture of the declines and flow of life...

Hugo relives his youth in this vast novel, the culmination of 14 years work... He and Valjean share their most outstanding characteristic: their charitable heart...

The story contains glimpses of Hugo's disgust towards 'the treatment of the lower class French citizens by the government: Valjean, an ex-convict recently released from prison, but he is not given the opportunity to make a good living for himself; Fantine forced into prostitution due to the lack of money to pay her illegitimate child...

And towards the 'general injustice of the law enforcement system: Valjean sentenced to prison for stealing a loaf of bread; Fantine arrested for hitting a man of a higher class...

The symbol of France's greed that Hugo despises is Thenardier - the man that Fantine entrusts Cosette to - who betrays the trust by essentially making Cosette his personal slave...

The strongest emotions of "Les Misérables are love and hate...

Javert and Valjean are both extremes, with a conscience incredibly strict...

Liam Neeson is cast as the gentle Valjean who takes the twist of fate parlaying it into personal success and moral rehabilitation... He changes his ways to become years later the much-loved mayor of Vigau, and as a caring businessman he struggles to forget the past and manages to redeem his soul becoming benevolent, giving manual and financial help to the weak, sick and poor...

After nine years, Valjean was horrified to discover that Javert - a former guard of the Quarries of Toulon, where he served almost 20 years - has arrived to be the head of Vigau's police force...

Valjean's desire to protect the employees from bad influences leads him to fire (indirectly) one of his workers Fantine - turned prostitute... He assumes responsibility for raising her daughter Cosette... He becomes a father figure and soon forces the choice of sacrificing his own freedom for her happiness...

Geoffrey Rush plays the icy chief inspector Javert, the man who tries "to live his life without breaking a single rule." When he is given the job of spying in the barricades and Valjean gives him his freedom instead of shooting him, things begin to fall apart for him...

The action of mercy of Jean Valjean causes him to doubt the solid base of his existence... He is in emotional agony unable to betray his convictions... He sees too late the truth...

Valjean's legendary physical strength are enough to stir his suspicion that the town mayor is a fraud... He is less villain than a man driven by his own hard concept of justice begging permission of his superiors in Paris to investigate the mayor, the man he believes is a convict...

When he thinks he has made a mistake in identifying Monsieur Le Maire as the 'convict' Jean Valjean, he insists on informing him that he has denounced him unjustly and that therefore he must be dismissed: "You must punish me", he says, "or my life will have been meaningless." (A key line in the film).

Uma Thurman approaches the self-indulgent character of Fantine with admirable restraint, giving a certain level of charm and charisma to the film... She gives her sick mother role a good amount of realism demonstrating her character's frustration and pain exquisitely...

Fantine's misery overwhelms her as she sells her body to support her child... Being in a wild state, enraged at how she is a helpless victim of misery, she is arrested after being humiliated by several would-be customers, but Valjean intercedes on her behalf overriding Javert's authority...

When Valjean helps her, she begins to rediscover hope... Her joy at the thought of having Cosette with her is great... But the shock of Valjean's arrest and the discover that Cosette is not there, are too much for the poor creature...

Claire Danes plays the teenage Cosette who realizes one day that she has become quite beautiful... She disobeys her father's rules by secretly sneaking out and seeing Marius - a charismatic young Parisian revolutionary - with whom she fell in love...

Cosette spends her childhood as a servant girl at the Thenardier's inn, horribly mistreated and constantly terrified... She grew up in a convent, innocent, pure and a bit naïve...

Peter Vaughan is excellent as the compassionate bishop whose act of generosity turns an embittered Valjean around...

Bille August tries to capture the essence of Hugo's morality staging its political turmoil strongly enough to give it contemporary resonance, keeping the eternal three elements: the bishop handing over the candlesticks; Fantine's collapse; Marius crying out: "To the barricades!"

History doesn't change, as Voltaire once remarked... But what we need from it, does... Valjean's story is not unique, it's universal... In other world, it's contemporary... There are certainly enough "Les Misérables" to go all around the world...

This set is fine as far as it goes.  However, where are THE STRAWBERRY BLONDE and THE OKLAHOMA KID?  

Warners has given other actors 6 or 7 disc sets.  Why not Cagney?

On the other hand, maybe a CAGNEY, VOLUME 2 is in the works.

Let's hope so

Funny thing to mention here is that the stated region block (region 1) isn't really present. I took the shot to order this and unlock my DVD player if I had to (I live in Amsterdam, region 2) but I didn't have to!! This DVD is region free! Thanks Amazon, but in future it would be nice to provide correct region-information. I bet that a lot European (and perhaps Australian, Russian and so on) customers cancel their order because of the region code not corresponding with their country region.

Charles Laughton is typically wonderful in his broadly-played role as England's King, Henry the Eigth, who infamously married six different queens, divorcing or executing them as circumstances warranted.  The script to this magnificent Alexander Korda production is a witty jab at English history buffs, touching only briefly on the supposed treachery of Ann Boleyn,  concentrating instead on the preposterous emotional life of the lusty, capacious King. Laughton, as ever, is a marvel, skillfully presenting Henry at first as a thinly-cariacatured lout, and gracefully embuing him with gradual shades of pathos and humanity.  Viewers who look to this film as historical drama are clearly missing the point: this is all about the cleverly-rendered script, which turns British schoolboy lessons on their heads, and on the classy ensemble acting, which admittedly may be hard to focus on with the lamentable quality of the current print (I'm writing in the year 2003; perhaps Criterion or some other class-act movie restoration company can correct this problem soon).  Still, fans of early British cinema will enjoy this film a lot

For me, this movie is very different than other Holocaust movies, in that it explores the issue of what happened to Jewish spouses of Aryan women...the story itself is based on a true occurrence, and the movie begins with a wake...the widow is tormented by visions of her past in wartime Berlin & shows disapproval at her daughter's choice of a non-Jewish fiance...the daughter then discovers there is more to her mother's past than she was ever told, and travels to Germany to discover her mother's past...the story is told in flashbacks through reminiscences, and basically focusses on the plight of Aryan women in Berlin whose Jewish husbands have been confined in a place called Rosenstrasse...I won't give too much away, but I must say that for a slow-paced movie, it is quite gripping as we are kept guessing as to the final fate of the Jewish spouses...as for the acting, the characters from the past did an excellent job, their performances were very realistic, and heart-wrenching, especially the actress who plays the main role of Mrs Fabian Fischer, the Aryan wife. In the present day, the actress who plays the daughter who seeks to unearth her mother's past wasn't very convincing, but all in all the story itself makes up for other lacks in the movie, and it is definitely watchable for the unique plot

Seth Brundle (Goldblum) is a scientist who might just have invented the world's first teleporter. The only bug (pun intended) is the fact that it doesn't handle flesh and live teleportations. Ronnie (Geena Davis) is a writer for Particle magazine and will stay by his side, documenting via video his attempts to break through. Upon successfully teleporting a baboon, Seth gets cocky and decides to try and teleport himself; a fly slips into the pod while he teleports. At first, Seth finds newfound strength and agility, but pretty soon he's changing for the worst. 

This is one of Cronenberg's best films, masterfully directed and executed. It's also Jeff Goldblum's finest performance to date! Not content on doing a mere remake (the original Fly (1958) is a much different film starring Vincent Price), Cronenberg brings this film to the next level--literally. It's filled with deep human drama and let's not forget the award-winning special effects! Top notch effects contribute in putting this film ahead of the pack of other mid-eighties sci-fi/horror flicks. The film overall has aged well (it's already been twenty years) if not for the eighties fashion statements.

I'm having a hard time figuring out which it is more; a sci-fi or a horror film? I guess it's a fusion of both (I gotta stop these bad puns!). Whether you see it for the first time or revisit it, Cronenberg's The Fly is a great gory, character-driven, profoundly human film. The second disc is chock full of special features: various documentaries and a making-of, screenplays, the original short story on which the original film is based, trailers for all the Fly movies ever made, deleted scenes, and much much more. A must have for any Cronenberg fan

As any visual footage on Ike & Tina Turner is pretty scarce, I guess we may be thankful for this great DVD. Their 1971-show being integrally covered by Dutch television, it reveals Ike & Tina supported by a pretty good band and, last but not least, by the marvellous Ikettes. All this at a time their performance must have been at its very peak.

The casting here was excellent - Ben Stiller, Elle Macpherson, Sarah Jessica Parker were all great. In fact, I am convinced that Elle Macpherson can act because of the 3 movies I have now seen her in, she plays decidedly different people in each one. She is perfectly cast as Joe's dream woman. I found Eric Schaeffer's character the least appealing of the whole cast. Some of the jokes here are wildly funny.  The audience is never given a clue that the Jane Lindquist character is only getting involved with Joe to indulge the fantasy world he had created of her. I thought it was odd that she enjoyed his voyeurism and then seemed honestly interested in him sexually, but was not interested in a relationship with him. Earlier her character makes a statement that the world makes too much of the sexually charged days in the beginning of relationships, people move on after that part is over and that a lasting relationship is what she wants. That part did not make sense. This could have been improved by some better writing and better character development. The humor here is what makes this worth watching

Othello is a difficult production for me to watch at any time. Seeing the horrors of jealousy run amuck to the destruction of innocence is painful at the best of times. In the instance of this production it is even more painful because it is so well done.

The story of Othello is that of a Venetian general who marries a local daughter of a nobleman. The general happens to be black. In an effort to sabotage the general, Iago undermines the faith of the husband for his wife leading ultimately to the tragedy of her death. While Shakespeare gives motivations for his characters, interpretations and emphases tend to vary. Kenneth Brannagh's production of Othello emphasies Iago as a troublemake who likes to cause trouble simple for the sake of doing so. This production, with Ian McKellan in the role of Iago, puts more emphasis on his desire for revenge in reaction to a perceived slight. Both are accurate portrayals but the former seems to show more delight in "being bad" wheras the latter seems more inclined to "get even". Both are excellent and accurate but the emphasis in this film makes the heaviness of the theme that much more difficult to endure.

The role of Desdemona is portrayed in this version by Imogen Stubb and she is a delight to watch. She bring an alluring innocence to the role that makes her demise all that much more tragic. So too is the title role played admirably. The problem with Othello is that he is at heart and honorable man but lets his passions rule him and cause him to lash out with devatiging consequence.

This is a fine performance all around with a difficult play. If you can keep your anger at the antics of the characters in check, it is well worth the time

I grew up with the original DS.  I also saw the two "spin off" movies: "House of Dark Shadows" and "Night of Dark Shadows."  Needless to say I was extremely excited about the "revival," and I wasn't disappointed.  I felt that Dan Curtis was actually able to improve upon the original, by tightening up the script and employing wonderful actors who fit like the proverbial glove.  The original Barnabus was played by Jonathan Frid who was a Shakespearian trained actor and, Ben Cross is a member of the Royal Shakespearian Theatre in London.  I loved that the revival was able to be more overtly sexual, which as any fan of vampires must know is an essential element of the myth.  And I must say this series lived up to my every expectation.  Dan Curtis took the original and made it completely accessible to older viewers who have such fond memories of the 1963 soap opera.  I looked forward to 3:30 every day after school.  It's too bad that the Gulf War killed it.  Yes it did!  I was there.  After the Sunday, Monday miniseries, that Friday was to air the first "episode."  However it was pre-empted by coverage of the War.  Too, too bad.  I taped it, but unfortunately the last few episodes were accidentally taped over.  I am so glad to know that I can order it now in it's magical entirety.  I'm ordering it right now!  Thank you Amazon!!!!!!!

If you are a fan of things that go bump in the night, you will LOVE this series!!!!

This Minnesota-filmed movie reportedly has a cult-following, 
and the reason is not far to realize.  Joe Mazzello.  Joe is a 
1990s and 21st century motion-picture phenomenon.  His presence
in this movie is so REALISTIC and life-life that you forget that
he is acting.  He was pivotal in carrying this movie.  How so?
May I add that Joe's axiom for acting is simply:  "Just make it look Real!" He achieved this to a stellar degree in "The Cure," and also in the later fare: "Simon Birch".  Incredible acting, and I know good acting, for I was in a film in the early 1990s and also wrote the musical
score for it.  No, I am not going to name-drop.

The Cure juxtaposes 2 boys of different social/geographical/educational genres together and in this movie a friendship is unexpectedly
forged and may I add that it is a friendship of rare mutual-concern, honest caring, and warm affection. No matter how many times I watch it, tears always come to my eyes in the final 20 minutes of this film.  
Joe is the best!

This Jet Li movie is thus far the best movie since Shaolin Temple as Younger Jet Li. Its awesome surreal fighting creates this Epic feel to the whole Genre of martial arts fighting. Jet Li has never been so swift and so passionate in this movie. It has laughter, suspense, compassion, and innocense. The most spectacular scene is the dual fights with his son doing foot to shoulder cambat against the Witches pawn. This film is highly recommended to those who love Jet Li and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. An Excellent movie to add to the Jet Li collection

VHS - I have watched this over and over and LOVED every minute of it so much so I have now ordered the DVD I only wished the film could have lasted longer. I never worry about what other people think I prefer to make my own mind up and entirely disagree with the negative comments and will not let others spoil my enjoyment of the film whatsoever.  Make up your own mind and don't let others put you off!  I have all Jane Austen's BBC series but this is my FAVOURITE.

I really liked this movie. I thought it was a great super hero movie that had some humor built into it. It was well told and the characters were well developed. The special effects were great too!! I am not one for comic book heros, but this one confinced me otherwise. I recommend this movie to anyone that wants to see a good over evil story that was orginally a comic book character.

This movie classic, is a fabulous movie.  The story represents a common dilemma faced by 1st generation young people whose parents are immigrants.
Here is this sensitive, kind-hearted fellow, Marty, a butcher, who just wants to meet a nice girl and get married. Nobody really wants him to be happy and have his own life, especially his mother, and his aunt.  These two actors play their character parts perfectly, just like real "battle-axes" from the "old country,"  etc.  They gossip and try to ruin his relationship with a nice girl he has just met. It is hilarious and entertaining and very true to life.  I love watching this movie over and over

Alfred Hitchcock's second film after being brought to America by David O. Selznick was SUSPICION, which he made while on loan to RKO Pictures. As in his first Hollywood flick, REBECCA, he put Joan Fontaine to very good use and ultimately these two films made her into a star.

Fontaine won the Best Actress Academy Award for her portrayal of Lina McLaidlaw, a bookish and innocent (but wealthy) young woman who gets swept off her feet by the caddish Johnnie Aysgarth (Cary Grant). After their quick courtship and marriage against her father's wishes, Lina begins to see Johnnie for who he really is--a penniless leech--but she naively continues to love him nonetheless. Johnnie's charm is ostensible, yet his irresponsible ways are increasingly becoming inexcusable. Lina's trust eventually gives way to suspicion when she begins to believe that he might go to any length to pay off his mounting debts.

Hitchcock masterfully builds suspense in this movie and manages to maintain it for the duration of the picture. The movie's only flaw is its tacked-on and seemingly contrived final scene which, we are told, was due either to Mr. Grant's popularity during these years or to the existence of the Production Code in effect in Hollywood at that time. Hitchcock wanted a darker ending but, as we see here, he lost that battle. However, he did not give in as completely as some would have us believe. The ending remains ambiguous enough to allow us to project either a happy or a sinister conclusion according to our own sensibilities.

SUSPICION is classic Hitchcock. Grant and Fontaine turn in masterful performances and Nigel Bruce is irresistible as the dimwitted and loveable "Beaky," Johnnie's old chum. The flawed ending prevents placing SUSPICION at the top of any list of Hitchcock's achievements, but it is a fine film nevertheless and I can only give it my highest recommendation.

I loved this movie...it was a little hard to follow because of the commercial break timings in it.  This did not make the movie any less great it just made the movie a little hard to follow because it kept repeating the intro. at the time that the commercial breaks should have been because of it being a TV show that was made into a movie

I'm not usually a ballet person.  I haven't seen anything since "The Nutcracker" when I was six.  But this was absolutely brilliant.  The concept for it is completely bold and original and Adam Cooper as The Swan blew me away.  How can you beat a dancer in black leather pants with a riding crop?  Tchaikovsky never would have envisioned this, but he would be utterly thrilled to see what they have done with his epic ballet.

This movie has more magic than a wand. This movie is a story about having faith in your beliefs. Young Jessica is so sure that this reindeer is Prancer she is willing to go to extremes to help save her friend. Sam Elliot plays a tough dad who wants to have faith in his only daughter but is scared of losing her and his farm. This a wonderful classic for the young and old.

Scratching deeper beyond the surface one can find RETURN OF THE SEVEN to be significantly different from its predecessor, THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. It is much more than a thematically framed sequel which it can easily be mistaken for. RETURN OF THE SEVEN is a dark film and it does not offer the hope of a truly optimistic future for any of its characters. In this respect it is a complete inversion of THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. Through their catharsis in the original we saw an attempt at redemption through an act of nobility on the part of the seven. They truly were noble and I believe were redeemed for their transgressions as gunmen. Some thought they could start their lives over again but inevitably they could not. That film had to end as it did with the seven ultimately all committed to their singular code of ethics and morality in an emotionally charged finale. In this film there is very little emotion on the surface. Instead director Burt Kennedy gives us a thought provoking study into the human psyche and the very nature of defeatism of the human spirit. In this film there are no pretensions on the part of the seven. For most of them this is just another gun job. There are no higher aspirations that they are cognizant of. If it were not this job, it would be the next. To tell his story Burt Kennedy focuses almost entirely on the character of Chris the leader, perfectly portrayed again by Yul Brynner. This is not really a tale of the seven. Instead Kennedy uses Brynner with all his aplomb and apparent stoicism to curiously examine and probe the motivations of the other six, Lorca the villain (pompously played by Mexican director Emilio Fernandez) and several other key characters. In effect Kennedy takes what was apparently a happy or satisfactory ending from THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN and asks what if. What if 10 years later the remaining characters are not so contented as prior events led us to believe they would be? Would friends be willing go up against innumerable odds? Would strangers once again sign on to go up against those same innumerable odds? Do the strong still have to help the weak? And who really are the strong and the weak? When 50 or more marauding vaqueros whisk away Chico (Julian Mateos) and other Mexican farmers from surrounding villages Chris and Vin (Robert Fuller) agree to come to his aid.  However it is Chris alone that recruits the members of the "seven" this time out. Kennedy singularly endows Chris a sense of morality and level headedness in this film that comes from his wisdom and manner of nobility. In effect this is Brynner's film all the way. Just as John Sturges' directorial style was so smooth that his own storytelling glossed right over the depth and complexity of his own work so is Burt Kennedy's. However, Kennedy is challenged with a very dark and brooding tale to tell. Where Sturges' THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN could easily have been taken on a purely action film level and still been successful, Kennedy does not have that luxury. Kennedy has to deliver an action film built on previous events and he also has to approach the story from a different perspective to remain fresh yet keep it thematically to the concept of the original "Seven." Not an easy task! If the viewer does not look deeply into this film it may just appear as a well produced `dud.' However, I believe Kennedy succeeds far beyond expectations the more times I view this film. Again it comes back to Brynner. He makes members of the seven (Vin, Chico and Colbee) all come to realizations about themselves with his subtle yet profound dialogue.  He gives Riker and Luis a chance at redemption even though both men come from total opposites of the spectrum. He helps the failed priest rise from his failures "at least as far as his knees." Chris even gives Lorca, the villain a chance to ride out because when Chris was younger he gave him the same chance. However, Chris refuses to let Lorca now bathe his personal grief as an ineffectual father "in other men's blood." Yet even Lorca is literally redeemed by the end of the film. When Petra tells Chris that the farmers will never forget them he simply replies, "That's all a man can ask." That is the mystique and legacy of the "seven." Even the character of Chris is endowed with human flaws. He recklessly took on the young Manuel rounding out the seven "for luck" with tragic results and we see Brynner deeply grieved on the screen. This is a film of hard lessons learned. Technically this is a well-made film. The cinematography is full of crane, dolly and tracking shots, which gives it both perspective and movement. Bernstein's score is full and lush and this is the single cohesive element that keeps the seven together. The set designs are dark, grim and rustic giving the film a pensive psychological depth. The payoff for Brynner and the viewer comes in the final shot. Looking at the farmers rebuilding the village he comments, "I'll be damned." Vin looks at him and responds, "I doubt that. I doubt that very much."  They both ride off. They just don't make heroes like that any more

The movie is excellent.  I was hoping to find the directors cut with additional footage, but the regular DVD is excellent as well.  Not many additional features, but the movie is delightful and, although slightly longer then some, holds the viewers interest.  Minor amounts of nudity, some very graphic fist fighting, but not excessive and always appropriate to the plot.  One of Ron Howard's best films

I own both the ultimate Editon and the Extreme DVD. I want to say that you can play the Theatrical version on your T.V with the Two-Disc Extreme Special Edition, on your menu on disc it should say play special Edition, hit right four times and "the future is not set" should be highlighted, push enter and you should see "play theatrical version on your menu. I am a little dissipointed that when I bought the Extreme DVD at Best Buy it did not have a metal case. Either way I love T2, it's a classic that never gets old

When people talk about buddy-buddy films this one gets overlooked.This was a refreshing break from the Eastwood mold,stepping down from the Dirty Harry altar, to switch sides of the law or God(as a preacher).This has a loaded cast, Clint Eastwood, Jeff Bridges(Oscar nominee/robbed)to George Kennedy, as another evil meanie.The oddball teaming of Eastwood and Bridges seals the movie as an enjoyable romp, where cross-dressing,wearing disguises and other stuff plays second-hand to the relationship which is supposed to be mentor/rookie but becomes Laurel/Hardy too often.The story itself wanders off in various directions until it comes home with unexpected sadness, marking the arrival of the versatile Bridges.Like "Collateral," where Cruise lets Jamie Foxx run with the movie, Eastwood generously let Bridges vamp for effect. Such a free-wheelin' script has not hit the screen in a long while.

Daniel Day-Lewis must be the most versatile film actor in the world. He looks like a different person in almost every film he makes. I assume that's the real Day-Lewis in this flick about the rebellion in Northern Ireland, revenge and absolution. His romantic interest, Emily Watson, puts in a good performance too. Day-Lewis looks a lot different than he did in &quot;Gangs of New York&quot;, &quot;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&quot;, &quot;My Left Foot&quot; and &quot;Last of the Mohicans&quot; but he is just as compelling in his performance. I thought this movie degraded a bit at the end with its somewhat Hollywood finale, but otherwise I enjoyed it. If you like substantial filmmaking, good acting, great drama, unfamiliar vistas and a good story, you'll enjoy it too

A pure and engaging story of redemption amongst family, `You Can Count on Me' tells the story of Sammy (Laura Linney) and Terry Prescott (Mark Ruffalo), siblings who lost their parents in a horrific car crash when they were still very young.  Years later and Sammy is a single mother of 8-year-old Rudy (Rory Culkin), she works hard at her job at the bank, now run by over critical Brain Everett (Matthew Broderick), and she struggles with telling her son just how much of a jerk his father really is (Josh Lucas has a great cameo as Rudy Senior).  When Terry shows up after months of no communication Sammy is immediately thrilled, but shortly after his arrival she realizes her brother is still a screw-up and is just using her, again.

Terry shows up in need of money to pay for his girlfriend's abortion, but when his girlfriend tries to commit suicide he decides he needs to take a break from his life and so he stays with Sammy and Rudy.  Over the course of a few weeks Terry has made a deep impact, especially in the life of young Rudy who idolizes him.  This film follows the changes each of these siblings make, changes in themselves but also changes they cause others to make.  It's a beautiful story of redemption and acceptance and it shouldn't be missed.  The performances by the two leads are outstanding, and young Rory Culkin is adorable and mature as Sammy's son, but the real shock to me was Matthew Broderick who played the demanding, philandering, unlikable type brilliantly, and he's not one I'm generally impressed with

He covers in an excellent way how to slap, pop, mute, develop a groove, how to play with drum machines, ghost notes, and does some licks in larry graham, louis johnson, and marcus miller style and it is laid out in a very good manner.  very good instructional video

This is an honestly forgivably slightly too long film that manages to be surprisingly crass with three dimensional characters and capture much of war's bad brutality (but necessity hey the men and women set fire to are all deranged nazis). I love the scenes best where Sutherland plays a general and the part where the english chicks show up at sort of dance with the dozen (interesting if English Jill Ireland had been one of the ladies there--with Charles Bronson looking at her-- which she wasn't---but the mostly hot chicks they have do just fine). Before I saw the film I heard Ernest Borgnine was in the movie and I thought he was going to be one of the dozen. There is no really solidly likable member of the dozen (Sutherland's probably the closest they come to this and he is rather undeveloped) and Borgnine could have fit the bill very nicely had he been a convict--instead they've got him in a more dull role of a general. But what the dozen lack in likability they make up for in interest. Cassavettes (whom I strongly physically resemble by the way) is outstanding as the most crooked but slickest member of the dozen and he shines best. Savalas is next best as the lust hating psycho (hey sex between men and women is needed to produce babies, Telly, or the human race would have ceased to exist a long time ago and the book of Genesis talks of man and woman becoming one). Bronson is the true chameleon of an actor as just 8 years later he'd be the very different vigilante Paul Kersey of Death wish so different than the very tough but still gentler fellow he plays here. Marvin brilliant in the lead as the head major leading the dozen(probably even better than the very good John Wayne would have been). Nice turn by Bob Ryan as a decent colonel who rather understandably makes things hard for the covert dozen. The rest of the cast is mostly very good too. Very good film!

This is one of my all-time favorite vampire movies. The cast led by Tom Cruise as the vampire Lestat, and Brad Pitt as the vampire Louis does an excellent job of bringing to life Anne Rice's Interview with the Vampire. The costumes and sets are evocative of the respective eras the vampires live through, and the cinematography is lush and sensual, evoking the decadent lifestyle that Lestat leads...even Kirsten Dunst has a role here as a child vampire, and her famous line "I want some more" has been rendered immortal in movie history. The chemistry between Lestat [Cruise] & Louis [Pitt] is believable and in fact, they give one of their best dramatic performances in this movie. All in all, a cinematic treat

I would reccomend this film to any Robert Johnson fan as well as to anyone just getting into the blues who wants to know where its really at. It includes some great interviews with Johnny Shines, Robert jr Lockwood and others who knew Robert. Its worth it just to hear Lockwood play an unrecorded song of R.J.'s! The parts where Keb' Mo' re-enacts segments from R.J.'s life are well done and effectively illustrate what life would have been like back then for a traveling bluesman. My only criticism would be that there are few extra DVD features,however, that doesn't stop me watching this film again and again! A very informative insight into the life of one of the greatest Delta bluesmen

This is my second favorite John Woo movie with great touches of action and drama, When I first saw this film (about 5 years ago) I wasn't used to seeing this much violence on screen (And I thought Lethal Weapon was extremely violent at that time) I was in shock and more then once my jaw dropped. This film is VERY violent But compared to other action films this is REALLY tame nowadays. The minor points of this film would be some bad acting to some worse acting in some spots, some weird cuts and editing, the subs were terrible, as the same with the audio quality and some of the camera work is bad, but this is John Woo's first (if you can count heroes shed no tears) landmark heroic bloodshed film so we all know he could have done worse MUCH worse. Yun fat chow, Ti Lung and Leslie Chung have their good moments to bad moments, most of the good moments goes to Chow and Ti while Leslie had only one or two moments. The plot is like this A cop must confront his criminal brother. That's it. If your the typical Hollywood action goer this is your perfect find. But as I said if your new to the heroic bloodshed films don't make this your first one, I'll say stick with the killer and hard boiled for a few weeks then move on. But if your the Hollywood action movie goer make this your first if you can handle it move on to the other heroic bloodshed films and so on. This film is a big landmark in the action genre and a even bigger landmark to the underground action genre. I really recommend this film to any action fan!!!!

This was a very interesting movie.  A friend told me to watch this movie after I told him that I really liked the movie The Skeleton Key.  I think I liked The Skeleton Key better... but this was still a really good movie.  There are a few scenes with nudity in it.  Not a movie for the youngsters. We had to stop the movie a couple times to talk about it and at the end my husband was the only one who guessed how it was going to end.  A good movie if you want a movie that keeps you guessing

With season 4 the series starts to slide a little. I don't think the show is weaker,it's just that how long can you watch a story before it starts to seem like you been there done that already? Look, I love the Godfather one and two,but three is just not as good. The total time it takes to watch the first two Godfather films is a little over 5 hours! That won't even get you through season one of the Sopranos. I hope I speak for everyone out there when I say that as good as the Sopranos is, it will never come closed to the Godfather movies. So I guess it is just starting to get old. I will certainly be watching the finale episodes, I just hope it isn't too big a let down. For those who are interested the DVD set has great transfers, but few interesting extras

For sheer excitement, you cannot beat this DVD.  The music is exciting, arranged well for brass ensemble, and recorded with high quality.  But that's only the beginning...

In Blast, the band vigorously acts out all the pieces they perform.  How they manage this energy level will flat-out amaze you.  I can honestly say that, after just seeing these performances, you are as happily exhausted as the performers must be.

Prepare to be thrilled..

What a great idea, to make a documentary of violinist Hilary Hahn traveling around the world and concertizing.  Undoubtedly at the top of her profession, Hahn never fails to amaze with her unmistakably gorgeous tone, enviable precision, and brilliant musicality.  This DVD "portrait" includes personal footage of Hahn backstage at the Philharmonie in Berlin, as well as a tour at the Curtis Institute, a recording session at Abbey Road Studios, and a trip to Hong Kong.  In an age of music commercialism, Hahn is refreshingly real and self-deprecating.  Included on this DVD are excerpts from the Korngold Concerto, Mozart Sonata for Piano and Violin in G major, The Lark Ascending by Vaughan Williams, Chaconne from Partita in D minor by Bach, and the Paganini Concerto No. 1.  On the menu there is additional concerto footage, which includes the Korngold Concerto and Mozart sonata in their entirety - thank goodness, because there's nothing more aggravating than replaying excerpts.  If for nothing else, buy the DVD for these complete live recordings, because they are absolutely sublime.  The outer movements of the Korngold sound a lot like film music, which the classical music lover may or may not like, but the second movement is incredibly beautiful and highly recommended.  The Mozart sonata is also very well played, but this is nothing new as Hahn has already released a recording of this.  This DVD is important because it contains video footage of Hahn performing - the only other DVD where you can find her playing is The Last Night of the Proms, in which she plays the Mozart Concerto No. 4 in D Major and Presto from Sonata No. 1 by Bach, but the sound quality is somewhat lacking and certainly doesn't do justice to Hahn

Don't discount this film because you are dismayed by Tom Cruise. This film is excellent and a must see. The symbolism in this film alone makes it worth a look. Attempt to ignore good old Tom and rekindle your love for him pre-insanity. Kubrick rarely gets enough accolades for this movie, as he should

The essence of painter Francis Bacon is not a personal life lived on the sordid side but how he was forced to take in life.  Seen through his central nervous system and eyes, we experience  his world of fragments, like collage pieces of existence.  The only place he could make those fragments whole was in a painting. Otherwise, he was wholly inable to put a fully realized human being, himself, together.  Tellingly, one of his best friends comments that he has done a superb one-on-one job with his lover George in his paintings of George.  However, he has been unable to do that in his actual life lived with George!  That sums up Bacon, his art and his life, in a nutshell.  Bacon is not a person you will like but you will understand him and how the fragments of his existence made for great art.  Yet he is also the most alone person imaginable, something no amount of lovers and sordid excess could allay.  One of the very best films about an artist ever made.  You don't need to see the actual finished paintings since it is the fragments he used to build his paintings in his head that matter here.  If you want to see his paintings, you should be able to find page after page of them online in about a minute, or less, using any visual search engine

I think Pauly Shore is much more talented then people give him credit for.  It is not as easy at it seems to play the character he played in every single one of his films.  But the problem is that he has played the same character in all the movies he made.  Frankly I dont think he made this movie or started his new reality show to restart his career, I think he probably knows that he is a living joke, I feel he is just trying to give people a laugh and I'd say hes done that

One of the most compelling events of the release of Kenneth Lonergan's You Can Count On Me is that it gave visibility to Mark Ruffalo who plays a troubled young man who, unable to deal with the childhood trauma of having lost his parents to a car crash, lives of life of unattached agony and isolation. He's a loner and a drifter, medicating his self-pity with pot and short-lived relationships. His sister Sammy, played wonderfully by Laura Linney, reacts to the same tragedy by being, in many ways, an overresponsible overcontrolling super mom. Two opposite reactions to the same tragedy of course result in a sibling clash. This film shows with great complexity and biting comic insight, the attempt of this brother and sister to shed their defense mechanisms and most importantly reconnect with one another. The ride is never easy in this film. No easy answers are given. Just as important, this film, which deals with the pain of loss, never descends into the maudlin Hallmark movie sap that other films would. Balancing edgy humor and profound psychological insight, Lonergan has written and directed a tale that captures the layers upon layers of psychological complexity that accompany the trauma of loss. Amazingly, he does it in a fast-paced film with scenes that are by turns comic and dramatic. Matthew Broderick, for example, plays a hilarious role of Sammy's neurotic anal-retentive boss at the bank. The conflict between him and Sammy leads to a plot point that I'll let you discover in the film.

But most of all, this film shines because Mark Ruffalo plays such an endearing, sympathetic, sometimes infuriating character. You won't forget him

Phillip Hoffman is searching for purity.  Unfortunately his play has been purchased by a wild Hollywood movie crew, and they are off and shooting in Waterford, Vermont because Main Street is already there.  It is cheaper than building a set.  Then the town folks, New Englanders, dry and pragmatic, mingle with Hollywood slime balls, daft, smooth-talking director, William H. Macy and screen idol, young girl chasing, Alex Baldwin. Sarah J. Parker of Sex in the City fame plays the nymphomaniac actress bedding everyone in sight.  Small town smart girl Rebecca Pigeon and writer Hoffman make the necessary changes in the script and then they fall in love. A scandal threatens the shoot and somebody forgets the mayor's dinner party.  There is plenty of manic fun here.  I recommend for a good laugh. Also, is it just me or is William H. Macy the best actor in the world

Orange County as a movie tries to play it safe. The Director tries to be in tow with what he believes is a good film. I must say for around 50% of the film I was laughing. Jack Black is truly my favourite character in the film. Colin Hanks,the lead actor, is a boring sophisticated person.He also plays Black's brother in the film.

Although Jack Black doesnt have a huge role in it, everytime he's on the screen I seem to forget all the other characters around. I thought the scene in which he jumps into the swimming pool with just his under-shorts was funny. But I defintely feel there are some seven other scenes featuring this master of crazy comedy.

I didnt find Colin Hanks(in the film) inspiration inspiring at all and think he should have gone to Stanford.For the simple reason I believe he didnt have much enough at Orange County to wait for.But then that's a story flaw or story strength(however you perceive it) Come to think of it Colin Hanks character was extremely realistic,polite and believable.Now all the credit in the world to the director for this.However,it was the drugged Jack Black who really tries to get him into something.

Ive seen School Of Rock and I'm sorry for I did not like it as much as I liked Orange County.It's the presence of Jack Black that does it for me.I've seen the film 4 times which is probably why I can't stand Hanks and his goodness.

Anyhow,forget all that , watch the film - rent it , steal it, buy it,download it....just give it a watch.

Cheers

This film is one big joke:  you have all the basics elements of romance (love at first sight, great passion, etc.) and gangster flicks (brutality, dagerous machinations, the mysterious don, etc.), but it is all done with the crudest humor.

It's the kind of thing you either like viserally and immediately "get" or you don't.  That is a matter of taste and expectations.  

I enjoyed it and it took me back to the mid80s, when Nicolson and Turner were in their primes.  The acting is very good, if a bit obviously tongue-in-cheek.

The special was filmed in 1970 and reflected the time period--there's a kind of flower power feel to it but it was well done. Doris and Perry Como's duet together was ok (but Perry seemed to not like Doris flirting with him.) Doris Day has always been under-rated as a singer. Her voice is sheer perfection. It's too bad that Doris didn't do more specials or have a variety/comedy/musical show like Carol Burnett.

We caught this movie on PBS when it first came on, and my daughter was hooked.  It's a change from the regular Arthur animation - this one is computer animated.  She was very intrigued by that fact, and then the story is about a puppy... well there you go!  The story is well written, a little scary at times when the guard dogs are chasing after Pal.  There are even a few catchy tunes as well.  Highly recommend this to every Arthur fan out there

I'm probably going to invest in a re-order of this DVD collection, because I simply have worn this one out. From the "They Call It Pro Football" opening to final gun of Super Bowl X, this collection grips your attention and never lets go. The writing is superb - I especially like NFL 68' - and The highlights... Well, it was when pro football was pro football. 

It was interesting watching teams endure psychological hardships, as was the Case with the Dallas Cowboys of the late 60's- Early 70's. "Next Year's Champions" were the epitome of resiliency.  

"The Championship Chase" was a pure joy to view. If ever there was a peak in John Facenda's narrative career with NFL Films, this was it; though in the alternative, I loved his voice-overs in Super Bowls III, IV, VII, and IX.  

Ed and Steve Sabol Really hit the bulleye with Blair Motion Pictures. I would have loved to see more AFL highlights, but that's just nit-picking. 

GREAT JOB!!!

I think if Charles Bukowski, Dylan Thomas, and Fellini collaborated on a piece of writing, it's possible they would have come up with this screenplay. This movie is exciting because it's soooo different from anything I've ever seen. Deliciously non-linear. The substance abuse aspect is a little overdone but that's the destiny of &quot;artist movies&quot;. I loved hearing the dialog, and Kristofferson's acting is the best I've ever seen by him. Anything so daring and so unconventional will naturally upset some people (like other reviewers here), but if you ask me that only validates the work. If ever I go to New York City, the Hotel Chelsea will be at the top of my list of places to visit. My favorite lines were by the crazy guy in the elevator, who after claiming to have had a conversation with Dylan Thomas said that ghosts naturally reside in places like the Chelsea because people will listen to them there. The DVD extras contain a couple of quirky interviews, one with director Ethan Hawke and the other with Robert Sean Leonard who plays a deeply troubled folksinger in the film

Dracula.  How dare you call yourself a horror fan without even seeing it?  You don't have to like it, but damn it, you should at least see it.  You can thank Dracula for all the gothic imagery that's been used time and time again in movies throughout the years, right up to this very day.  You can also thank Dracula for all the goth chicks running around, and that's either a good or bad thing depending on your tastes.  Dracula's not my favorite movie from Universal's golden era, but I've seen it quite a few times in my life and will probably see it many more before I buy the farm.  Lugosi managed to create THE Dracula.  They even discuss this in the documentary on the disc, but even folks who have never seen the film before instantly get the image of Lugosi's Dracula in mind when someone brings the subject of Dracula up.  Even with all the different actors who've played the role over the years(some turning in wonderful performances, some not so wonderful), they all seem to be in Lugosi's shadow somehow coz he just WAS Dracula.  Lugosi gave a voice to Dracula.  Ever do a Dracula impersonation or hear someone else do one?  What voice did you(or they) use? Lugosi's of course.  However, I don't think I'd like this film half as much if it hadn't had been for Dwight Frye as Renfield.  Frye is rather unappreciated and never became well known outside the horror circle.  He is to the character of Renfield what Lugosi is to Dracula.  Sorry, Tom Waits just didn't cut the mustard for me.  This film is many years old and probably wouldn't be considered frightening by a five year old kid.  In fact, it most likely comes across as silly to younger folks with Lugosi's exaggerated stares, hand movements and dialogue.  Not to mention Frye's overacting as well.  But the fact of the matter is, this movie scared the pants off people in it's time.  When was the last time modern audiences saw a film that truely frightened them?  Who knows, and it's not likely to happen again in our rather desensitized society.  In fact, I doubt most modern moviegoers even have the attention span to sit through this 75 minute film.  Anyhow, you owe it to Bela, Dwight and yourself to check it out.  As for the other films in the set, it's kinda hit and miss, but none of them are bad by any means.  Apparently somewhere along the lines, Dracula fathered two kids(!) coz we have Dracula's Daughter and Son Of Dracula.  Neither movie is all that bad.  Dracula's Daughter actually tries to be a direct sequel to the original film with the daughter trying to rid herself of the vampire curse.  Dracula's son on the other hand seems to enjoy the vampire lifestyle.  Chaney makes a decent enough vampire, but this son didn't inherit his father's suaveness and charisma.  The spanish version is a really cool gem that almost seems more atmospheric than the american version.  House Of Dracula's kind of the odd one out as it's really a sequel to House Of Frankenstein, which itself is a sequel to Frankenstein Meets The Wolf Man.  House of Dracula is best viewed as a double feature with House Of Frankenstein.  Like the Frankenstein and Wolf Man sets, this one has an interesting documentary tracing Dracula from Bram Stoker's novel right up to the Frank Langella film version.  Also sliming his way into this set is Stephen Sommers flapping his gums again about how Dracula influenced his piece of crap Van Helsing movie.  Don't ask me why I watched this feature, maybe I was looking for a reason to get pissed.  Anyhow, with a price tag like this and five Universal classics, it certainly sold me.

The Wolf Man Legacy set a no brainer.Like all the classic Universal Legacy sets the special features are worth the price alone. Jack Pierce's Make up and Wolfman Creation are still the best! This set along with Dracula and Frankenstein Legacy collections enables you to see the entire series in order as sequels to the inferior but still hard to dislike monster rallies they would end with. You still need Abbott and Costello meets Frankenstein to truely complete the series

I don't understand why there are so many low reviews here. This movie was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Also, it was very unique. I think that too many people are trying to project these actions in real life. This movie is FICTION. All the people who gave this movie a bad review should stop trying to see what's real about this movie and just sit back and laugh. This movie was extremely funny!!

I think Woody Allen is the best director currently in the business and I believe his serious-themed movies are the reason.  He excells at making us look at ourselves.  If I'm not mistaken, "Interiors" was his first venture into dramatic movies.  For having led the way, this movie is noteworthy.  However, it is also exemplary in helping define the genre of the Woody Allen movie.  It defines the Woody Allen film by showing us what it is not.  

Woody Allen's greatness is in being able to let us take a critical look at ourselves.  His characters have faults that we share.  Whatever passions that we have fallen prey to, we see them in a new light through Allen's masterful script and direction.  The problem with "Interiors" is that most of us could not relate to the problems that the characters in "Interiors" have.  Many of them belong under the category of mental illness while others are taken too far to the extreme to be relevant to us.  Woody was on the right track but he was overly influenced by Ingar Bergman.  Allen's own style quickly emerged after this movie and we have been the better for it.  

Taken in its' own right, "Interiors" is an above-average movie.  The acting is excellent and the mood of the movie is very tense in a somber manner.  The movie is simply overwhelming and we are left wondering who would ever have been so deranged as to have married into this mess.  These people deserve themselves and that is an observation that applies to no other Woody Allen cast (with the bumbling exception of the cast of "What's New Pussycat?").  

Woody Allen took a turn towards drama and hit a speed bump on the way.  Fortunately, he learned from his experience.

The story is a rather strange mixture of innocence and evil with Mitchum in one of his nastiest roles. It's almost like he was rehearsing for his nastiest role in CAPE FEAR. He meets his match in Lillian Gish's character who stands up to him and is just as courageous and savvy as she is "sweet". In fact, the performances were great all around in this atmospheric film. Charles Laughton, in his only stint at directing, does an excellent job but I think he might have done more with the climax because it did seem that it could have been a little better and have more tension. A very good example of film noir

I had two choices watching this movie...smile or laugh out loud. When I wasn't smiling I was laughing. Keaton's The General is a perfect introduction for those who may shy away from silent movies or who may think silent comics are too exaggerated and mannered. The story line is simple, but what Keaton does with it is genius. 

Johnny Gray (Buster Keaton) is an engineer for the Western and Atlantic Railroad. He has two loves, his engine, the General, and Annabelle Lee (Marion Mack), a fine Southern belle. When war starts, Johnny rushes to enlist but is rejected. He's more valuable to the South as a train engineer than he would be as a soldier. Trouble is, nobody tells him why he was rejected. Worse, Annabelle thinks he may be a coward, and tells him she doesn't want to see him again until he is in uniform. Just then northern spies secretly enter the town to steal the General and take it north, destroying bridges and lines along the way, while a Northern army moves south. Unknowingly, Annabelle Lee finds herself on the train and is kidnapped. Johnny sees the General chugging away and races after it, determined to bring back the General. When he realizes Annabelle Lee is held captive, his resolve knows to bounds.

For the rest of the movie we are on one of the cleverest, fastest, funniest chase movies ever filmed. Keaton creates slapstick situations and sight gags that not only are funny, but that always are in character and which always are part of the specific plot point. And when he rescues Annabelle and realizes how hopeless her Southern belle helplessness can be, his exasperation is matched only by his love. The General features a big cast, a major battle, fleeing armies, a failing dam and a spectacular moment when an engine tries to cross a burning bridge and everything collapses into a river gorge.

Keaton's timing and inventiveness are legendary; so is his risk-taking. He does all his own stunts and some of them were dangerous. In one, he is lying back on the engine's cow catcher while the train is moving at some speed forward. In the distance is a railroad tie across the tracks. Keaton has another railroad tie in his hands. At the last moment he tosses his tie so that the end hits the end of the other tie and they both bounce off the track just as Keaton on the cow catcher passes. This scene has no cutting. The two ties fly off as high as Keaton's head. He could have been killed; instead we laugh. It's amazing that in his older years Keaton could still walk. His body took incredible punishment for the laughs. Try falling hard backwards off a moving flatcar and landing on your back across railroad ties. His ingenuity is extraordinary. How do you build excitement out of an extended train chase? Both engines are behemoths and are on the same track. They can't pass each other. Keaton does it with endless bits of business. In fact, he does manage to reverse the chase at one point in an immensely clever moment combining logic and split-second timing.

What makes Keaton so funny and so contemporary is that he doesn't do double-takes. He barely reacts. But he's no stone-face. Keaton's characters are simply very serious fellows. Things happen to them. His characters don't react to events so much as they overcome them with honesty and good intentions.

This edition of The General comes from Kino Video and looks good. It includes two Keaton short films, The Playhouse (1921) and Cops (1922). In The Playhouse, Keaton portrays all the members of the cast, orchestra and audience in a stage show, including nine members of a minstrel act, the ladies in the audience and a trained chimp. In Cops, he finds himself in a police chase that is one amazing situation after another

This movie is for everyone.  It has romance, It has sports, It has a great soundtrack.  It makes you laugh.  It makes you cry.  It makes you think.  It is a feel good movie.

This is a wonderful show and very true to the band's recent live performances, albeit with a condensed songlist. I give it only 4 stars because I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Winwood and band live and the Sound Stage gig seems just a tad below that experience--which is admittedly an unfair comparison. Nothing to knock about this tidy show by a true virtuoso (actually a band of virtuosos). Consider it 4.5.

This is a fantastic version of TAMING OF THE SHREW.  For anyone who is interested in really studying the text (and hearing it spoken correctly), this is the version for you!  The actors speak clearly and loudly and the main point is that they completely understand what they are saying - (yipee!) They also have an uncanny way of "speaking the speech" which gets it across to the audience as clear as day.  You dont need to understand 'Shakespearean verse' to see this performance.  The actors breeze through this with ease and simplicity and look like they are having a blast - which I belive they are!

Treasure Island has that magical touch to it Walt Disney was famous for. Treasure Island teachers one at a young age not everone is who they seem. Lots of good guys and bad guys and Pirate Treasure leads to a wild ride! This film should be required for all youngsters! There is a special place in my heart for this film. This was Robert Newton's finest hour playing Long John Silver

It is a tragedy that Brandon Lee died while making this film.  Had he lived, the Crow sequels would have been much better.

The Crow is an action packed movie that moves at a quick pace.  It set the standard for the dark cinema of the 1990's.

The Concert in Central Park is not only the best of Simon & Garfunkel's concerts, it is one of the best of anyone's concerts, in my estimation. The crowd was really in to it, and Simon and Garfunkle responded to them and delivered a top notch experience which captured the essence of the best of their music, and the era it was written in.
I have owned the VCR tape for years, and enjoyed it many times, but the signal was beginning to fade, so I was very pleased to see it released on DV

This is the 2000 or so version of the DVD.  This is identical with the VHS version, except it adds two features.  The first is an excellent "Making Of" video from 1996 -- which was re-done with a different host for 2006, but all the "interview" segments are the same.  The second was a "Making Of" video done for the DVD, which doesn't add a whole lot.

Were I to do it again, I'd buy this version, and skip the 2006 "50th anniversary" release.  This is the classic Chuck Jones television "Grinch", in one of the best packages for it.

And the "Horton Hears A Who" is also a Chuck Jones classic.  "A person's a person, no matter how small."

I just finished watching Callie and Son. I got my copy from the Dollar Store and it has another movie (Power Passion and Murder) with Michelle Pfeiffer in it as well... It really wasn't that bad, considering the price I paid. Lindsay Wagner is actually the main character and I think she did a great job, as did most of the actors in this film. The only trouble is the movie lasted about a hour longer than it needed to. With a bit of editing and a bit better script, it would have been a great movie! The end was somewhat unexpected and horrifying... I'd recommend it for someone to watch once, but I wouldn't pay more than I did for it. The DVD quality is really poor, the sound fades in and out, but for what it was, a bargain bin cheapy, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it.

Never in my life have I seen a film dedicated to the subject of Vichy France. I had long read about it but knew very little about the official pronouncements of the collaborationist government. I assumed that The Sorrow and the Pity was strictly a documentary about the French resistance, but was pleasantly surprised by its depth. It describes the Vichy of Petain and Laval quite thoroughly. You may recognize some of Ophuls' interviewees from The World at War (such as Edward Spears), but the stand out individual here was the fellow who volunteered for the SS. I assume he served in the Charlemagne outfit. Frankly, I was surprised he was alive and actually showing his face. His point that the slaughter of 1,600 French sailors by the English was a motivating force for him to join the Germans was something I would have never considered. It seems inconceivable back then for the French to have even hesitated siding with anybody other than England--given the competition--but it is clear that Anglophobia was rampant after "the rout" of May 1940. The most sensational thing about this film is the footage of the collaborationists. It seems as if modern history has made great attempts to cover up just how much the citizenry backed Petain (at first) and looked sympathetically to the Nazis. The speeches, the newsreels, and the photos are incredibly valuable and terribly interesting- especially if you're a history buff. I'd rank this one right up there with Hotel Terminus.

My 2 yr old daughter has been watching the Einstein movies (baby&little) since she was born. We just got this and the second she saw it come in the mail she was running around the house excited, not able to wait for her 5 yr old brother to get home to watch it. She has all the Little Eistein movies except for the one that has the ones from the tv show. She watches them almost everyday and loves when she gets a new one. These are great movies for little kids to learn. She has be larger vocabulary then most 2 yr olds. Little Einstein is a great way for children to learn about a variety of things before they start school.

One could review Kingdom of Heaven on a lot of levels ... as an action packed medieval adventure/romance ... as a vehicle for some of your favorite actors ... or as a statement about humanity's less than perfect attempts to find spiritual meaning in life in a way that doesn't lead to warfare with people of differing points of view.  I was expecting mostly the first two ... and was pleasantly surprised to find a reasonable amount of the third.   My favorite quote from the movie summed up a powerful feeling I've had about spirituality for some time now:

"God will understand, my lord. And if he doesn't, then he is not God and we need not worry."  

Why people so infrequently ask themselves whether the god they believe in really makes sense to their hearts or not, I don't know.  And when I heard these words coming from the screen, I realized "someone out there understands ... we don't find God in books or doctrine or sermons ... we know God in our hearts, or not at all".  This character looked to his heart and knew ... God will understand ... and anyone who doesn't is surely not God, no matter what someone else might claim. 

And if you loved the movie, you'll enjoy this DVD ... it's a classy widescreen handling of a film that's visually rich and deserves to be seen in it's cinematic format. With gorgeous scenery and delightful characters and costuming, I can't imagine watching such a visually appealing film in less than wide screen form.

I worried that the 80s soundtrack would detract from the film's power as a period piece, but it totally didn't.  It was seamless.

My two year old only child adores this DVD so much that she's "adopted" Max as an imaginary younger brother.  There's no flash and no dash, no special effects and no tired slapstick - but there is charm, gentleness, intelligence, humor, and completely accessible characters for the little people in your life.  My daughter views Max and Ruby as such a treat that I used it as a potty training reward - and she's always just as delighted with it as she was the first time she saw it. Ages 18 months through five. Five stars, and then some

Wow!!! I bought this set a couple of months ago and I've been watching each episode little by little, and enjoying each one of them a lot!!! It's interesting to watch Captain Scarlet again, thirty-something years after the last time I watched it back in the late 60s (when I was 7 or 8 years old)!

I was (and still am) a huge fan of the "Thunderbirds" and became quite delighted when this new series from Gerry Anderson first appeared on TV back in the 60s! The quality of Captain Scarlet's special effects obviously got better since the Thunderbirds, and it really makes a huge difference (as far as realism is concerned) to have the marionettes more realistically proportioned! So much so, that there are times when you can almost forget that they are marionettes!

The production still looks fabulous after all these years! The design of vehicles, machines, personal equipment, weapons, buildings, etc. is quite enjoyable, interesting and sometimes even surprising! The "Angels" (both airplanes and pilots) still manage to look amazingly sharp and contemporary!!! Perhaps only the automobiles give you a hint of the series real age, for they look quite dated indeed! However, now it seems a bit funny to see 1965 Chrysler and Ford lookalikes among the futuristic modernism of the series!

Thirty-something years later, most of the episodes plots seem a bit shallow, almost stupid! But one has to remember that this series was meant for children! So, once you remember this you'll be ready to have a great time watching Captain Scarlet and his fellow Spectrum buddies fight the evil Mysterons (led by the sinister looking Captain Black), just as you did when you were still a child!

Spectrum is green!!!...Enjoy it!!

I was like the previous reviewer.  I had rented it and after watching it the first time, purchased it before I had even returned the rental!  I loved the content, it gives one hope and a small glimpse into what lies beyond our human experience.  How lovely to know that there is a life we can barely imagine, waiting to be returned to.  And I didn't learn this fact from the video, I have been studying this subject for many years and already believe, no I KNOW, that there is more that lies beyond this brief stay on Earth.  

This video illustrates it so beautifully with people who have had a glimpse into that wonderful place that is our true Home.  People who are dying yet unafraid as they are being shown what is yet to come.  My own Mother saw her Mother as she died.  She came to take her Home.  There is no specific religion addressed here, only the fact that there is more to life than living and dying.  And that it is something to be totally unafraid of.  In fact physical death is only the beginning of something great; it is a step in the evolution of our souls

My sister and I loved this show growing up (The Huxtables reminded us of our extended family!) The episode where Stevie Wonder came on was our favorite and one of the best episodes (in my opinion).  

..I do question why in Amazon's list of actors at the top of the page (for the Season 2 set)...Joseph C. Philips is the only one listed.  Although he was a guest at one point he did not become a regular till much later.  Regardless, this is a great collection and a must for Cosby fans.

Wow, how nice to watch Sam Cooke's story from beginning to end. Interviews with the family adds a wealth of inside information. I never knew Sam's father was a Chicago minister and of course Sam was the younger one who surprised the family when he first sang! Unfortunate for music that his life was taken so early. After watching this DVD, I bought Sam Cooke music and surpised that some songs are songs I had no idea Sam wrote

This is the final season of Hogan's Heroes. Sgt. Kinchloe (Ivan Dixon) left the series in Season 5 and was replaced by Sgt. Richard Baker (Kenneth Washington). The other original cast members are still up to their wacky antics of outsmarting the Nazis. And, it's still hilarious. 

Here's a run down of the episodes from September 1970 to April 1971: 
Episode 1: Cuisine a la Stalag 13
Episode 2: The Experts
Episode 3: Klink's Masterpiece
Episode 4: Lady Chitterly's Lover: Part 1
Episode 5: Lady Chitterly's Lover: Part 2
Episode 6: The Gestapo Takeover
Episode 7: Kommandant Schultz
Episode 8: Eight O'Clock and All Is Well
Episode 9: The Big Record
Episode 10: It's Dynamite
Episode 11: Operation Tiger
Episode 12: The Big Broadcast
Episode 13: The Gypsy
Episode 14: The Dropouts
Episode 15: Easy Come, Easy Go
Episode 16: The Meister Spy
Episode 17: That's No Lady, That's My Spy
Episode 18: To Russia Without Love
Episode 19: Klink for the Defense
Episode 20: The Kamikazes Are Coming
Episode 21: Kommandant Gertrude
Episode 22: Hogan's Double Life
Episode 23: Look at the Pretty Snowflakes
Episode 24: Rockets or Romance

If you have the previous 5 seasons, hey, you might as well get this one! It was the end of a great TV series that brought a lot of enjoyment to millions. It still does.

I echo most of the previous reviews.
This Hayley Mills vehicle has little to do with the excellent Mary Stewart novel that it shares some of its title with.  Hayley was too young to be the novel's heroine, and so for this film the plot and romance were 'youthened', sanitized (though the novel's romance was also chaste) and also very much dumbed down.  As a featherweight Hayley Mills film, this is harmless, and very much a lesser- Disney film of the 60s.  Just don't expect this to be more than it is and you might enjoy it, even with your kids of today, as a retro laugh

In 2 weeks, I will actually be at the Vatican for my first visit.This wonderful DVD showed me places and things that I will never be able to see as a tourist, but just knowing about the workings of the Vatican will add such a richness of knowledge to visit.  This is a beautifully done 90 min DVD as only National Geographic could have done.

What can a single lie do?  That is the question that is examined in Lillian Hellman's The Children's Hour.

Martha (Shirley Maclaine) and Karen (Audrey Hepburn) run a small boarding school in a small New England town.  Karen is engaged to a local doctor (James Garner).  When Karen punishes a malicious student, the little girl decides to get revenge.  The way the girl does this is repeat a out of context statement made by Martha's aunt (Miriam Hopkins).  To complicate matters, she blackmails another girl (Veronica Cartwright) into confirming the story.

This lie immediately destroys the Martha and Karen's school.  But their life's are destroyed soon thereafter when their slander suit is rejected.  But when the lie exposed it is too little too late.

When the play opened in the late 50's it was daring and very controversial.  When the film opened in 1961, it was still controversial.  But 40 years later, it is not the lesbian story line that is interesting but how little has changed.

Hepburn gives her usual excellent performance and would have gotten an Oscar nomination if she hadn't made Breakfast at Tiffany's that year.  Shirley Maclaine was fresh off her success in The Apartment and was ready to stretch her dramatic legs.  She proved that she could handle drama just as well as comedy.  But it would be 15 years for her to get another great dramatic role (The Turning Point).

Fay Bainter and Miriam Hopkins were major character actors in the 30's and 40's and were given one final chance to show what they had left.  Bainter received an Oscar nomination for this film.

William Wyler had nothing to prove in the 60's yet he continued to select great films with bite that featured women in strong roles.  This was another triumph for him.

With the flip of a coin , it's home I go. Ichi returns to the town he was raised as a child only to find that much has changed since he last left. A good film in the series I gave it five stars because I am bias and think that they all deserve five. This one was a strong introduction into Ichi's personal life along with the background of villians and lost ruffians with little or no way to reedeem their karma. Of course the cane sword is revealed yet again which leads to some good gore. I thought this was an all around good story with lots of underlying plays on greed and deception, and above all ,love ,shame and guilt from Ichi whom never seems to want to be bothered after it all goes down. Much is lost to our friend Ichi and he seems to just lose more.

Many, many years ago when I was a very young woman, I saw my first Carry On movie and went to see every one I could possibly get to.  Then, there were none.  Several years ago, my sister taped a copy of Carry On Cleo for me. I couldn't believe I still roared at the silliness only the Brits can successfully pull off.  It must have been fate that led me to look up "Carry On" on amazon a few months ago.  My heart skipped a beat when The Carry On Collection came up.  I instantly made it mine and have watched most movies several times.  My personal favorites:  Carry On Constable, Carry On Cowboy, and Carry On Cabby.  But they are all good.  I've loaned several movies to a Brit here in the office who has seen all 27-something of the Carry On series and who is now introducing them to his American family.  They love them, too.  If you love double-entendre done to perfection, don't miss this collection

My whole family (ages 7-68) greatly enjoyed all the Horatio Hornblower movies together.  They are well made and great entertainment--a very acessible way to learn about the Napoleonic Wars.  It gives the viewers a real sense of how highly held personal honor and integrity used to be.  We can't wait for A&E to continue the series

Together with 'Odyssey Into the Minds Eye', two of my favorite DVDs in my collection.  They may be watched forever because the constant change of images and inventions cannot be retained by memory. Enormous visual pleasure with appropriate soothing sound track.  There is something healing in this flow of beautiful worlds and mind conceptions

Made by a guy with a super-sized heart, AMERICA is a joyous

Alec Baldwin has always been the best host of SNL (along with Walken and Spacey) and this makes a pretty good case why.

The opening sketch with the press conference about Prince Charles is priceless.  And what could be more demented than "Canteen Boy."  Baldwin is so over-the-top in that that what is a really, really sick joke is actually funny.

But the home runs come with three of the funniest sketches of all time: The Tony Bennet Show (I was seizing during this one), The Joe Pesci Show (with Baldwin doing DeNiro) and the "Zinger" sketch, which just got funnier as it went along.  Even better was the voicemail sketch where he keep re-recording his greeting, only to listen back to it and hear a gay man.

There are a couple of clunkers: "Planet Truth" was just not that funny and maybe two others didn't need to be here.  Including one so-so opening monologue that probably was only included because it included Paul McCartney.

The bonus features include one great sketch that never made it on-air, and a great audio track by Baldwin and the Producer of SNL which provides lots of really, really entertaining stories about the cast and the sketches themselves.

Absolutely hilarious

Alec Baldwin is tied with John Goodman for the second highest appearing host of all time.  So it's only natural that he now has a best of DVD.  This is not the best SNL DVD, but it is still a VERY good one.  If you already have the best of Dana Carvey, Mike Myers, Steve Martin, and Tom Hanks... get this one next.  This DVD has a couple of not-so-good skits, but it makes up for every one.  There are a lot of hilarious skits on the DVD.  I'm not going to list them, but just trust me.  Anyone who gives this less than four stars is OUT OF THEIR MIND.  When I first saw that the Best of Alec Baldwin was out I didn;t have to give it a second thought.  It was at the top of my list, and it should be at the top of yours too.

I have now seen about twenty Asian horror films, and this series definitely ranks among the best.  I have written more extensive reviews under the individual titles, but suffice it to say that these movies make Audition look like a Disney romance.  Bleak, bizarre, and ultra violent, yet surprisingly stylish and intelligent.  This film maker has something to say, and will beat you senseless to make his point.  

In short, if you want to see Ringu #25, stay away from this one.  If you feel a bit more adventurous, I highly recommend this series

I really loved this dvd. There is some information for everybody, beginners as well as advanced. There is also a nice presence from Paul himself who does not hestitate to retrace the painful and private premices of this album. I was not necessarily a huge fan of his music and knew absolutely nothing of his personnal life and of his method in composing. This dvd, without being too personnal, made me discover the craftmanship of the composer and the depth of the man. 
I also enjoyed the discovery of the South-African music, their traditions and influence as described by some of the musician of that country. The many footages of the countryside were a pleasure, which worked perfectly with "Graceland" songs. 
The anecdotes are meaningful, witty, funny, deep, depending on the situation. None of them self-indulgent or egotistical. This DVD is a truly great journey with one of the most influential folk composer's. I would rank this DVD up there with "The Clash, West way to the world" and
"U2, the making of the Joshua tree".

This was my first yoga cd and i found it amazing ... i'm addicted to it. I still cant tell whether its challenging for advanced yogis but as a beginner I really enjoyed it.... it does NOT have all that gibberish spiritual blab on one extreme nor power yoga that seems to really be pseudoyoga on the other extreme .. however this CD is just clear and to the point with good instruction excellent demonstration and fantastic sound tracks.... eric's voice is soothing the instructions are clear and the crew is great. the length is convenient 45 minutes and music is hypnotic. the more i use it the more i feel stronger increase flexibility, breathe more calmly and improve my posture.. in other words dont hesitate just GET IT!!!!!

After many years of sleeping in his coffin, the vampire Lestat awakens only to find that the world has changed and he wants to be a part of it. He gathers a following and becomes a rock star only to find that his music awakens the ancient Queen Akasha and she wants him to become her king. Worth at least a rental!

In my 1-3-2007 review of the Harry Potter DVD series, I said about Alfonso Cuarón's direction of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban that "perhaps Cuarón held back from doing his own thing" because Chris Columbus had directed the previous Harry Potter releases and had oversight to Azkaban. Well the notion that Cuarón was holding back in his Potter directorial was confirmed in my mind after seeing Children of Men.

Cuarón can indeed make a great movie and could have made Azkaban great...but it was just good. Greatness clearly shines through when Cuarón is turned loose with "his own" film, and Children of Men is a good example. 

Children of Men is full of social and political themes as well as an abundance of messages of faith. And this is apparently what Cuarón does best (see 2001 directorial of Oscar nominated Y Tu Mamá También). 

In Children of Men almost 20 years have passed since the last human baby was born. The result? Chaos. Clearly the end of the World is near. Zombies might as well have taken over the Earth, and it was that zombie movie (you know, the good ones, like 28 Days Later [2002] or Dawn of the Dead [2004]) desperation that I was reminded of throughout Children of Men.

Cuarón adapts P.D. James' 1992 novel to the big screen with several liberties, but keeps the message pretty much the same. The story is believably told, and the movie keeps an exciting pace all the way through. 

Clive Owen leads the cast, and this guy just gets better and better in every film that I see him in. He's supported by Julianne Moore, Michael Caine and a bunch of other actors that all turn in A-list performances.

A fair amount of action. Suspense. A very well-told story....Everything that you need to keep you entertained. And, hey, did they actually keep the runtime to less than two hours for Children of Men? You don't get that too often anymore.

For those of you who only saw the new film last year (I bought it with this sight unseen because it looked interesting and it allowed me to get my favorite free shipping deal) here's your chance to see the Original stories of Flicka and her son Thunderhead.  These 3 films which I am told are pretty faithful to Mary O'Hara's novels of the same titles (I have them too but never read them).  The main difference between them and the 2006 remake is that is the central character is named "Ken (rather thank Katy McLaughlin", well at least the kept the same name in the remake) and is played by a young Roddy McDowell in the first 2 films and Robert Arthur in the third.  The reason he probably didn't do "Green Grass" is that the same year (1948) he was making the second big screen version of Robert Louis Stevenson's Kidnapped.  The first film was released on VHS years ago, and both the first 2 had been previously released on DVD to celebrate their 60th anniversaries.  Unfortunately those discs are out of print, albeit some Amazon sellers are still offering them separately or together.  But the copies in this set are exactly the same discs, except for the pictures on the jackets and the labels on the discs.  The text on the back of the boxes and list of chapter stops (on the lists and discs) are exactly the same as the previous releases.  This is also the only way to get all 3 (if you don't count the old copies) as only the first film has been re-released as a separate item (it also marks the first appearance of "Green Grass" on video in any way, shape or form).  By the way, it was also made into the a short lived tv series in 1956 which I doubt we will ever see again.  If you like the books and movies of Anna Sewell's Black Beauty and Walter Farley's Black Stallion and the 2006 remake interests (or interested you), get this set before they go out of print again.

I have waited years for this release to be laser scribed onto DVD--it is here! A very good movie. 

I have to say the Inspector Carson (belonging to an unknown federal agency), character played by Kurtwood Smith is good if not great acting. 

He epitomizes the sort of corrupt fellow we all love to hate. 

His lines in the movie (particularly when he and Border Patrol Agent Bobby Logan, Kris Kristofferson) discuss 'politics' during a stakeout are sheer unadulterated cynicism at the nuttiest best. The conspiracy flakes have probably adopted these lines as their mantra....

Great bit part acting by Rip Torn, Roberts Blossom (as the desert rat), Tess Harper and the young and sultry Jean Smart.

Kris Kristofferson does a great job with his lines and acting capacity and Treat Williams does ok as well.

Anyone who has been in law enforcement--or any other supervisory capacity for that matter--has seen the idiocy and vacuum headedness of the supervisor depicted in the movie of the Border Patrol: Totally inept.

The soundtrack by Tangerine Dream is one of my all time favorites because it fits the movie seamlessly and draws you into the scenes. A must see movie.

I love this old documentary...Capt Clark Gable does an excellent job narrating it, the color footage is a rare treat, and it gives an excellent insight into the day-to-day lives of those from the greatest generation.  It is a real tribute to all the men who flew bombers in WWII and we need to remember their service and sacrifices.  They fought a tougher war and sustained much greater losses than we have in Iraq or Afghanistan, plus they were gone for much longer periods and didn't have the technology such as email or video teleconferencing to keep in touch with their loved ones.  We need to remember them, as we are losing them quickly and soon they may all be gone.  But their legacy remains, and it is films like this one that preserves it

Any Sam Kinison fan needs to own this DVD or video.  You get 2 of Sam's HBO specials plus many special stand up features and Sam's home movies.  The only reason I did not give this box set a 5 star rating is the fact that in the first special feature called: rare stand up(I love the special features on DVDs), Sam told many jokes that were already on the HBO special.  Other than that, Sam's comedy is unlike anything you will see today.  He will really be thought of as a comedy legend.  These DVD's will crack you up.  I would recomend buying the Sam Kinison CDs, Live From Hell, and Have you seen me lately?  The Cd's(just listen to them in your car or at home) will give you the complementary material you need(plus the HBO specials) to truely love Sam Kinison.  He is one of the best, and you will be satisfied with with any purchase.  Just buy 1 CD or DVD and you will be hooked

Having only seen Seinfeld's series on TV that goes by the same name, it was great to have the opportunity to see him as a stand up comedian on DVD.

I'd never seen the DVD before, but some of the material sounded familiar... Perhaps it overlaps with some of the opening and closing live gags that are shown on the Seinfeld show?

You may notice that in his speel about the Chinese he lets the word "shovel" out too soon (when talking about the Chinese's perseverance with chopsticks), and thus spoils the joke a little bit.  But Seinfeld is obviously a master of ad lib, so he managed to work around it.

A thoroughly recommendable DVD

The scene where Eric Idle whines "Oh, you're no fun anymore!" is a deceptive one. 

If anything, these guys are even more fun than before. The second half of Monty Python's Flying Circus's first season is even more polished and mad than the first, continuing the tradition of short skits focused on complete insanity. 

In these episodes, we have: a serial-killer barber; lecherous art critics; an unfortunate man who tries to eat a cathedral, tunnel to Java and jump the English channel; Ken Shabby, every girl's dad's nightmare; thuggish old ladies; bloodthirsty librarians who want to hire a gorilla; camel-spotting; and prime ministers falling through the earth's crust.

The longest and most bizarre skit is one where people mysteriously start turning into Scotsmen and streaming north of the border. Soon "Scotland will be choked with SCOTSMEN," and England is pretty much abandoned. The culprits: tennis-playing, human-devouring blancmanges from the galaxy of Andromeda.

And, of course, the stuff that has become comedy legend: the scene where John Cleese tries to return a dead parrot to a pet store ("It's a stiff! Bereft of
life, it rests in peace!"), and the Lumberjack Song ("I cut down trees. I skip and jump/I like to press wild flowers/I put on women's clothing/And hang around
in bars...").

Of course, no mere description can do justice to the comic brilliance of these  dozens of skits. These five Brits (and one American, who did the little cartoons) created some of the most unabashed, naughty, nasty, and just plain weird comedy ever, which still influences everything from Saturday Night Live to author Jasper Fforde. 

And all of this by men who often dress up as the world's most unattractive girls, with only a tiny budget and minimal cast. The 70s production values are omnipresent, and they are decidedly unpolitically correct. But in a weird way, these only make it even funnier than it would have been otherwise -- the writing and acting are pure, raw, unrefined comedy.     
     
Probably the most memorable actors here are Cleese and Idle. Cleese does his psychotic shrieks better than anyone, as well as having that rubbery lanky body and howling monkey voice. And Eric Idle does a good job as everyone from a housewife to a wannabe mountain climber, while Michael Palin does a brilliant job as people who are timid or insane. 

By this point, the Monty Python guys had polished up their skits and reached a steady plateau of comic brilliance. In other words, it's funny and should be watched

VCI Entertainment presents the original adventure restored to all it's theatrical glory "Long John Silver" (1954) (Dolby digitally remastered) (photographed in Eastman Color), the original "Pirates of the Caribbean" that started it all...the most colorful pirate of all time, roaring across a boundless sea of spectacle in full widescreen Cinemascope...Under director Byron Haskin, producer Joe Kaufmann, based on the characters of Robert Louis Stevenson, screenplay by Martin Rackin, music composed by David Buttolph...the cast include Robert Newton (Long John Silver), Kit Taylor (Jim Hawkins), Connie Gilchrist (Purity Pinker), Lloyd Berrell (Capt. Mendoza, 'El Toro'), Grant Taylor (Patch), Rod Taylor (Israel Hands (as Rodney Taylor), Harvey Adams (Sir Henry Strong), Muriel Steinbeck (Lady Strong), Henry Gilbert (Billy Bowlegs), John Brunskill (Old Stringley), Eric Reiman (Lanky pirate), Harry Hambleton (Big Eric), Syd Chambers (Ned Shill), George Simpson-Lyttle (Capt. Asa MacDougall (as George Simpson-Little), Tony Arpino (Mendoza pirate). . . . .our story has to do with the continuation of "Treasure Island" based on the chronicles of Robert Louis Stevenson...who is this rival known as the pirate Mendoza to Long John Silver...what plan does Silver have to rescue the governor's daughter...how can Jim Hawkins best serve Silver once again in obtaining a swift fast ship to return to the treasure that has been in the back of Silver's mind these past years.....there is a great deal of entertainment for the serious "film-buff"...all courtesy of VCI Entertainment, who in my humble opinion is the best there is in restoring early serials and features like this one.
 
SPECIAL FEATURES:
BIOS:
1. Robert Newton
Birth Date: 6/01/1905 - Shaftsbury, Dorset, England, UK

If you crave action, drama and plenty of adventure then this is the place for all of the above...if you enjoyed this feature check out another as VCI Entertainment presents "Tennessee Partner" (1955) (Dolby digitally remastered), featuring John Payne, Ronald Reagan and Rhonda Fleming is based on a Bret Harte writings as our story takes place in a gold mining town in California where gambler John Payne finds it easier to take money at the poker table than digging for gold...a stranger riding into town played by Ronald Reagan saves Payne...Reagan known as Cowpoke becomes Tennessee's partner....but the place is full of rough characters....the story lines are excellent with outstanding action scenes and production with over an hours worth of entertainment

Great job by VCI Entertainment for releasing the "Long John Silver" (1954), digital transfere with a clean, clear and crisp print...looking forward to more of the same from the ''50s vintage...order your copy now from Amazon or VCI Entertainment, stay tuned once again with a top notch film releases from VCI...so climb aboard  and get ready for some high adventure that only VCI Entertainment (King of the Serials) can deliver...just the way we like 'em!

Shel Natowsky, Ph.D.

This movie is Costner's best, without any hesitation. The performances by Hackman and Sean Young are also flawless. Supporting roles are well honed, as well. The movie has everything you could want in a film...I mean everything! The screenplay is wonderfully written, acted, directed, and presented.

Why is it that movies as superb as this one is cannot be made anymore? Everytime I run it, it never ceases to thrill me and to amaze me. If you want to see a Cold War drama that never ceases to excite and one which moves at a fever's pace, then see this one. Satisfaction guaranteed! Well done people

 During World War II the British Royal Air Force maintained nighttime bombing raids over Europe, while the United States Army Air Corps made large daylight raids. Since the Air Corps was clearly visible, their losses were heavy. American fighter cover did not have sufficient range to accompany the bombers, mainly the B-17 &quot;Flying Fortresses,&quot; mainly from the Eighth Air Force, all the way to their German targets and back, which made them highly vulnerable. We lost 50,000 men in the air over Europe during that war.
 
 This is the fictional story of some of the men who fought that air war.
 
 Brig. Gen. K.C. 'Casey' Dennis (Clark Gable) is in command of a bomber division composed of several groups attempting to destroy the aircraft plants in Germany that are producing the Messerschmidt 262 jet fighter (the first operational jet fighter in the Second World War). The German jet was much faster and better armed than our P-51 'Mustang', P-47 'Thunderbolt', or P-38 'Lightning', our three best escort fighters, and was causing massive losses in the air.
 
 Dennis was obstructed by higher ranking generals who were worried about the reaction of the politicians and newsmen who were reporting the high losses to the American public.
 
 The course of the war was, indeed, in reality, affected by just such considerations, as it is in every war. This is a far better film, and reflected the reality of that particular war far better than I expected. I appreciated it. It was a well-acted, well motivated drama.

The real life base (Dr. Li Ching-Yun, 1677-1933) adds to the wonder and mystery. Many movies usually pale compared to the book; however this movie fits all the criteria of a great classic. Such as excellent film footage for the time, even though some scenes are missing. When I look at the Shangri-La setting some times my mind wanders and I wonder if this was the idea behind the valley in the book "Atlas Shrugged" by Ayn Rand? 

I doubt that they could have picked any better actors for the parts. These actors fit the time and surroundings and were actually believable in the characters they played. A later remake of this movie was o.k. But just did not have the presence of these actors.
 
Now the DVD features: 
Digitally remastered Audio & Anamorphic Video 
Production Notes 
Restoration Before and After Comparison 
Three Deleted Scenes 
Photo Documentary with narration by Historian Kendall Miller 
Many more 

By the way I personally enjoy watching and re-watching this movie.

...that you simply HAVE to see, "Mrs Miniver" being one, a little known film dealing with a fictitious German invasion to a sweet English Village, "Went the day well?" and this film.
 Why so? Because all 3 were made at the start of the war (early 40's) when England stood very much alone in the fight agaisnt Hitler and aggresive facism. Invasion fears were rife, the war effort looked hopeless at times as in Europe, Hitler opposing country after country fell to the German aggressors (not to mention the rampage going on in Africa at the hands of Rommel  aided by the Italian forces under Mussolini's instruction).  England's small island identity stood alone and under threat and was bombed, starved and demoralised into feeling invasion could happen any day. It was quite possibly the darkest of times in English History and these three films capture the flavour of that dispondancy but equally the might of the will to survive and protect, with realistic perfection. In which we serve does this more personally as we know it is based in truth and the characters become dear and well rounded quite quickly, inspiring us to care about these folk from many walks of British life.
 For a modern audience it may seem a little over stoic and sentimental at times but place the emotion in context of the year it was made (1942), and I guarantee you will view it an aching sense of fear and hope which was precisely Coward's plan.
 An absolute gem and a must see, I weep every time I watch it

You might think from the title and the commercials this movie is about a super sexy porn star slut...but it's actually the opposite. I really liked how the movie was done to portray the struggles some girls really have to go through in their carrers and mixed it with the toughness of high school.
This is definately a movie i would reccomend to people over like 16 but only if you want to watch a funny movie about the discovering and strength of two people...This movie is the real thing, i enjoyed it and i think many other people could too

If you can't get enough of zombie comedies this year, I seriously recommend this one, made in the Czech Republic of all places! I saw it at the Tribeca Film Festival (NY) and it was tremendous fun. Bloody, funny, and smart. An intellectual twist on the "secluded retreat" idea - a group gathers at a hotel to do a weekend course about the meaning of their lives. And of course, they're overrun by zombies.

I especially love the way the film weaves between existential exploration and hilarious gore-fest. It works on so many different levels - while your first reaction to it may be mostly visceral, your attention will soon shift to the clever jokes, the interesting characters, and the joyful way it plays with film conventions.

This is a rare and unusual film to come out of the Czech Republic. I was disappointed that it didn't get a theatrical release in the US, so I'm really glad that it's coming out on DVD. Humor/horror fans will not be disappointed!

Whether you're Greek - or whatever - just about anyone can relate to Toula's life. After having deemed herself hopeless for thirty-odd years, then finally meeting the man of her dreams, Toula's real obstacle is surving her family! While his parents are quiet and typical Americans, Toula's clan embraces their roots -- telling strangers the intimate details of their medical histories, roasting a lamb in the front yard, Gramma in the old-country babushka. You'll laugh til you cry, 'cause chances are, you know someone exactly like each of Toula's relatives..

The Cutting Edge is one of those break out feel good movies you can watch anytime and it's still as much fun today as the first time I saw it in 1992.
 
"Doug Dorsey" played with verve by D.B. Sweeney, is a rising hockey star with a bright future ahead him until a freak accident on the ice shatters his chances of playing at the peak of the competitive level. It's not long before Doug is noticed by skating coach "Anton Pamchenko" Roy Dotrice, an affable personality whom the audience gravitates to from the start. Pamchenko brings Mr.Dorsey to the estate of Kate Moseley, Moira Kelly, a would-have been gold medalist at the 1984 Winter Games in Sarajevo. She blamed her former partner for their loss and never fully recovered, you see. Kate has an acerbic tongue that's as sharp as her blades. She has issues welcoming a new partner and Doug is no exeception. The two meet and a hostile alliance is soon formed as they begin practice sessions. Doug isn't used to figure skates and Kate takes full advantage of this by "missing" serveral connections in the routines which cause him to painfully contact the ice. Each time he falls, Kate skates by teasing him uttering "Toe pick." One of my favorite scenes in the movie. Doug is made of quite stern stuff and  soon turns the tables on Kate in a harmless way during an impromtu "hockey game" played on her private indoor rink. 

Having ironed out the roughness, the two become quite polished and a budding romance ensues between them. The question is, do they have what it takes to become 1988 Olympic Champions in pairs figure skating?

The acting is charming and the soundtrack first rate.I would have given it five stars except for the ending, which I won't give away here.
Buy the DVD & CD, you won't be dissappointed

This is one of the great biopic films ever made.  More often than not, film biopics are too rushed.  They try and squeeze in every aspect of their subjects lives, and they end up giving short shrift to the person and their lives.  This is not one of those films.  It just covers Woody Guthrie's adult life, from when he hit the road to when he became a big time folk singer, and his passionate defense of the working man.  The look of the film is deliberate, in that it's washed out.  The hoedown scenes at the camp are some of the best in the film.  They're really lively, where the extras and everyone seem to be really enjoying themselves.  The film has a real genuine feel to it, like you're actually watching real people.  David Carradine is amazing as Woody Guthrie.  He makes you think you're actually watching Woody himself.  He did his own singing and stuntwork on the film.  Ronny Cox is excellent as well, and he does his own singing too (remember, Cox played the man who jammed with the hillbilly in Deliverance).  Randy Quaid and Melinda Dillon offer great supporting roles as well.  This is a fabulous film, and it feels short at 2 1/2 hours.

First of all, let me tell you, this is NOT a date movie.  This is the most brutal graphic rape movie I have ever seen, and also one that lingers in your mind long after it is over.  For me, that's exactly what I want when I see a movie, one that leaves a lasting impression no matter how difficult the impression might be.  I loved this movie, because it is very very well made, and the acting performances are incredible.  Yes, the rapes are unforgiving in every respect, and the misery throughout the film is almost difficult to watch at times.  This is not a gory movie, except for the last ten minutes, it is a very disturbing movie and it does have a fair amount of nudity, however it really needs to.  "The Untold Story" and "Ebola Syndrome" offset much of the carnage with humor, but "Red to Kill" has absolutely NOTHING to smile about.  It is totally and brutally serious from the first frame to the extremely nasty ending.  The story is pretty simple, a psycho-rapist is on the loose and he's going after a mentally retarded young dancer.  In the second graphic rape of the movie he does the deed to the young lady.  Enter a female social worker who tries to help the victim, and dreams up a plan to get even with the rapist after he gets off in court because of a stupid technicality.  Her plan succeeds to a certain extent, but not like she planned it, and the rapist comes after her full force.  The actor who plays the rapist is absolutely sensational, and I might add, the musical score is perfect.  The music adds so much to the all ready existing tension from all the horrific acts.  The actress who plays the retarded girl is also amazing, one of the best performances on film you will ever see.  To end this, this is a must-see movie for fans of this genre, and I'm just getting started myself.  Not the gore associated with the two previous Cat III movies I watched, but something even more terrible and unrelenting, and an uneasy feeling that will not leave you anytime soon after you see it.  "Red to Kill" is flatout a good movie, even considering the subject matter.  I highly recommend it

Hard to believe it took me until now (February 2007) to finally see this excellent movie and witness the brutal language and the violent gun shootings that made Scarface so popular and award-deserving back in the early 80's. I loved this movie. 

It really delivers with the action and the characters are all interesting, especially Tony Montana. A movie that deserves to be as lengthy as it is (over 2 hours). Everyone must see Scarface at least once in their lifetime. It won't disappoint. The ending gave me goosebumps it was *that* good and intense. Watch it now

Why on earth am I giving this movie five stars?  Its plot is minimal.  The script has words and phrases I've never heard, and I'm not sure were ever really used in the real world.  And to top that off, it's more than a little unbelievable.

However, despite all of the possible downsides, I really enjoyed it.  Honestly, I'm normally not into these kinds of films, but it was just good fun.  The humor wasn't disgusting and gross.  The chemistry between the actors made the on screen relationships believable (even if I don't ever buy the whole love at first sight scenario), and there wasn't some great moral constantly being shoved down my throat.

All in all, it was just a fun movie to watch, and it's been a long time since a movie simply put a smile on my face

This is one of the best G3s.  Maybe even the best.  I would have said that it was definitely the best if not for Mr.Malmsteen - the nicest thing one can say about the latter is that he knows his minor and major scales.

But *I* don't want to be nice.  I want to be absolutely and unequivocally cruel when it comes to Malmsteen.

He knows alternate picking, I'll give him that.  But then, so do I - and a million others.  He shouldn't be up there playing with Vai and Satriani solely because he can alternate pick faster than most (not all) people .  And yet he is.

He shows over and over again, in this show, that the only thing he can do with the guitar is shred and shred and shred some more.  That's all. One of the interesting things about this DVD is that one cannot really measure the time between two consecutive shredding runs that Yngwie chooses to execute - it's less than about a second.  And this is an *average* figure.

Enough about Yngwie, though he is the reason I'm writing this review - Satriani is absolutely amazing, as usual, with a brand new rendition of 'Midnight' and a nice solo at the end of 'Starry Night'.

Vai, though, steals the show.  This coming from a guy who prefers Satriani.  But I can't help it - he is really that good.  And better.  'I Know You're Here'(which he plays on a triple neck Jem) contains at least seven new approaches to the same old things that you're taught at guitar school.  It is also the best song Steve Vai has ever written after 'Fire Garden Suite'. 

'Juice' and 'I'm the Hell Outta Here' are also really really really good.

Overall, a great DVD, though you should probably skip the parts with Yngwie in it

How good is Angelina Jolie in this film? It is a testament to this young actor's presence that even as dark and soul sickened and gloriously decaying as her character is, there is not a frame in this film that doesn't feel her infection.

Winona Rider is equally excellent as the psychologically confused (or is it enlightened?) hero forced to navigate the depths of her own psyche. The interplay between these two is somehow able to range from the enchanting to the exquisitely painful; but from beginning to end remains capable of leaving you breathless. One look into Angelina Jolie's eyes and you will see the warm, jaundiced decay of a soul no longer battling with sanity. Fear is born of those eyes when you realize how strongly they've tempted your own tired efforts...even as the second look delves closer to a bleakness bearing fruition beyond existential suicide. 

Presented with the softly rendered and absorbing visualization of a young girl's decent into psychological insecurity; it is a hauntingly supple progression toward the half understood disturbance of what we might have experienced. James Mangold directed this film quite nicely from a very good screenplay; he managed to portray all these young women as young women in turmoil. No melodrama, no over the top sentimentality, just a frank peek into their tumultuous lives.

 
If you've ever questioned your own sanity or escaped periods of exceptional melancholy in your life, this film is certain to trigger old fears. But it is also certain to remind you how exquisite and simple salvation can often be. This film deserves that second look, as well as its painful salvation: a jaundiced beauty whose tragic death is no less healing than the memory of a lost friend. It is a heavy drama, so be forewarned! And a very moving drama at that.

I was surprised to have learn of this very old live performance by Cat Stevens (his name then).  I was well pleased with the quality of the performance format and of the tunes selection.  I was, and still am, a fan of his music.  Nice to see a dvd concert of his.  It is old music, but if you're a fan of the man, you'll enjoy it

The devil's backbone is a horror movie like you've never seen before - a good and intelligent one.. It really is not a horror movie, however, but a story which involves ghosts (or the past) and how they fuel our present actions and decisions.. It is a strange and memorable film from spain which will make you think as much as it scares you.. worth seeing..

I have to admit that I actually enjoyed this movie. I certainly liked it better than "Red Planet". I believe "Mission to Mars" to be the better of the two movies. It has a stellar cast and, I thought, good on screen chemistry between the actors. Most of the special effects were excellent. All in all, it is a good directorial effort by Brian De Palma.

Somehow, however, this has become the movie that viewers love to hate. Well, I am afraid that I disagree, as I found it to be a pretty decent sci-fi move. Of course, I am partial to this genre of film, so perhaps that may account in part for my liking this movie. 

The premise of this movie is simple. A crew is sent on a mission to Mars. The mission is disrupted when three of the four crew members are killed by an unknown energy force emanating from a strange metallic composition in the soil. A new crew of four go on a rescue mission. These four, Tim Robbins, Connie Nielsen, Gary Sinise, and Jerry O'Connell, make up the rescue crew. Due to problems encountered in space, only three of the four make it to Mars.

When they get to Mars, they find the surviving crew member. Debriefing him of the events that led to the destruction of the mission, they discover that the metallic composition in the soil is, in fact, a giant metallic head made in the image of man. Therein lies the mystery. What they eventually discover astounds them and makes one of them decide to go where no man has gone before. The ending is somewhat reminiscent of a combination of the movies, "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "Close Encounters of the Third Kind." So, I ask you, how bad can this movie be? On the contrary, it is actually pretty good. Better yet, it can be watched by the entire family

This is the 6th and last entry in the series Lone Wolf & Cub.  This one not only has a different director than Kenji, who directed 4 of the others, this is the entry most like a comic-book (the series is based on a famous comic book series).
Not that that is bad.

The whole series fluctuated between great period detail, serious themes, and not taking itself too seriously.  It was at once graphic and fantastic, realistic and wildly improbable,  factual and imaginary. serious & silly.  That's what made it so damn interesting.  

Throughout the series the action has taken place in different locales and landscapes of Japan.  Tracing actual historical roads and cities.  Now we end the series in the mountains and the snow, the White Heaven in Hell of the title.

This entry has a lot of stuff going on:  Lord Retsudo of the hated Yagyu Clan, Ogami's arch enemy, sends his last child, a daughter to do in Ogami with her "Falling Dagger" technique. When, predictably, she fails, he goes to an illegitimate son that was abandoned and raised by a mountain tribe.  

The downhill ski battle may not be quite as intense and exciting as the one in Her Majesties Secret Service, but it ain't bad.  That Ogami's Baby Cart guns never seem to need reloading etc. are minor quibbles.  If Ogami doesn't shoot em he always seems able to bifurcate them, behead them, or run em through.  Red sprays all over the white snow.

Anyway, they wind the series up with a bang.  One of the strangest, most unique, and unusual series ever produced anywhere.  Worth it if you don't mind the violence

I just saw this move for the first time in wide screen and it is a much different experience I must say. I think I have figured it out. In some other reviews I think Batricia Birch should have just stayed with the songs and the numbers. I think they should have got another director to get the rest of the movie off the ground. It is somewhat of a good story. I can see why it would be reversed (a guy trying to get the girl, instead of the other way around). You see Eugine in the beginning of the movie stumbling out of the bus. Well if he were a senior in the first one then why is he in the second one???? Also Frenchie is not with the Pink Ladies at all. You see her by herself or just briefly with the other pink ladies in school. I think the chemistry between Stephanie and Michael were worked well together. The songs were written by the same people that wrote the songs for the first movie. So really the bottom line is that they should have gotten a different director altogether. I know I know it is not the first one. But sequels are usually not, but they usually have connections to the first. Grease 2 tried to accomplish with Frenchie and the Tbirds, Pink ladies and all. I am glad they were able to have Eve Arden, Sid Ceaser, plus other great actors of the 50s and 60s like Tab Hunter. Is this movie cheesy???? Yes 
Is it done in less than expected direction???? Yes. Does it have good songs??  Yes (Cool Rider, Reproduction, We'll Always be Together, Girl for all Seasons/Turn Back, and Back to School). The song skits themselves are good and with the same flavor of the first one. After all Kiddies, Patricia Birch did do the choreography for both. 
So, in closing, this movie made it to my DVD collection if for that reason alone. If Grease 2 is going to stink then let it reek. If it has its moments of good cute fun then let it have that. I think if you loved the first Grease then I think you should at least give this one a try.

When this show was on back in the day on Fox I couldnt believe I was actually watching something I could relate to. There doesnt seem to be really that many Tv shows that deal with dark and The Real Life experinces of Real People. If ya ask me when it was on. It was actually something that gave me some relief. I deal everyday with some experinces re-lated to the show. Its somewhat of a constant battle. Enough about me. Im really glad all 3 Seasons are out. And im also glad I didnt have to wait many years either. One thing I didnt like about Fox when Titus was on they kept moveing it around. It wasnt fair for the show. Then the next thing ya know there were some repeats then it was gone. Im not really happy with Fox cause Titus still should be on tv or had a much longer run then it did. I hope Chris shows up in something else soon. Hes got one of those faces ya never forget

This is a well-written, thoughtful film. Charlie Hunnam (Pete) really stands out to me - he's perfectly cast, compelling to watch, and completely sells the mentality of a devoted hometown fan who has the back of all his "mates." It was especially interesting to watch his relationship with Elijah Wood's character evolve. The whole concept of an American being immersed in the British football scene is a unique one and I think it was pulled off really well. The lessons that Elijah Wood learn and the ultimately sentimental tone of the film make this a must-see

In this cynical day and age, it's truly astonishing to see a band rise from the ashes and still sound relevant (not to mention amazing), but how often do you get to see the inside picture offstage?

This film works as a eulogy to Arthur "Killer" Kane, a synopsis of the Dolls' early years, and a buoy for rock 'n' rollers lost at sea.  It's all things to all people, but it's never boring or condescending.  

I would actually recommend this film to lovers of cinema, whether they had any knowledge of the Dolls or not, simply because it's a great story, well told, and stands up to repeated viewings.

This is a good introduction to many off the beaten paths of America.  In fact, the real star of the show, asie from the ubiquitous red Ford Taurus, is the scenery of America itself.  The camera and narrator takes the viewers to many places that have unique characteristics.  Unfortunately there is no interaction with the locals so we do not get a truely complete coverage of each scene, but the point of the series is to give a "Reader's Digest" view of places people can visit.

But excellent photography and the knack for finding out of the way events are the hallmark of this series. Each "trip" is actually a roundabout path that is really serveral "family vacations" combined into a one hour program. This is a great cure for cabin fever in the midst of a winter snowstorm

Hitchcock and Bergman at Their Zenith in Brilliant Thriller

It's difficult to identify the exact pinnacle of Alfred Hitchcock's masterworks, especially as he had a most fruitful period during the 1950's until the 1960 classic "Psycho", but 1946's "Notorious" is arguably his most perfectly crafted and cast film. First, there is a sharp, intensely plotted script by the estimable Ben Hecht that focuses on Alicia Huberman, the daughter of a convicted Nazi spy, and T.R. Devlin, an American agent hired to convince Alicia to spy on a clandestine group of neo-Nazis based in Rio de Janeiro. This means she would have to seduce and eventually marry Alex Sebastian, a key group member who has never gotten over Alicia in his heart.

This triangle is embodied by three stars at the height of their powers. A primarily poker-faced Cary Grant portrays Devlin close to the vest and charismatically hides his emotions under a veil of cold arrogance. In a series of scenes that pierce with a subverted eroticism, Devlin falls in love with Alicia but cannot find the courage to admit that to himself or to her. Claude Rains, on the other hand, imbues Sebastian with such an open romanticism and sad streaks of jealousy that we can actually sympathize with a Nazi war criminal a year after WWII ended, quite a daring feat within the film's historical context.

At the vortex, though, is Ingrid Bergman, who probably gives her most accomplished performance as Alicia. At the time, she was deified as the chaste Mother Superior in Leo McCarey's harmless "The Bells of St. Mary's" with Bing Crosby. Bergman turned a smart corner here as a "loose" woman in love with the bottle until she is transformed by her love for Devlin, at which point, she becomes a stylish decoy to draw the naïve Sebastian to her alluring charms. Ethereally beautiful and constantly pained, she conveys much of her character's feelings through her eyes and subtle facial expressions because she and Grant portray two people who can't admit they desperately want to be together even if her life depends on it. Their failure to communicate leads to Alicia sinking deeper into the morass of some nasty espionage business that ultimately puts her life in jeopardy.

The chemistry between the two legends is palpable, especially in the then-controversial, three-minute kissing sequence that put censors into a tizzy. However, above all, this is a Hitchcock film, the film is filled with his genius for ingenious subjective camerawork and suspenseful set pieces, the latter perfectly illustrated by the party sequence at Sebastian's mansion starting with an unbelievable dolly shot right into Alicia's hand clasping the cellar key, which she passes to Devlin to find what is being hidden in the wine bottles. There are intriguing performances on the sidelines with Louis Calhern as the head of the American agency in Rio and the intimidating Madame Konstantin as Alex's ice-cold mother, both displaying a Machiavellian spirit to get what they want.

The Criterion Collection has done another masterful job with their DVD package, including an alternative audio commentary track featuring renowned Hitchcock scholar Marian Keane providing insightful scene-specific analysis and film historian Rudy Behlmer. As was common with movie hits of the day, the movie was recreated in condensed form for radio, and the 1948 Lux Radio theater adaptation starring the voices of Ingrid Bergman and Joseph Cotten is included as well. There are also lots of still photos, a collection of trailers and teasers, and even production correspondence and script excerpts of deleted scenes and alternate endings for the more anal-retentive among us. This is a true classic and required viewing for any fan of Hitchcock, Bergman, Grant or Rains

I found the film, "Malice" to be a very intriguing and interesting murder mystery. Sure, there are a lot of twist's in the film, however, that is what I found to be very good about this film. Especially the way these twist's were done. There will be no spoilers in this review. The film begin's with murders occuring in a small college town. Andy Safian (Bill Pullman) is a college dean who happens to be suspected of these killings. All circumstantial. Moreover, he is having problems with his wife (Nicole Kidman). Something happens to her, and she blames Andy for this. [To tell you would give away the film]

It seems as if one of Andy's old school friends is now a practicing surgeon (Alec Baldwin). Therefore she decides to leave him and sues both the medical facility that caused her such grief, and the Doctor (Balwin) in particular who caused this grief to her. But there is more to the story than meets the eye. There are several stories going on at once. First, you have a serial killer, secondly you have a distraught wife (Kidman) blaming her ex-husband and his Doctor friend for what has happened to her. But there is more to her than the viewer suspect's. I will leave this to you to discover. The film is better than the reviews warrant. It is a very suspenseful film full of twists. Recommended!

This is an amazing DVD. I read reviews online all the time saying "anyone will like this", but seriously. I even showed it to my mother who laughed. That's a big deal.
This DVD follows these four comedians on their two week tour. Their nightly shows are spliced together with scenes of them in their bus on their way to that particular city.
Also throughout the episodes, it shows the comedians in interviews discussing comedy in America during her "time of need", interpersonal relationships, and anything else they could think of.
This DVD makes me laugh to tears every time. Literally

I have always been a fan of movies that mix special effect animation with live action and the Mask is no exception. I would also have to say that the Mask is one of a kind in terms of unique films. There are many good things about this film aside from the well written script and good acting but I think the one thing that shines the most about the Mask is the special effects and the humor that goes along with it. For those of you who don't know, a big portion of the effects and humor from this movie stem from the old Tex Avery cartoons such as droopy the dog and the lone wolf who lusts after the nightclub dancer in a red dress (this feature is shown in the bonus section of the dvd). These kind of cartoons were always my favorite growing up aside from looney tunes. Getting back on the subject, what I also found thrilling about the Mask is how well the dog Milo was trained to perform certain task. If you have seen this movie, you know what I'm talking about. The training of the dog is also shown in the bonus section of the dvd. The movie itself was a take-off of the comic series of the Mask. Though not quite as dark as the comics, the film itself managed to portray enough adult humor and semi-violence so that the Mask would not be deemed as a children's film hence the PG-13 rating. A big plus to the Mask was how Jim Carrey portrayed the different character traits of Stanley Ipkis and Stanley Ipkis wearing the mask. Another big plus about this movie is the main villain getting hold of the mask. And of course, who can dislike Ben Stein's typical character of a monotone man with sarcastic remarks? Oh, and Cameron Diaz is an absolute babe in this movie as well. As for the dvd, this re-release is an improvement from the previous. You get 5.1 surround sound along with a crisp widescreen picture. The added bonus features are also great and should be viewed to appreciate what was put in to making this movie

good actors, great story... some good action too... this is great movie to help put together the bits and pieces of the stories you've heard about Wild Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane, and more.  It all may be true history, it may be fictional, it may just be myths mixed with fact, but whatever the case, there's more truth than not in this version of the 1870'

I first saw this movie when I was a kid.  It left a good impression.  I am now nearly 50 and a cat came to live with me.  My first female cat.  I named it Mewsette in honor of Judy Garland's character in the movie.  I then searched for the movie on the internet, found it, bought it.  While it's not as good as it was when I was a kid, it is still amusing

This film i have to say is beautiful looking, from the characters to the landscape. Although lacking in numerous and long fight scenes, it does keep things interesting with matrix like effects. The only problem is the love between the two main characters . The movie never lets you feel the love between them , and the girl seems always distant about the love anyway  i mean it is called heart under blade right?  The main ninja character has the coolest power and he always seems troubled to use them it. This film is more of a drama sprinkled with ninja action and beautiful visuals!

'Torzók' ('Abandoned') is a brilliant Hungarian film written and directed by Árpád Sopsits that takes us back to Hungary of 1960 when the oppressive Communist rule altered the lives of everyone, especially children.  The quality of the film is absolutely first rate from story to acting to filming to scoring.  It may be a tough film to absorb and certainly not for the easily offended, but it is a perfectly honed gem of a film that deserves wide audience exposure.

Áron (Tamás Mészáros) is a young lad whose life seems warm at first until suddenly a disease of vision impairment attacks his mother and his parents divorce: the mother is somewhere in a hospital and the father (Sándor Gáspár) beats the boy and eventually turns him over to a rigid orphanage for boys run by cruel taskmasters.  Áron undergoes initiation tactics by his fellow orphans but despite the beatings he is strong enough to survive.  He is befriended when he has his nightmares about his mother's blindness by his friend Atilla (Szabolcs Csizmadia) and the two bond emotionally and physically. In this bleak atmosphere a little light comes from the beautiful young housekeeper Anya (Krisztina Somogyi) but even her contributions are compromised by the cruelty of the staff.  There is one 'teacher' in the orphanage school, Nyitrai (László Gálffi) who has been reduced to his position as an 'imprisoned one' by the government and his sadness is offset by his playing his cello and studying his beloved astronomy. Nyitrai offers  Áron solace and introduces his 'fellow traveler' to the glory of the stars, giving Áron a map of the heavens that Áron cherishes - his window to a world beyond the dark confines of his prison-like orphanage.  He gradually wins over his fellow orphans and when Nyitrai, in the pit of depression for his life situation and the cruelty of the orphanage and the government, hangs himself. This horrid incident drives Áron to organize an escape from the orphanage, an event that is ultimately fractured with a death for which Áron feels responsible. And the end of the film fades into the many possibilities that event could trigger.

The atmosphere created by the stunning cinematography by Péter Szatmári defines the darkness that represents the orphanage well but also suggests the darkness in Hungary of that period.  The musical score by Péter Fejcsik, Tamás Görgényi, Ferenc Toma, and Balázs Winkler is some of the most beautiful composed for the screen, making tremendously effective use of the cello and lower strings.  In all, this is a brilliant piece of filmmaking, acted with depth in every role, and unveiling a portion of history and tragedy too often pushed to the background of our books.  Highly Recommended.  Grady Harp, March 06

Let's face it, Tinseltown has run out of original story lines. That's usually when they turn to remakes. I've seen several remakes over the years, both TV and movie, but this is one of the best remakes I've seen in quite some time. I really enjoyed how they expanded on the original story line. What a lot of people need to understand is that this movie had nothing to do with the TV show and pulled all of it's story from the comic book. If you were never into comics to begin with then you can't appreciate the story line. 

Another thing that I feel is under appreciated about this movie is the CGI. People have to understand that if they got some body builder and slapped green paint on him than the movie would have been a complete waste of time! The amount of man hours that went in to creating the CGI is something to be applauded and appreciated, not mocked and thrown out with the trash. You have to appreciate the movie for the story line and its artistic value. 

Most people were upset with this movie because they thought it was too slow and it should have been more fun and had a lot more action in it.

The story of the Hulk is a sad, depressing, dramatic story! There isn't anything funny about being zapped with radiation and transforming into a mindless brute evertime you get ticked off about something.

The Hulk wasn't meant to be campy, it was meant to be serious. 

My only gripe about this movie is that they could have picked a better actress to play Banner's love interest. The little amount of screen time she was given was completely wasted

I feel some of the other reviews here are unjust and over exagerated. There were two places in the film that in total lasted maybe about five minutes where the sound was distorted, but not badly since you could still understand the characters clearly (ex. one area had a warpy vhs noise and the second had a bit of low static). The costumes were well selected, but I felt a better job could have been done on the rats and the lizard (you can see a gap where the costume ends on his face). This version follows the book well, though it left out a favorite qoute about the taste of the liquid in the first scene that she drinks from the "drink me" bottle. I also felt that the British accents in the movie enhanced the film. I recomend this to fans and people who aren't overly critical of films

As both a big fan of this movie and a film student, I feel that critics have been quick to judge this film as bad trash. This film has a sexy edge to it, that many other films in the "teen film" genre dare to exhibit. New Best Friend fullfills a fantasy for those girls who secretly desire to live dangerously and party every night, without it actually becoming a reality. The house is every girl's dream, and these girls are alluring and suavely tempting. The acting is far from terrible, and it was great to see Meredith Monroe  in a more sophisticated and darker role than her role as Andie in Dawson's Creek. Dominique Swain once again puts in an A+ effort for her role as the cheeky deviant Sydney. For anyone who loved films like Tart and Cruel intentions,this is the film for you.

RKO Radio Pictures present "BORN TO KILL" (1947) (92 mins/B&W) (Dolby digitally remastered) --- Starring Claire Trevor, Lawrence Tierney, Walter Slezak, Audrey Long & Phillip Terry --- Directed by Robert Wise and released in May 3, 1947, our story line and film, Uncompromising film noir which sees psychopath Tierney marry wealthy girl Long, only to feel more in common with the black sheep of the family, his wife's sister (Trevor). Deliciously dark and directed with enthusiasm by Wise before he'd made it big, Born to Kill is a genuine oddity which explores the dark side of sexuality without moralizing, with the bonus of a cracking murder plot to add some spice. Tierney pitches his performance just right ... The film sits well with all those minor noir classics the late 40's and early 50's with apparent ease: Wise's own "The Set-Up"; Anthony Mann's "Raw Deal" and the "T-Men", "Kiss Of Death", and Ray's masterly debut, "They Live By Night".

Under Robert Wise  (Director), Herman Schlom  (Producer), Eve Greene  (Screenwriter), James Gunn  (Book Author), Richard Macaulay  (Screenwriter), Robert de Grasse  (Cinematographer), Constantin Bakaleinikoff  (Musical Direction/Supervision), Paul Sawtell  (Composer (Music Score), Les Millbrook  (Editor), Albert S. D'Agostino  (Art Director), Walter E. Keller  (Art Director), Sid Rogell  (Executive Producer), Darrell Silvera  (Set Designer), John Sturtevant  (Set Designer), Edward Stevenson  (Costume Designer), Russell A. Cully  (Special Effects) - - - - the cast includes Lawrence Tierney  (Sam Wild), Claire Trevor  (Helen Trent), Walter Slezak  (Arnold Amett), Phillip Terry  (Fred Grover), Audrey Long  (Georgia Staples), Elisha Cook, Jr.  (Marty Waterman), Isabel Jewell  (Laury Palmer), Esther Howard  (Mrs. Kraft), Kathryn Card  (Grace), Tony Barrett  (Danny), Grandon Rhodes  (Inspector Wilson), Jason Robards, Sr.  (Conductor), Netta Packer  (Mrs Perth), Sammy Shack  (Crap Dealer), Philip Warren  (Chauffeur), Tommy Noonan  (Bellboy), Napoleon Whiting  (Porter), Ruth Brennan  (Sally), Sayre Dearing  (Crap Dealer), Jean Fenwick  (Margaret Macy), Lee Frederick  (Desk Clerk), Ellen Corby  (2nd Maid), Demetrius Alexis  (Maitre d'Hotel), Al Murphy  (Cab Driver), Sam Lufkin  (Crap Dealer), Beatrice Maude  (Cook), Ben Frommer  (Delivery Boy), Perc Launders  (Detective Bryson), Martha Hyer  (Maid)  - - - - - Film noir is a cinematic term used primarily to describe Hollywood crime dramas that set their protagonists in a world perceived as inherently corrupt and unsympathetic...Hollywood's classic film noir period is generally regarded as stretching from the early 1940s to the late 1950s...Film noir of this era is associated with a low-key black-and-white visual style that has roots in German Expressionist cinematography, while many of the prototypical stories and much of the attitude of classic noir derive from the hard-boiled school of crime fiction that emerged in the United States during the Depression...the term film noir (French for "black film"), first applied to Hollywood movies by French critic Nino Frank in 1946, was unknown to most of the American filmmakers and actors while they were creating the classic film noirs..the canon of film noir was defined in retrospect by film historians and critics; many of those involved in the making of film noir later professed to be unaware at the time of having created a distinctive type of film ... featuring top performances from the '40s and '50s with outstanding drama and screenplays, along with a wonderful cast and supporting actors to bring it all together ... another winner from the vaults of almost forgotten film noir gems

Tihs DVD truly has incredible camerawork, and fully illustrates the intelligence and beauty of dolphins, but some things people don't realize about dolphins kept in captivity need to be told.  PLEASE take the time to read this.

Many dolphins you see in aquariums and swim-with programs and circuses around the world often come from brutal drive hunts, during which dolphins are rounded up into very tight nets concealing them, and are dragged ashore making it easier to violently wrestle them into slings.  These dolphins captured, while they may be smiling in appearance (which is the way their faces were genetically designed), are ripped away from their beloved podmates and torn from their environment.  How would you like to be a dolphin who once lived in a vast sea of blue and then suddenly be taken into a shallow pool of water, forced to live with the loud sounds of people screaming, the filtration system running, and very little space to swim?
In the process of capturing dolphins for human entertainment, many die in the process.  Stress severely affects a dolphin's body, and many suffer irreperable damage to their hearts in the execution.  On top of that, dependent calves (baby dolphins) who have spent the entirety of their lives with their mothers, often get torn from them, leaving them helpless, even if they are released.  

While you can clearly see in the film that many of the dolphins appear to be having fun, would it not be too much to consider the fact that they might miss their former companions?  Are they really happier stuck in a cement tank forced to perform tricks in order to be fed?  Keep this in mind the next time you visit an aquarium or swim-with program.  For dolphins captured in Japan, the industry has been given permits to slaughter a number of them needlessly in the process by the government.

I believe this film spends too little time in the beginning addressing the human threat to dolphins.  Over 7,000,000 dolphins have died at the hands of humans since the late 1950s.  I think a few minutes at the beginning of the film doesn't nearly suit the need to inform the audience of the issue.  Tuna fisheries, whose products are falsely labeled as "dolphin-safe" (there are established 'KILL MINIMUMS' now for tuna companies) need to be exposed.  Intentional killings in Japan (especially), South America, and all over the world need to be publicized.  But I also understand that this is a family film, mainly, but I think it is also important to inform young viewers of the problems dolphins face with humans.  They are the ones who will need to make the difference in the future.

Please just remember this next time you watch this film.  While dolphins are valued by many, they are targeted by many as well as a way of easy money-making.

This film is more of a sugar-coated production, although it certainly is beautiful, as are the dolphins seen in the flim.  I would recommend a film entitled "Dolphin Defender" for those who seek some informative footage behind the scenes to what really happens to dolphins in drive hunts.

I bought The Homecoming 3-4yrs ago, and I watch it every year at Christmas.  I found it on the floor in my house after Hurricane Katrina, still in the package it came in.  I brought the DVD to my new place of residence and popped it in the player and it has been playing since I found it.  When ever I'm down it watch it, so I can relieve some of my own childhood memories of the season.  It is a must see for the young and old

This movie is very simple, and unique. It's the kind of love story which you really believe in while you're watching because it doesn't feel phony. This can be credited to the acting, the situation, and the plot as well. This isn't about a man falling madly in love with a beautiful woman and then spending his life missing her. That's all been done, and that's what makes this film a breath of fresh air. River Phoenix shows why he is missed by so many, and really allows you to connect with his character. I recomend this to anyone who wants to see love put to true art, and be touched at the same time

Eddie and Rose are meant to be in Nicole Savoca's "Dogfight."

This is a warm and wonderful movie; those of us who have seen it have an obligation to spread the word to as many others as we can. 
 
It's sad that so few people have heard of or seen Dogfight. How a film that was so universally well liked by viewers and critics managed to completely slip under the radar of popular attention is a mystery to me.
 
Many others have synopsized the story, so I wont be repetitive. I will say that this movie's genius is in its acting. River Phoenix and Lili Taylor have the chemistry of childhood friends, and it shows in scene after scene. River gives the most endearing performance of his career in this film as the affectedly coarse, absurdly young "jarhead," Eddie, about to ship out to Vietnam. His coming of age is the narrative behind this movie, while Rose's idealism and grace throughout the humiliating ordeal of the "dogfight" make her character angelic. The poignancy of the closing scene, in which Eddie embraces Rose, in tears,  after having lost his three best friends during the Vietnam war will stay with you for a long time. 
 
Dogfight is a unique and touching film. It harkens to a sensibility which is dissatisfied with much of the droll offered as "romantic" by Hollywood today.

I'm not sure why I never watched "Ghost" before until last night.  For some reason, I didn't pay much heed to it when it was first released and never thought it was worth watching on TV.  I'm glad I gave it a chance because this is a GOOD movie.  What makes it good is its' skillful mixture of suspense, romance, comedy, and the supernatural.  That would seem to be too much to tackle for one movie but we get it all in the right balance.  I was drawn rather quickly into the movie and got to where I couldn't wait to see what was coming next.  There were a few "convenient" capabilities that these ghosts had that were necessary for the story to work.  I'm a rather pragmatic person but, by the time these things came up, I was so caught up in the story that I WANTED these things to be possible.  

Obviously, the writer and director deserve accolades for their work and the actors do as well.  I wanted to make note of the quality of acting because it was probably the cast that left me uninterested in watching "Ghost".  I was prepared to be unimpressed in particular with Whoopie Goldberg so I want to confess that I thought her Best Supporting Actress Oscar was well-deserved.  I figure that I was one of the last persons in America to see "Ghost" but if there are others of you out there who still haven't seen it, give it a look; it's well worth it

OK, I rounded up to 4 stars. This really isn't bad, though.

It's an idiom that most American viewers won't be familiar with. The major characters are Kuan Yin, Confucius, and a flock of other gods, godlings, immortals, buddhas, figures from myth, and other well-known figures and stereotypes from the Chinese pantheon. There are the flying heroes, improbable weapons, and acting at least on a par with the Dr. Who series. In other words, lots of viewers will see it as alien, disconnected, and amateurish, as well as being filled overly convenient miracles.

But it's not in the Western idiom, so parts of it have to be taken in their own terms. And it has the look of a low-budget film, so you won't see effects on the Star Wars scale. And it is a bit cheesy and over-the-top, which is part of the appeal.

The fights are bloodless, the romance is chaste, and all but the youngest kids will understand the characters. If you don't take it or yourself too seriously, there's a lot of fun in this one.

If your a fan of progressive rock, you probably already know how good this CD is. In my mind it is the single greatest CD of all time (followed closely by Operation Mindcrime, any of the great Pink Floyd and Rush records)

My only complaint on this DVD, is the sound. I was at this show and the sound at the theater was great. Somewhere, it didn't transfer to the recording. It is not the worst thing I have ever heard, but it doesn't show the bands power live. 

Every other aspect of this DVD is well worth the price. I would not want to be with out it.

it gets laughs in its comicness in certain scenes
it gets shocks
like the beginning war scenes and the fight scenes
it gets more interesting as the plot unravels
great actors picked for such roles
the perfect killing machines
one insane in the brain
and one out to save lives that shouldn't be lost in the first place
the diner scene where the soldier orders alot of food and keeps eating and the guy says how you gonna pay for this and the soldier says "I just want to eat, I don't wanna hurt you, then he kicks ass while still enjoying his meal. and his reporter female friend comes in and says "good meal" as a question that is. and he says without words "makes a happy sigh" that's hilarious. and how she looks around and see everyone who got their ass kicked from keeping him from eating his food
priceless movie
worth the watch again and again
I'm glad I saw this on tv when I was younger
and I'm glad I got this on dv

As Socrates once said "I drank what?"

Frank Bigelow (Edmond O'Brien, you may remember him as Winston Smith in `1984' 1956) realizes after he had a one night fling that he does not feel so good. He feels bad enough to see a doctor. Yep he is D.O.A. (Dead On Arrival) as he has been poisoned and only has a little time left to live. 

Obsessed with finding out who did it and why, Frank has to reconstruct his wild night. Will he find out in time? If so what then?

Robert Ryan made a number of Westerns during the 1950s and '60s, but always he seemed to be overshadowed by other actors in the genre. Nevertheless, who can forget THE WILD BUNCH or his magnificent portrayal of "old man Clanton" in the seriously underrated HOUR OF THE GUN (with James Garner). And his self-effacing determination is equally unforgettable in THE DAY OF THE OUTLAW. Now one of his best roles, as the straight-arrow sheriff in THE PROUD ONES is on DVD and available at a very reasonable price. Finally.  THE PROUD ONES is perhaps director Robert Webb's finest picture, combining great action scenes and plot twists, taught dialogue, and a superior cast that includes not only Ryan, but Jeffrey Hunter, Walter Brennan, Virginia Mayo, and Robert Middleton. Minor roles are given attention as well, especially Arthur O'Connell (as Ryan's deputy) and, important thematically, the wonderful Paul Burns, who plays the town drunk and panhandler....Hunter, when he finally assumes the mantle of sheriff, will give alms to Burns at the finish of the movie, just as Ryan did at the beginning, when he was sheriff. This touch dramatically completes the movie and has much to say about Hunter's increased maturity.  THE PROUD ONES is a superb movie, with a great story...it will repay re-viewing. Unlike some Westerns, I don't tire of watching it periodically. It is that good...

Ray Sawyer (Rick Cramer), Agnes Bruckner (Eden), Laura Ramsey (Rachel), Jonathan Jackson (Eric), and D.J. Cotrana (Sean) star in this scary and bloody slasher movie.

Eric and Eden are going through any typical teen romance; going steady one minute, broken up the next.  Eden works at a local truck stop as a waitress. One evening, Ray pulls into the truck stop to get some food.  Known as the local nut case, Ray has few friends and owns a filling station on the edge of town.  Later that same evening, Ray comes upon Eric and Eden on a lonely bridge.  Swerving to miss Eric's jeep, Ray instead crashes into an on-coming car.  The impact of the crash sends the car slamming through the guardrail of the bridge.  The car is now teetering precariously on the side of the bridge. Ray jumps from his truck and goes to the aid of the woman inside the car.  After pulling her to safety, Ray goes back inside to retrieve a suitcase that the woman told him about.  However, both Ray and the car tumble over the side of the bridge and into the water below.  To make matters worse, the suitcase is full of poisonous snakes, who immediately begin striking at Ray.  All that can be heard are Ray's screams as the car sinks.

Ray's body is pulled from the water and taken to the local morgue.  But it doesn't remain there for long.  It seems that the woman in the car was a Voodoo priestess, and the snakes were used to "cleanse" people by drawing the evil out of them.  Now, the evil venom is flowing through Ray.  Now begins a bloodbath of carnage as Ray, possessed by the power of the evil venom flowing through him, begins to stalk unsuspecting victims.  One by one, he exacts his revenge on Eden's friends until only Eden remains.  Who will win this final showdown; Ray or Eden?

I've always been a big fan of slasher-type films, and characters like Freddy from the "Nightmare on Elm Street" series, as well as Jason from "Friday the 13th".  Ray Sawyer fits the mold of the typical slasher perfectly. The motives are the same; kill as many teenagers as possible, and Ray succeeds in this very well.  I thought the story involving voodoo was well-conceived.  The special effects were good, too.

I recommend this movie to horror and slasher fans.  Although the movie is short (only about 80 minutes), there's lots of slashing in a short amount of time.  If you enjoy a good slasher flick, then don't miss "Venom".

"Venom " is one of those movies I thought I would hate because I heard so much negativity about it but I really enjoyed it ,being a fan of the 70's and 80's slashers I crave newer versions because I have seen all the other ones over and over again.
Venom did NOT disappoint me.
It starts off with action and never lets up.I found it to be one of my favorite new horror/slasher flicks,The voodoo angle was good but not overplayed ,I'm simple in  that I want to see a killer with an axe , machete butcher knife etc not a bunch of supernatural mumbo jumbo..I don't want to have to wonder" was that a dream or was it real~!!" As so many movies these days play off of.
Give me an old fashioned slice and dice and I'm in heaven.and Venom gave me that , So I hope to see Venom 2 ,if so ,I'm there

(For the record, Mr Jangles used the hook & Chain before Kane in see No Evil...)

This DVD version of the movie looks great and is very enjoyable.  Hayley Mills is her usual irrepressible self, and the supporting cast is top notch. The feline actor in particular!  ;)

I don't quite understand the anger from some other reviewers about the fullscreen format.  It didn't bother me at all.  Disappointment I could understand, but this kind of vitriol?  It's still a very watchable and enjoyable film for all ages, and I found it a refreshing change from the dumbed-down "kid's" movies they tend to make these days.  Adults will enjoy the suspenseful story, retro style, and feline antics just as much as kids will.  I'd skip the remake and get the original

War exposed some violence simmering within one Gulf War veteran.  Christian Bale is electrifying as Jim, a tough-minded ex-Ranger whose brutal nature didn't subside after his return home to LA.
They say war changes a man.  This might be evident here, but it feels more like the fighting only unleashed the demons inside of Jim.  Along with his buddy Mike(Freddy Rodriguez), the two tear through the town, bingeing on drugs and alcohol. 
Their is no deep plot here, just a couple of ruffians going around town looking for jobs.  But it is a great character study, watching Jim self-destruct.  Bale is great in this type of role, like he was in American Psycho or The Machinist.  I liked this movie much more than Training Day, which this director previously wrote the screenplay for

When Paul McCartney goes on tour to connect with his beloved audience, it usually for more than just the average "Oh, I have an album to promote, let me go on tour".

His 1989 tour was Paul's first time onstage in many years, and he used it to show he not only still had the energy and vigor he posssessed during his Beatles & Wings years, but he also still was able to create a deep, personal bond with his audience like few if any other artists can. This spawned the excellent double live album "Tripping The Live Fantastic" as well as the exciting concert movie "Get Back".

His 2002 American tour was a chance for Paul to use the healing power of music to ease the seething sadness caused by the horrific attacks on September 11th. The cd and dvd "Back In The U.S." were released to commemorate this wonderful act of musical philanthropy.

In 2005, Paul did something that had long been awaited since The Beatles first hit. Ever since The Cold War, The Beatles were a huge phenemenon in Russia. However, there Communist government considered their music alien propoganda, and their music was outlawed. Still, the Russian citizens got their hands on The Beatles' recordings any way they could, and they felt a great deal of inspiration from them, making them belive there was a free world beyond the Iron Curtain.

Over 40 years later, Paul ventured to Moscow to perform a historic concert in Red Square to hundreds of thousands of devoted fans who had been waiting all their lives for this moment. The concert was filmed and was aired on A & E as "Paul McCartney - Live In Red Square".

This is quite simply an excellent concert movie. Paul and his band are in top form. Paul clearly wanted to give the Russian fans a night they'd never forget, pouring his heart and soul as well as his boundless energy into old warhorses such as "Band On The Run", "Live And Let Die", "Back In The U.S.S.R.", "Hey Jude" and "Let It Be", as well as performing rarely heard numbers such as "Two Of Us", "I've Just Seen A Face" and "Let 'Em In".

Mixed in with the live performances are commentaries by scholars and fans on how The Beatles' music had such a connection with the Russians during the Cold War, and why they still remained so popular. These interviews manage to come off as insightful and entertaining rather than annoying and unneccessary, even when they occasionally cut off certain numbers.

As an added bonus, we get another concert of Paul in St. Petersburg. This is once again an excellent, energetic and fun show that shows why Paul to this day remains quite possibly the most beloved man in the music world.

The sound and picture quality are excellent, and the special features are a nice treat. "Live In Red Square" is an excellent dvd that belongs in everyone's collection

There are two story lines here, one an unqualified celebration of the state of girls' prep sports after a generation of Title IX's beneficial impact, and another the very qualified consideration of the state of some individual girls' athletic lives after a generation of Title IX's less beneficial side-effects.  Heartbreak, fury, exultation are the viewer's rewards.  Only quibble is that the climactic game was documented in too abbreviated a manner

This is a film like none other you have ever seen, and as such you'll either love it, or hate it.

From the "reviews" posted on Amazon, I've come to the conclusion that the people who hate it are simply people who don't have the intelligence to have understood a word of it.

This film is not literal.  Learn to *think* about what you are watching.  To interpret archetypes, symbolism and metaphor.

A clue: the Lady character is named STORY.  Now why might that be?

And why would she require a VESSEL before taking flight into the world?

And what precisely does the wolf-like Scrunt represent?

And why are there THREE of those monkeys?

This film is a love letter from one creative person to all other creatives in the world.  If you aren't an artist, you probably won't get it at all, and might even post a scathing review of it on sites such as this.  

But that achieves nothing but illustrate how stupid you truly are to the artistic souls that will understand everything this film says, and love every beautiful, unique and visionary second of it.

Magical.

Like her legendary mother, nobody around today takes command of the stage like Liza Minnelli and this legendary event at New York's Radio City Music Hall clearly illustrates this...always a five star event in concert, I have been fortunate to experience this thrilling and amazing performer numerous times in concert from 1970 to 2005 and I am here to say that she has still got it and always will!!! In recent years for some silly reason that I don't get, the media has tried to damage Liza's artistic credibility but it doesn't work when Liza takes to the stage and shows sold out audiences with her soulful singing and great performing skills what she is all about and that she is and always will be a true legendary Superstar...numerous standing ovations later it is clear that Liza is going to be around for a long time to come and this tremendous concert is a keeper...BRAVO Liza and keep on rocking!!

It's just like the Hit TV Show!  In fact they probably got the idea for the TV show from this movie. Actually I thought it was more of a comedy than anything. I saw it on the "WE" network.
It's worth the price if you feel like buying it.

Less technicolor and more monochromatic than its predecessor, "In Like Flint" still uses broad strokes to great advantage in poking fun at the Bond films.  The indomitable Derek Flint returns to save the world, this time from a bevy of beauties who simultaneously raise the ire of the world's women while replacing powerful males with surgically-altered substitutes (leading to, perhaps, the most prescient line of dialogue in any 1960s film--upon discovering that the man in the White House is not who he seems to be, a disbelieving Flint says, "An actor as president?").  That is, until a renegade ZOWIE general (Steve Inhat) decides it's his turn to take the reins of power.  The delightful Lee J. Cobb is back as Flint's curmudgeonly boss, Cramden, as are the secret agent's posse of female admirers, and TV's Batgirl, Yvonne Craig, even shows up as a Russian ballerina.  "In Like Flint" feels more grown up than the previous film, partly because the lighting and cinematography are more stark and partly because the humor is sometimes more rooted in satire than parody.  Notions like the Red Scare being a feint to the very real dangers of corruption from within and the beauty industry actually having our worst interests in mind--and charging a premium for them--are slipped in with more obvious gags involving oversized eyebrows, cross-dressing, and the bouncing sing-a-long ball.  Only the crankiest among us are likely to find the juvenile sexism of either Flint film worth comment, as it's a staple of the genre, meaning that the biggest weakness here is the same as the earlier effort:  a no-frills DVD.

It's a funny concept to begin with, and Stiller is hilarious. Then you throw in Rip Torn (probably the best film Judas, among his many credits over the years), and these cameos that are out of control (Shatner, Armstrong, Norris) and you've got a comic classic.

A wonderful movie which deserved all the awards which were bestowed upon it.  It is refreshing to view great movies with wonderful stories minus bad language and nudity.  

As a big fan of Greer Garson, I must comment on Jane Bedinger's review in which she claimed that Ms. Garson was having an "affair" with the actor who played her son.  Ms. Garson fell in love with and married Richard Ney about a year after the movie was made.  I don't see how Ms. Bedinger could consider this an "affair".

Is there anything more American then apple pie, baseball or a good Rock Hudson/Doris Day Film? It's always been such a treat to curl up with them and the third essential player, Tony Randall. Rock is always doing something to infuriate Doris. He's her worst nightmare. And what's more, he pretends to be someone else that Doris falls for head over heals until the gig is up. Then she's out for revenge, but love always wins out. Ahhhh such feel good, laugh out loud stuff.
 
So in this one from 1961 "Lover Come Back", Madison Ave is the setting. Advertising is the game of Carol Templeton and rival Jerry Webster. But Jerry is such a cad and a playboy. He steals big clients right from under her by wining and dining them, throwing raucous parties and getting the girl for them. Carol on the other hand, does things a little different. She's virtuous and business like. When he trumps her cards once too often, she plans to get a little underhanded herself. Trying to win over the scientist that is going to invent a new product for our guy Rock, Doris, who has never met Webster(as is always the case), mistakes him for...you guessed it..the shy, retiring, needy nerdy scientist. Jerry, in true form goes along with it, and tries to woo Carol into his bed. And the fun continues...
 
Doris is marvelous. Watch her face. So many different emotions she goes through. From being Exasperated, to being in love, she does it all. She's simply a joy. Rock matches her perfectly with his pretenses, and has a way with the dialogue that just says Rock!  As mentioned Tony Randall is always the third part to the equation that makes these films such classic fun. Here he is the President of the ad firm and Jerry's boss, but hasn't a clue as to what's going on. He does this quite well.Meanwhile, the fun doesn't end with Doris and Rock. The race to make a new product, VIP! is causing quite a few explosions and when the product is finally ready for testing...well you just have to see for yourself!

The rest of the cast is quite a roll call. Ann B Davis, Delbert Mann, Donna Douglas(the beautiful Ellie Mae Clampett), Edie Adams, Jack Albertson, Jack Oakie, Joe Flynn, Richard Deacon,wow... the list goes on.
The transfer to DVD looks great. Picture clear, colors good.The film is presented in Anamorphic widescreen 1.85:1 The sound is in Dol Dig 2.0(MONO), but this isn't an action flick, so it's fine.There are caption in English(a nod to Universal there), subtitles in Spanish and French. There are no features of any kind other than scene selections.

This film is a treasure from the 60's vault. Doris' outfits alone are smashing, and NYC in the 60's too. This film has no rating on the case, but I would say PG. There are some adult situations, but all done in tasteful fun(can you imagine Doris Day, doing anything else, even if she tried?).The other two films that this trio delight us with is "Pillow Talk" and "Send Me No Flowers"

Well, I'm off to watch another Day/Hudson/Randall film. I've got my bowl of VIP and ready for a fun evening.....Lauri

After starting my 9/11 odyssey from ignorance to full blown "WHAT!" after "Loose Change - 2nd Ed" last year, I've watched and or read just about them all.  9/11: Press for Truth comes out on top, in my humble opinion, as the best 9/11 timeline presentation out there.  Nothing included that isn't in the mainstream press - just on the back page, and spread out over five years.  The film makes few of the outright accusations that "Loose Change 2nd - Ed" does towards any of the events or people involved in 9/11, but delivers more of damning argument that we've been lied to - there weren't just mistakes made, but distortions and deceit at the highest levels of our government.  I hope that we, the people, finally demand a real investigation and the truth comes out.  And the bad guys pay. Good movie

Either you get on the train or you don't... And as long as you continue to get on the train, you'll grasp the meaning of Christmas. The TRUE meaning of Christmas. But you have to be willing to get on. 

This movie was a great adaptation of the classic story. I must admit I was a tad bit wigged out by the animation. It was just oogey in some ways. Realistic at times and, at other times, so unbelievably fake...

I couldn't decide if I liked the animation or not. Still can't. But the story itself is worth the struggle I had with the animation. 

Get on board! You'll be glad you did.

The third movie has nothing to do with book 3. If you loved the books, you will find this movie completely unbelievable. Kirk Cameron should be ashamed of himself for being in this piece of garbage.

The first two movies are pretty well fdone and true to the books

I bought this for my 3yr old twins, and from the first showing, I kept hearing giggling and laughing as they watched the cartoons. My girls already are familiar with some fairy tales, so they really loved "The Three Little Pigs" and "The Pied Piper". I highly recommend this DVD and think it is a great buy for parents with young children

Four stars seem a little generous. The film is certainly memorable, and certainly different. There are a lot of odd things going on here. The oddest is why the central character, Mark Lewis, is so obviously a blond, blue-eyed German. Very strange, this. Is there some weird subterranean comment about the sickness of Hitler's Germany, and how we ought to feel sorry for the perpetrators of his crimes, because of their blighted childhoods? Much of the rest of the symbolism is very heavy-handed, however, as other reviewers have pointed out. It is consistently perverse. The director of the film within the film: "The Walls are Closing In", is played by an actor who was in point of fact virtually blind. He had a bit part in several James Bond films. Is there some message here? Peeping Tom's father, the heartless psychologist, was played by Powell himself. What is this telling us?  Is part of the message meant to be that the camera kills? It doesn't hang together somehow. What's the meaning of the model with half a hideous face? Why is the would-be girl-friend's alcoholic mother blind? Why is the only presence with real star quality, Moira Shearer, playing a stand-in? Much of the premise of the film seems promising, but it is clumsily written, and directed with a leaden hand. In fact, what many of the Powell-Pressburger films seem to lack is any real sense of pace or excitement. It's all a bit tired, and slow. There is nausea, but no shock or thrill. Loco, perhaps, but Psycho, it isn't.

Edmund O'Brien is a CPA who decides to get away to San Francisco for a weekend to sow some wild oats (and also to get away from his secretary who's nagging him to marry her). There he's poisoned and told he has only a few days to live; he tries to find out who poisoned him and why. The trail takes him into a world of corruption and double dealing. Following this trail is a bit confusing for O'Brien and the audience. But the picture is tightly directed and well acted. A highly regarded film-noir entry, and rightly so. Worth a watch

The Dead Zone is still one of the best shows on tv, and while I agree with some of the other posts, the Stillson story arc was handled, well, strangely.

This movie was probably the best one next to Lucario and the Mystery of Mew and Jirachi Wish Maker. Pokemon Ranger centers around the legendary Pokemon Manaphy and of course Ash and his friends. Some new and amazing characters include Buizel, Jackie the Ranger, Mantyke, and Chatot the annoying but funny Pokemon. The villian is great, the ending is amazing, and the effects were the best yet

Whenever I think of the Second World War, the two places I usually think about in terms of carnage is the Eastern Front; and the war between Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia. The other is the Pacific Campaign between the USA and Japan. One of the reviewers wrote, "I'm glad the Russian Won." So am I. And what a bloody war it was. The number of casualties and amount of destruction make what occurred in the others parts of the globe [except Asia] seem pale in comparison. The Russians suffered greatly at the hands of the Germans, and the German army paid one hell of a steep price.

Also, it was in the east where the Germans committed some of the most horrendous atrocities known to mankind. It was in the east where extermination camps were set up to murder millions of Jews: The German  program of the 'Final Solution.' Everything I have ever read about the  Second World War concerning the eastern front is one of brutality on a scope that is horrifically mind-boggling. It's as if life were cheap and each day may have been the last. This documentary does a very decent job in attempting to address the fighting between these two armies. From Barbarossa to Berlin, it is one of the best documenatries out there. At least for the 200 minutes that the film devotes to the eastern front. I don't believe this is the definitive documentary, as more and more information is being released now that the Soviet Union is no more. But for now, I highly recommend this film. [Stars: 4.5]

OK, this definately looks very promising.  I saw a version of this on the Flix channel about three nights ago.  It was good.  If that is any indication on how good the show is then this Collector's Edition Box Set of the older series should be better.  I am going to purchase this soon.  Once I purchase it, I will let you know how good it really is. I'll give another review once I purchase this boxed set and have an opportunity to view the episodes .

A month ago is when I really learned of this series so I am truly looking forward to watching this series.

This is a great DVD.  I bought it for my son, who has Special Needs.  He attends a lot of dances and is always on the dance floor, but has never been able to figure out how to do the Electric Slide or Macarena.  Neither my husband nor I knew how to do these dances either.  I played the "Party Line Dances" DVD, and asked my son to follow Shawn's instructions.  Pretty soon he was moving along with Shawn, and doing very well.  And by joining a few of our son's practices, my husband and I quickly picked up the dance moves too.  My son now participates fully, and we look forward to line dancing at our own occasions

Hey...this is a great DVD with great packaging--definitely one of the best that I've seen, and there is a lot of extras. Definitely a must-have for He-Man and She-Ra fans! I just got an e-mail stating that the distributor of He-Man will be releasing She-Ra on DVD, starting July 11. That release will be "The Secret of the Sword" and five other episodes deemed most popular by fans. After that, in the fall they will release the complete 93 episodes in three separate volumes within the next 12 months. For anyone who wants to see for themselves, go to tvshowsondvd.com and look at the news for She-Ra. I hope you are as excited as I am

I rented this (sigh) several years ago, liked it or Julia Roberts enough to buy it but didn't open the new copy until the other day and watched it today.  I regretted buying a new copy after all, remembering it only as a few heartwarming (I didn't want my heart warmed) months in the lives of just plain folks in CT.  (Incidentally, the 3 girls are not sisters, just 2 of them.)  I made fun of it, my friend made fun of it, I watched a few minutes then turned it off, then watched some more, finally got up to about 40 minutes and decided to finish it.  It has charm.  It IS a soap opera, but I thought it was well acted and well done.  It had humor, happiness, sadness, embarrassment (like the barrels of fish in the rich kid's car), love.  It had so much plot that it practically had none at all.  And I liked it.  But now, 15 minutes later, I'm beginning all over again to wonder why I bought it.  I could have done without hearing sinatra singing in the background toward the end of the flick.  That man was a nauseous menace and could barely sing at all, no range, no depth, somehow he could carry a tune, but that's about the size of it, speaking of size, the size of his ego (which I assume is why he didn't deign to sing the tunes the way the songwriters wrote them or the lyrics) would have made a mushroom cloud!  I recommend this movie if you like this kind of thing.  For it's kind, I thought it was perfectly done.  I just like them a smidge more sophisticated.  The vulgarity and blasphemies were delicious.

I previously wrote a review for this and only gave it 3 stars. But after watching it again, I realized I liked it better (I do agree with the reviewer below me in that it does grow on you). I do not consider all of the performances goth. Martiya Possesion are more tribal than anything(at least on this video) and I really dislike the expression, or lack thereof, on their faces while they are dancing. They either look completely bored, pissed off, or smug. I skip right over it. 

I also did not care for Asharah's dance to the drum solo by Solace ("Opaque"). The dance mood does not match the mood of the music at all. The music is saying "fast, big, upbeat" and she's standing there doing taxim moves and small quick moves.

And of course, we all love the S&M piece...excuse me, S&M is NOT part of the Goth subculture, and has no place on a bellydance video. Jehan may be a great and accomplished dancer, but she didn't dance much on this and I didn't want to see what WAS on her part.

Another thing I would have liked to see is more GOTH music. I like Solace and all, but there were a lot of songs by them on this video and it would have been nice to see some more pieces done to music from the Goth genre. There were a few, but not enough for my liking.

My favorites on this video were Tempest, Ariellah, Jeniviva and Ayshe (for wierdness factor). For all of its faults, this is a good video to be inspired by and I will use it for that purpose

They do't make musicals like this anymore. Well,they don't really make musicals anymore, do they? They used to make them, made them well and they came out like "Down Argentine Way." The plot is just enough to keep your interest but the music is bright,costumes lavish and not a few laughts. The major players- Betty Grable and Don Ameche- are as engaging as usual.Carmen Miranda makes her US film debut and sings, dances and mispronounces her way to stardom. The 20th Century Fox role players appear (Charlotte Greenwood, J. Carrol Naish, Henry Stephenson)and add to the fun.

Joan Crawford had it. Star quality. When I first saw her in 'Grand Hotel' I was surprised how much I was watching her character instead of the equally riveting character played by the great Greta Garbo. Both were STARS. But Crawford was able to project a different kind of sensuality than Garbo - a vulnerability, a plucky girl-next-door quality.

In Humoresque, an older Crawford was still able to achieve this level of performance paired off with the younger male star. Let's face it - women have a great advantage acting (perhaps women are always acting) - besides being better looking than men, they can emote more without going out of gender role. A distinct advantage vis-a-vis men who must restrict their emotional range or be accused of over acting.

It's a horrible thing to fall in love. And that is just what Crawford's character does. Falls in love with the worst of all possible choices: a musician. Musicians only love music. The music in the film is worth the price of admission alone. Who amongst you would throw the first stone at a fine violinist playing 'Zigeunerwisser' or any of the other fine war horses of the classical violin repertoire?

She falls in love with the young 'artist of the month' whom she offers to help jumpstart his career, renting a concert hall for his first recital. She is married to a wealthy but understanding man who loves her but lets her do what she wants - drinking, philandering ... Most men do what she wants and accept her ridicule. The character of the musician does not; he's a tough New Yorker who gives her as good as he gets - and she finds herself loving him despite herself.

Love is madness, and when he starts being successful with his concert tours but neglects to phone her for weeks, she falls apart emotionally. It is profoundly humiliating to realize someone else can hurt you badly simply by declining to keep in touch. Silence is the perfect expression of contempt, isn't it? She drinks, she mopes about her 'cottage' in the Hamptons, she is crazy in love with a man who doesn't seem to reciprocate her feelings. 

In our time, she might see her doc and get a prescription for Zoloft to be rid of the lovesick blues and of obsessive thoughts of him. But this is before Thorazine, even, and she's just out of luck there. So she drinks. Drinking was the preferred way to deaden the unbearable pain of rejection in love in the days before designer drugs were available from your neighborhood spice man. 

To complicate things, her musician had an old girlfriend from the conservatory where he studied music as a young man. Additionally, there was the dreaded 'american mom' in full armor. She just had to tell this grown son of hers, repeatedly, that the woman he finally fell in love with was no good. She even slaps him upside the head as he shows her around his ritzy new apartment with a view; it seems he has too many portraits of Crawford's character in view. That's the way, Mom. Make your boy marry a good girl, like you, maybe.

Meanwhile, and I just love a line the character played by Oscar Levant comes up with at her cottage in the Hamptons, "You're not the kind of woman who lets her husband get in the way of her marriage." A lot funnier said than written. Levant did a lot of great piano playing in the film, dropping dozens of one liners like that. He almost stole several acts. This is a very forties film. In black and white. Whatever happened to the colorization process? Oh, well.

Finally, Mom tells the rich girl to keep her hands off her son. And dutifully, Crawford's character retreats to her cottage in the Hamptons, gets drunk one last time, wades into the surf in a stunning, shimmering black cocktail dress and is never seen again. I told you love was dangerous! 

Her lover, after cancelling one measly concert out of despair at her death, decides not to ruin a promising career and returns to the concert stage. Men! Emotional IQs of 30, at most. Well, that's all folks. If your eyes were still dry at the end of this film, you're safe - you'll never fall in love

"American Gigolo" stars Richard Gere of a high priced male prostitute.  He is coasting along with his rich southern Cailifonia clients until one of them is murdered.  When he is considered the main suspect, he goes on the run, with his only friend being the wife of a politician.  At the begining he tells people that he is a moral man,  for example, he dosn't service gays, more on that in a moment.  It is interseting to note that Gere also played in a movie about hookers a decade later in "Pretty Woman" and it made a star out of Julia Roberts.  But that is where the similarities end.  This is a much darker story about hypocracy.  When he falls under suspicion all his clients that liked him before all distance themselves from him.  In the end, he finds himself a hypocrit, because in order to get an aliby he is willing to do anything job; gays, S and M, anything to avoid jail.  The only love story here is about him and the politician's wife (Lauren Hutten).  It is complicated by the fact that he will not let anyone in close to him, even for his own protection.  For all it's darkness there is one funny scene.  Richard Gere is called in for a line up at the police department.  He tells the other men in the line up that he got paid, and the others get angry and cause a scene, averting the attention off of Gere.  This is a really good movie as an examination of society's attitude toward sex.  This film was written and directed by Paul Schrader, if that is why it seems like a less brutal companion to "Taxi Driver".  Richard Gere is wooden, but his character is cold and icy, so that approach is right.  Lauren Hutten is alright as the bored housewife of a powerful man; she seems sincere in wanting to help Gere.  But I thought the standout performance was Bill Duke as the slezzy street pimp who is quiet but menacing (as oppose to Gere's 'Madam'), but also provides the warning to Gere at the beginning that his 15 minutes of fame are running out.  And another future "Pretty Woman" player is present; Hector Elanzo.   He plays the detective on Gere's trail; but he is slimy and rather unlikable here.  Well worth your time, but for adults only

I will make this short.  Aykroyd, Candy two men who are hilarious together is of course hilarious.  The story is about a man who loves his family and is a middle class man going on vaction.  His relatives decide to join him without letting him know.  The relatives are totally diffren't from the family they join and seeing them mingle is a riot.  I say get this movie because everyone I know who has seen it all say the same thing  "I love that movie, it is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.

This was part of the Marvel Action Hour along with Iron Man. At first, the animation and dialogue was pretty bad and they had annoying supporting characters, but the series remain true to the comics. The story lines they took from the comics were done very well, like episodes involving the Silver Surfer

This film harks back to a time when africentricity was woven into the psyche of the younger generation.  Blackness informed all of their life decisions and defined their aesthetic. This is definitely true of the younger generation in this film. Another dynamic at play in this film is a sort of intergenerational upheaval. Some members of the older generation were reconsidering their long held beleifs on what it meant to be Black in America while the rest of the older generation stood firm staunchly defending their fossilized ideals. So if you're in the mood to see a comedic family film with a post sixties revolutionary air view "Five On the Black Hand Side" and breathe in the culture

DMX stars as the drug dealer King David, who pops up in the streets again after a long absence. Rolling into the frame in a player's classic - a late 70's Stutz Blackhawk - King David shrugs his way back into the hard-knock life. He quickly reaps what he sows and, mortally wounded, passes all his worldly goods to Paul (David Arquette), a scrambling white would-be writer. King David's estate includes an audio journal of his life, which provides flashbacks and a narrative-within-a-narrative that answers the shaken Paul's curiosity. It's the highlights of King David's high life that propel "Alone." 

Like all of Goines's heroes, King David is a scourge on the periphery, and the movie dramatizes his corrosive effect on the margins with savvy muscularity. Every life he touches he leaves in ruins - a need to deface beauty as a result of self-loathing is implicit, and DMX signals that motivation with sly hostility. 

To say that King David is the best part he's ever had is an understatement; he has never felt the need to inhabit a movie in this way before.

I would recomed this to anyone who likes the hip hop lifestyle or music and for anyone who like films with a twist

The best edition so far,however...
The color is smeared and skewed just enough to bother me. But what do you want for 10 bucks? I saw Gorgo a bunch of times in first run, and I remember seeing the actual Gorgo creature on it's trailer being driven up Woodward ave in Detroit on it's way to the Fox theater. A great promo. The eyes are the thing I remember most as Gorgo rises from the sea, those red glowing eyes were just beautiful and so expressive. The color smearing just manages to obscure those eyes. But still this print is the best I've seen. If I live long enough, I hope they issue a perfect HD version of this movie. I would pay 3 times the price of this edition to get my clutches on that. But this is worth the cost. A must for any serious collector

I just watched "Mommie Dearest" for the first time tonight. As most critics and fans of "Mommie Dearest" acknowledge, the film portrays such a pitiful story of abuse, with such an over-dramatic (but entirely true-to-life) performance by Faye Dunaway, it was both hilarious and depressing.  I'm 30 and didn't know much about Joan Crawford outside of the endless chatter about the film being "classic camp."  Seems to me Crawford was probably bi-polar or had some other unexplained mental disorder.  I think she was quite aware that some of the insanity she lived with was caused by movie industry she was dedicated to. She knew the industry poisoned any good thing she endeavored to do, whether it was having a successful marriage, a happy family, or even giving to charity. Her life was a running commercial directed by Hollywood, not unlike the tabloid-driven, image-obsessed Hollywood we have today. Despite the often-times hilarious image of her and her sibling's victimization on film, Christina's abuse and disappointment with her mother was real and painful at some point in her life. Christina Crawford was completely justified turning her mother's image on its head with her book and movie. Yes, the movie is outrageous but it is also empowering. After all, what can the powerless do about their pitiful past except laugh. Mocking the unexplained, unjustified pain you experienced in the past, renders it powerless to harm your future. This is the legacy of "Mommie Dearest" whatever Joan Crawford really was

I don't own a copy of the original cut, and it's been a while since I've seen the original cut.

A short review of THIS version is as follows. 

The film print is FLAWLESS in the sense it looks like it was shot in the 70's or 80's on purpose. The blue filter is gone, so it doesn't look slick and shiny. This film is dark, rich, and grungy. Very "noir-ish", and warm.

Obviously the running gag through out the first film was that Porter wants his 70k back... not 130k or 1 million, just 70k. This was maybe mentioned 3 or 4 times and that was it. The first cut seemed like it was being used more for comedy relief over and over and over again.

Porter in this film is not charming or smooth. He's smart, violent, and cold. A true anti-hero. The annoying voice over narration is gone. There are several new characters, and several new brutal kills. 

Minus the credits, this film comes in at a brisk 1 hr and 25 minutes. 

This is a great companion piece to the great "To Live and Die in L.A." It got the same mood.


I told you this review was going to be short.

Based on a true story and a book called EVIDENCE OF LOVE, this tv movie is made remarkable by the Emmy-winning performance of Barbara Hershey.  She is utterly magnificent in the role of a middle class housewife who brutally murders her ex-lover's wife in a self defensive rage.  Hershey superbly captures the many nuances of this seemingly normal woman who commits a heinous deed.  Her hypnosis sequence is brutally painful and she pulls out no stops in showing us the hidden rage.
Brian Dennehy is equally good as the lawyer who tries to get her out of her terrifying predicament.
The movie is impressively done and once again worthy most of all for Ms. Hershey's dynamic presence

This disc is pure gold! Featuring a FULL live performance from their 2004 European tour and tons of classic and backstage footage this is the ultimate Stray Cats fan collectible! The concert documented on this disc is so satisfying you would think it was still the early 80's. They show almost no signs of age and you can tell they pour their heart out into the show. They go through all their classics and then some. Whether it's "Stray Cat Strut" "Gene And Eddie" or "Rumble In Brighton" what you see and hear on this disc is flawless. Must buy for ALL music fans, not just fans of the Cats

I have read many reviews stating that this remake is inferior to the orginal version of 1968. Granted, that version is marvelous. 

I have bought both versions and love them both. OK, it is difficult not to compare when watching. 

BUT I can't help wondering: if this version would have been the first I or anybody watched instead of the 1968 version, if people would have been complaining about that version?

I can have different versions of Vivaldi's four seasons can't I? Actually for those among us who love classical music and opera it is quite common to have several versions of the same musical piece and enjoy them all (and I do understand that people can have preferences for one or the other). We would never say this or that piece is a remake of that version, would we? I have gone to the opera numerous times and watched Don Giovanni three times. Every time with different performers. Remake? Absolutely not.

I think that the only reason one would have made this version of lion in winter is the wish to make it, because is such a great play. So, logically this would not be a remake!

Why can't we watch this version for what it is and let go of the other (splendid 1968) version when doing so? 

That done, I must say I understand why Alais is in love with king Henry. Patrick Stewart is a very fine actor and has magnificent voice which he uses  very well. He is a  very good match to Close's queen. I did not care for Richard, I thought he was not commanding enough, bit whiny. I think John is a difficult part to play to say the least and I didn't care for him either, too much the idiot. Geoffrey on the other hand is really conniving and very good. King Philippe: too much a boy, although he has moments when the interaction with king Henry makes him interesting. Alais:good enough. 

Which of the versions do I prefer? that is difficult. I have highly enjoyed both. I think the 1968 version has a sharper edge because of Hepburn and I prefer her to Close. This version has a more emotional and sometimes romantic (Alais and Henry) approach. 

I definitely prefer Stewart to O'Toole, who seemed too young for the role. I liked the way Stewart made us see Henry's  self confindence in his plans and his pleasure in manipulating and scheming (that is, until the end, when things turn out the wrong way and you see hem falling apart). O'Toole had a very serious approach all the time.

On the other hand: Anthony Hopkins and Timothy Dalton were both splendid. I think overall that the 1968 version has a better supporting cast. 

Which of the versions I watch, depends on the mood I am in. I think they are both good in their own way.

This is an excellent film. A lot of the topics that were discussed in this film still happen at HBCU's!!!! As a matter of fact, the issue of lightskinned vs. darkskinned is still going on today, on a college campus or not. Spike Lee to me is one of the best film directors of all time. He is not afraid to tackle issues that are in the African American community. I highly recommend this film. If you haven't seen it, get the DVD. It's a classic

I would recommend this Mel Brooks movie if you're in the mood to see slapstick comedy with many popular comedic faces.  You'll come away repeating some of the catch phrases and dialog.  I first saw it when it came out and still laugh when I see it.  Mel Brooks is a genius

I thought this movie was great!  It's definitely for the more cultured and intillectual movie-goer.  It's probably the best dark comedy I've ever seen (only to rival the masterpiece that is &quot;Heathers&quot;).  The dialog in this movie with leave you with one-liners for years to come.  After seeing &quot;Party Girl&quot; I fell in love with Parker Posey, and when I saw this I loved her even more. This instantly became one of my favorite movies of all time, but then again I'm a huge fan of good dark comedies and I have a sick sense of humor. Everyone I know absolutely loved this move (including my MOM!) In any event, this is a definite must-see for any fan of Parker Posey and dark comedy.  Excellent

Of course Dead Alive was the better movie.  But I think the comparisons to the Peter Jackson masterpiece are appropriate, due to the fact that there is a high body count, lots of over-the-top splattery deaths, and annoying partygoers that end up as zombie killers, some as zombie lunch.  Apparently there was some footage  cut out for this release.  I'm not sure if that was gore footage or not, but I would think gorehounds would like this one due to the overwhelming amount of onscreen violence.  There is even some non-gore &quot;grossout&quot; humor (vomit-related, etc.) that reminded me of Bad Taste as well as Dead Alive.  Sorry to run the Peter Jackson comparison into the ground, but again the influence is unquestionable.  Don't expect the FX quality of Dead Alive though, this looked lower budget and some scenes were a little too dark to make out everything clearly.  I don't know if this was the way the original film was shot or if it was the print/transfer, but it's a minor distraction.  They did a great job with a relatively small budget.  I echo the other reviewers who would like to see Ittenbach's other films on US (hopefully uncut) DVD release--I've heard Burning Moon is especially crazy

SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION is an outstanding play transformed to the screen with dignity but with a script that keeps us in the live theatre instead of in a motion picture.  Not that that is a bad thing: the script by John Guare is brilliant.  It simply seems a little static, with its marvelous plays on words, repeated phrases, and disjointed movements significant unto themselves but not really taking advantage of cinematic possibilities of flow.

Essentially the tale of how a married couple who deal art (Stockard Channing and Donald Sutherland - both in peak form) are so caught up in their superficial lives that they are taken in by a handsome young African American con artist (Will Smith) whose various antics bring the couple round to reexamining their shallow existence.  Most of the story is related over art dealings and dinner conversations and are peopled by such luminaries as Kitty Carlisle, Ian McKellen, artists Chuck Close and Kazuko, Mary Beth Hurt, Bruce Davidson etc - a really fine ensemble.  There are many social comments clustered in this story and it continues to play well after its origins on the stage and fifteen years after the movie was made.  This was one of Will Smith's entries into film as well as one of the gifted Stockard Channing's finest roles.  Highly recommended for repeated viewings. Grady Harp, October 0

I remember way back in '80 when this movie was the buzz of Hollywood. That is, the buzz on Johnny Carson.  The media killed this movie before anybody had the chance to judge it for itself.

Yet, in the mid 80's, it came out on both Betamax and VHS, and naturally I bought me a Beta copy to judge for myself what kind of a movie it was.

First, it is not a drive in movie or one made for mass consumption.  It is long and intraclly woven together.  it is lavish and sometimes loud.  It is a brutal slap in the face to "Manifest Destiny" and a cruel dig to the sickos that even today claim that this is "God's" country.  As if their 'God" gave them wealth and privilige and that this God justifies revolution, massacre and war.

Many comparisons can be mase with the America of the late 19th century and the America ruled presently by King George W. and his robber barons of Capitalism.  But it is now, as then, much more conveniant to steer the "common man" into their churches, into their army,  into their lies.  The enemy is those "illegal aliens" those in the "gay agenda," those who dare to investigate or challenge the status quo.  Kris Kristofferson plays a mayor/sherriff if wealth and means who (shock-shock) sides with the common man and the undertrodden.  When another of his "breeding and class" challenges him on why he stands up for the underdogs and not his own class, he replies to the creep:  "You are not of my class, to be of my class you first have to die and be born again!"

This is a revolutionary movie, meant to be savored, each and every minute of it.  This movie dares you to look at  things usually not into history books or shown on the History Channel

if you love dancehall this movie has a bit of a surprise for you. ninjaman, elephantman, nitty kutchie, boom dandemite, harry toddler, and cutty ranks all have roles in this movie; which is a cop versus gun dealer type flick. the dvd is full screen and shot in cheap video format, but it still shines despite these flaws. the soundtrack is very good despite containing no tracks from the aforementioned artists. i wonder if this is what ninjaman has been doing lately, because he does have quite a substantial role in this flick, and doesn't do bad at all at the acting thing...

I'm very very picky about my action movies and this one is worth the trouble.  Story line shmory line, this is an ACTION movie.  I watch my action movies for action not a lesson in philosophy and religion.  Kind of a heartbreaking movie, though, because he's dead no matter what.  The man can't sleep or he slips in a coma.  Going out with a bang with a freefall from a helicopter telling his woman how much he loved her... that's a film.  You won't regret owning this, I promise you.

p.s.  It is very possible that the negative reviewers are crackbabies.  That is all

In this movie based on a true story we see Jerry Stahl played by Ben Stiller. Jerry is a geek Hollywood scriptwriter who turns out junk for sitcoms although he thinks he is Shakespeare by his admiration of his own writing. Jerry has it all- a Hollywood mansion, Liz Hurley, a cool car and yet he decides to throw it all away for some Heroin. Jerry's Heroin habit costs $6,000 a week but he is only earning $5000(!!!) per week. One does not need a Phd. in Advanced Mathematics to realize this this spells TROUBLE. Jerry eventually gets clean with the help of Maria Bello and then he wrote his story in a best selling book. One can only hope that his new fortune does not lure him back into the Drug Scene. I give this sorry excuse of a movie 5 stars because it has Maria Bello in it although I still can't figure out why she finds Jerry The Geek so interesting. His story is the same as any Street Junkie.They all look the same to me when they are injecting Heroin into their veins on the street

This is the third DVD from Shawn Trautman that I have gotten (Swing and Cha-Cha are the others), and they are all exceedingly well done.  They start from ground zero and progress in very small steps that are a snap to follow.  By the time it's over, you will understand the logic behind the dance and know enough to do well on a social dance floor.  It will also get you pumped to learned more advanced steps; you won't feel intimidated.  I highly recommend it

Burt Lancaster stars in this tough, grim noir-drenched prison flick, in which a sadistic prison guard (a young Hume Cronyn) manipulates tensions and weaknesses to produce an explosive situation.  The film's liberal message butts up against its obligatory &quot;crime never pays&quot; ending; the convicts are sympathetic, but doomed from the word &quot;go.&quot;  A little stagey and lurid, but overall tense and suspenseful -- the ending is a real nail-biter.

I stumbled across this movie on cable a couple of years ago, having nothing better to do I watched it. My first impression was that it would be just another stoner movie were nothing really happens. I was suprised though because not only does it have a plot it has a interesting plot. You don't have to be stoned, or even a stoner to enjoy this movie. One reveiwer said somthing along the lines of it looking like grade school kids made it. Well it is true it was an independent film made on the cheep but think it actualy adds something to the over all feel of the film, like your actualy there, scrapping through life with the characters. I guess I can understand why some people wouldnt get this movie, not enough bells and whisels, but if your up for something differnt give it a try. by the way, the movie was based on a book of the same name, also very good and differnt

If you're looking to hear Robert Johnson's songs, you should probably buy one of the awesome collections availible.  As this legend and musical genius has now been dead for 65 years, I'm not sure what the other reviewers were looking for besides other people covering his songs, and talk about his life... that's all we have now.  And of course the covers do not outdo him; that would be impossible.  But there is some very thoughtful discussion on the life of Robert Johnson and the world he lived in.  The discussion with a former classmate is touching, and the covers of his songs by those who knew him (Robert Lockwood Jr., Honeyboy Edwards)and by some of the new delta-blues talent such as Guy Davis, Roy Rogers and especially Alvin Youngblood Heart blew me away.  Gov't Mule and Sonny Landreth do some awesome electric renditions of his work.  The major let downs are the cuts into interviews and pointless displays of the rock n' roll hall of fame gathering, and also Bob Weir's performance, which is just plain bad.  All in all, it is a good film, and it's nice to actually be able to watch people play his music, as we will never be able to see the real thing

I had heard about this flick being talked about as the Chinese Charlie's Angels.  It took me a while but I finally popped it in.  WOW, this has to be on of the coolest movies  I have seen in a while.  I was expecting a chick flick but maybe that is why I liked it so much.  

The story is about these 2 women who have kind of a stupid backround story but what they do now is assasinate people for a living.  Sweet!  I am not going to lie, I wasn't paying attention to the story what so ever the first time i saw this because of how hot these women are.  Add in a super hot cop who wants to take them down, and you have yourself one of the funnest movie ever.  All of these girls know martial arts, or at least they can put their legs up really high and director Corey Yuen puts in some of the best wirework I have seen.  This movie certainly isn't going to win any awards for it's high amount of cheese injected in the plot but it is a movie that I wish I could fill my room with about 100 diffrerent screen shot posters.  

So on top of this being an amazingly fun movie, Yasuaki Kurata shows up for the finale!!!!!!!  Corey Yuen goes all out with this one and puts together truly one of the best screen battles of all time that will rival any old school kung fu movie.  If you have seen some of Coery's 80's stuff like Yes Madam or even the newer Fong Sai Yuk then get ready to be taken back some years when Corey did some of the best action sequences in the history of cinema(Example:Ninja in the Dragon's Den).  Kurata plays a great character in my favorite movie ever, Legend of a Fighter which was made in 1981.  Well at 56 years old he looks just as good!!!!  I was so amazed by this movie I have watched it 3 nights in a row and I will continue this routine for a while:)

The picture quality on the Columbia Tristar version is perfect and has pretty well written subtitles.  Also good 5.1 sound, cantonese track, the original mandarin track, and a horrible English dub.

I've seen it about 20 times now.  It doesn't get old.  The faces, the moves and the lines of Matthew Perry are always fresh.  My husband likes Selma, a lot, so it's a win win for both of us.  They are great together.
Good stuff

I remember putting Season 9 as the worst season of Friends in my book, but it's not as bad as I remembered. Some episodes are actually incredibly funny. The faux pas was when they started to have Aisha Tyler guess star as Charlie, and have her come between Joey and Ross. Also, the whole story line with Rachel's infatuation for Joey could've been better executed, or shouldn't have been there at all. It got bad towards the end, but I'm not disappointed. The stuff leadings towards it was classic Friends

Style : Salsa exercise
Level : Very fit

This is now the best latin exercise dvd on the market. It is a Salsa style exercise dvd. It contains pure NY shines with some salsa rhythm inspired dance steps. It is a much better routine than her first dvd which was geared towards the beginner market. This dvd is made more for the serious Salsa dancer who is already fit.

For people looking for a salsa shine video this would be a great start.

I must point out you would have to be fit to do this dvd. It is very fast paced.

Buy Lisa's first dvd to prepare yourself for this dvd

It is almost ashame that North Amercian culture needs Bill Maher.

After all, shouldn't honest yet entertaining social commentary be a little bit more available then it currently is? On Victory Begins At Home, Maher creates entertainment by basically speaking his mind.

Maher's central premise that the War On Terrorism can be aided by what people do in the United States really is almost a common sense arguement. Yet Maher is so uniquely unapologetic about what he says and how he presents it, the commentary and comedy bristle with an energy that few comedians can match. 

Maher does this by not pretending he isn't politically opinated, in fact that is what bases his comedy completely on, the rarity of straight-forward unabashed opinion.

On Victory Begins At Home he is more Democrat then Republican, but he openly sides with neither. Instead, he rails at all presenting himself as a full person, neither liberal nor conservative, right-wing or left-wing.

The end result is an engaging and unique look at culture that seems unfiltered. There is no spin here, what Maher realizes is that no spin is funny in a world full of it. With all the spin that is normally doled out by the news media, political columnists and special interest groups, know wonder we need him so much.

This series is exactly what the English love about mystery and crime.  It's a tad bit dull compared to what we are used to with cop shows and series like "The Shield".  That being said, this series is well done and does capture you over time.  Rather than individual crime stories, this series contains only one crime investigation.  If you like drama and cop stories, this is a good one

I think "Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown" was fine. The only sad things were when Charlie Brown didn't get any valentines until a day later, and when Linus missed giving valentine treats to his teacher. I would have felt the same way as Violet when Charlie Brown wasn't getting valentines. I would say Charlie Brown should have gotten as many valentines as the others. Everybody is too mean to him!

"A Charlie Brown Valentine" was swell because it wasn't as sad. On this one, Charlie Brown seems to go after the little red haired girl through most of it. He wanted to dance with her, but couldn't. What sounded odd to me was that Peppermint Patty sent him a valentine this time. It would only sound like her if she really loved Charlie Brown

As I went through music school in the eary fifties I was confronted with "Lenny". Now at 72 I still have this pleasure. There are people in the NYP that are legendary as are the performances. This set will give me a huge amount of pleasure for what ever time I have left. It is a wonderful historical document but most of all a tribute-legacy that people will be wondering about many years in the future. Bob Allshouse from the Dana school of Music 1952-57

These are excellent performances for a very reasonable price.  The look of some of the videos as well as some of the film stock is "dated" but the performances easily shine through.  Not quite as well played, recorded or filmed as Bernstein's many later Unitel films but still well worth the investment.   I won't spend time on details but rest assured it's all great stuff!

This was the first DVD I purchased after I bought my DVD player (I know, it took me a while to get one). I had never seen the movie before, but amazon[.com] reccomended it so I took the chance. It had the perfect amount of predictability and comedie and romance. It's the same story line that gets used a million times and never grows old. Boy and girl are best friends. Girl likes boy, but boy likes a different girl. Boy asks for help from girl to get the other girl. Boy realizes he's in love with friend girl just in time to stop her from leaving

WOW! This was a pretty decent romantic comedy. We had this in our collection for months (Possibly years) and never watched it. We decided to watch this film on a whim. I have to say that it was better and ever funnier than I thought it would be.

Monica Potter is great in her role. It's a sweet movie that actually doesn't do to much guy bashing (the reason so many guys hate romantic comedies). I am also a big fam of Henry Thomas, and he is great at as well.

I won't go into the plot here, as many others already have. But what I am simply amazed with as many bad romantic comedies that get released in theatres (Sweet Home Alabama & 13 Going on 30) that a movie like this never got mainstream attention. 

The other thing that must be said is, with virtually no cute romatic female leads under 40 (and over 18), why isn't Monica Potter more famous than she is. She can easily be the next Julia Roberts, or Meg Ryan. Julia has 2 kids and Meg has just hit the wall, it's time for a beauty like Monica Potter to get into the very lucrative Romantic Comedy genre. Here's hoping she gets a better agent before it's to late.

Cute movie, with a good heart. Definetly made a date night at home wonderful.

(for the record 32yrs old, straight and yes I enjoyed this movie)

Made in 1959, Douglas Sirk's Imitation of Life is still just as evocative and as gorgeous to look today as it was almost 50 years ago. It's a real cinematic treat, shameless tearjerker, and an unabashed melodrama that dares to confront head-on issues of racism and the problems of motherhood at the stage when one's teenagers - in this case daughters--are growing up and preparing to enter the world.

Lana Turner has never looked more ravishing as Lora Meredith, a young New York widow who will do anything to realize her dreams of Broadway stardom. Together with her young daughter Susie, they live in a squalid apartment eking out a hand-to-mouth existence, their futures fuelled by unfulfilled dreams. 

One day at Coney Island, Lora and Susie meet another a white girl Sarah Jane, who is being taken care of by a black woman, Annie Johnson (Juanita Moore), whom Lora mistakes for the maid.  When told by her that she's the mother, the surprised Lora falters but then accepts it without a question as if it were a natural thing that a black woman has a white child. 

The angelic and virtuous Annie asks Lora if she can come and help out around the apartment. Lora is initially hesitant - not because of Annie's race but because she's struggling and doesn't have any money to pay her a wage. Eventually, however, she relents and tells Annie that her and her daughter can stay for one night. 

At the same time, Lora meets the extremely fine-looking wannabe photographer, Steve Archer (John Gavin). Steve takes an instant liking to Lora and offers to marry her. But Lora is far too concerned with realizing her acting dreams to be stifled by a man and by marriage. Meanwhile, the saintly Annie is troubled that her daughter is ashamed of being black and tries to pass herself off in school as white.

Imitation of Life follows these characters throughout their lives, with Sirk piling on the sentiment and melodrama every chance he can get.  Lora does indeed become a famous Broadway actress, yet neglects her growing daughter in the process. Steve goes on to become a president of a large photographic organization, but has trouble relating to Lora's need to be independent and famous. 

Annie's heart is eventually broken, gradually worn down by years of emotional abuse from her daughter. Sara Jane is so angry at being labeled as black that she repudiates her mother and ultimately runs away. Annie always stays the subservient and loyal maid; whilst her best friend and employer goes on to bask in a lush and international success. The contrast of the mother's compensations from their conflicting daughters is the story's ultimate paradox.

Lora, Annie, Steve and the two girls seem to be victims of each other. They all want to follow their own dreams and forge their own paths in life even when it doesn't seem to be doing them much good. They are also surprisingly oblivious of how manipulated they are by the world around them. 

Lora gets her career but she's unlucky in love and terminally insecure as a mother, Whilst Sara Jane - perhaps the most damaged character - achieves her ambition to pass herself off as a white girl, but at great personal cost to both her and her aging mother. 

Under Douglas Sirk's accomplished direction, Miss Turner et al acts ornately and elaborately, everything is over emphasized to within an inch of its life, especially Lana's gorgeous outfits, yet the film - clocking in at over two hours - is always compelling and is never boring. 

The screenplay is sophisticated, the themes are brave and tempting and the look of the film - the brilliant surfaces, audacious colors, and the spatial complexities of 50s moderne architecture - bring to the forefront a bittersweet world of fantasy, entrapment, and emotional anxiety, and where the price of following one's dreams eventually comes at a harsh and desultory cost. Mike Leonard June 06.

In 1987 and 1988, JIM HENSON'S THE STORYTELLER aired and became an instant showpiece for television, a truimphant (but short-lived) series breathing fresh life into nine lesser-known northern European fairy tales and, later, into four timeless stories drawn from Greek mythology. These old folk and fairy tales, mined from countries such as Germany and Russia and compiled in 2 discs here, along with the Greek tales, are vigorously and appealingly narrated by two storytellers: John Hurt for the European fables and Michael Gambon for the Greek re-tellings. But, with much respect to Mr. Gambon, who himself does a fine job, it is John Hurt who decidedly draws my attention. Hurt, with the more eye-catching portrayal, is ideal as he inhabits his storytelling character with a gleeful and quirky charm and a mischievous twinkle in his eyes. 

It doesn't hurt that the stories featuring Hurt as the host boast clever and sensitive screenplays written by Anthony Minghella, who, nearly a decade later, would win an Oscar for directing THE ENGLISH PATIENT. As such, JIM HENSON'S THE STORYTELLER gloriously lives up to its titular billing. John Hurt's performance sparkles with his enchanting delivery as, propelled by his captivating voice and effectively off-kilter mannerisms and abetted by heavy make-up, he evokes a rich verbal miasma which sucks the listener in to his stories. Minghella's screenplays are replete with rich, witty wordplay and evocative descriptives that indeed recall to mind the classic fairy tales with which we grew up. The kids, of course, won't have that frame of reference, but, still, watching these episodes, it really does feel as if you're sitting around the fire, enraptured at the feet of a master spinner of yarns. 

Michael Gambon, on the other hand, is burdened with the weightier and grimmer Greek tales. Thus, he eschews John Hurt's light, ebullient touch, opting instead to display a more proper and somber persona. He's pretty good, mind you, but, in the final analysis, he ends up lacking a bit of something when compared to John Hurt. Both Hurt and Gambon, by the way, are accompanied by the same mangy talking dog (as operated by Brian Henson). 

At a half hour per episode, JIM HENSON'S THE STORYTELLER is presented in a marriage of live acting, creative animatronics, and surreal and stylishly vivid imagery. Jim Henson and his crew do a marvelous job with the production values, coming up with excellent special effects (for its time), seamless puppetry, matte paintings, and yeoman make-up work, all to plant the viewer firmly in their fantasy setting. A charming quirk of the series, which adds a nice touch, is the interesting ways the folk tale would continue to make its presence felt during the occasional interludes with the Storyteller and his dog. The camera would cut away from the story and focus on our host by the fireplace, but, somewhere in the background, whether it's on a painting in the back or on the surface of a display jar or cup, images depicting the story are set in motion. Pretty neat. 

The stories themselves are more mature and darker in essence than any kid's fable we're used to over here, especially the Greek entries, and several carry melancholy and bittersweet overtones ("The Soldier and Death," "The Heartless Giant"). But don't keep the kids from watching this series; everyone should get a chance to fall under the spell and feel the power of stories. 

It does help that most of these tales are little known in the States, thereby giving the viewer a chance to enjoy the unfolding of a fresh story and be actually startled here and there. When was the last time CINDERELLA or BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, timeless as they are, offer up anything new? This is just about as perfect as television shows can get; the only flaw I can come up with lies in the dvd set as it comes with no special features whatsoever. ALL the episodes are superb, but if I had to pick the best of the pack, I would definitely go with "Hans My Hedgehog," "The Soldier and Death" and "The Three Ravens." With several recognizable name actors lending their talents to this series, JIM HENSON'S THE STORYTELLER: THE DEFINITIVE COLLECTION truly is a MUST HAVE dvd set.

**************************************************************************

SPOILERS follow. The nine European fables:

"Hans My Hedgehog" - From an early German folk tale: A barren peasant woman, desperately craving a child, naively says aloud that if she had a baby, she wouldn't care what it looks like. Soon enough, she gives birth to a baby who resembles a hedgehog, much to the father's dismay and the scorn of the villagers. 

"Fearnot" - From an early German folk tale: A carefree, absent-minded boy who never scares goes on a strange journey to learn fear. Though still very good, this may be the weakest episode of the lot. Gabrielle Anwar has a tiny nonspeaking role.

"A Story Short" - From an early Celtic folk tale: The Storyteller himself is in the spotlight as he narrates the time he was caught making a fool of the royal cook and, as punishment meted out by the king, must tell one story a day for a year. All goes well until the very last day when the Storyteller suffers from storyteller's block. Brenda Blethyn has a part.

"The Luck Child" - From an early Russian folk tale: Seeking to avert a prophecy which foretells of a seventh son of a seventh son of someday supplanting the current king, the unscrupulous monarch seeks out this luck child and attempts to do away with him. But those blessed with luck cannot be undone...and the same could be said for prophecies. 

The Soldier & Death" - From an early Russian folk tale, this is an awesome story. Because of kind acts towards three beggars, an honest soldier returning from war is given a magical sack, a deck of cards, and a nice whistle, which he uses to save a kingdom and to foil Death.

"The True Bride" - From an early German folk tale. Shades of Aslan! A white lion comes to the aid of a girl (Jane Horrocks, LITTLE VOICE) being held under the cruel care of a troll. Co-starring Sean Bean.

"The Three Ravens" - From an early German folk tale: A wicked witch (Miranda Richardson) weds a widowed king (Jonathan Pryce) and then, recognizing that the king's three sons and daughter pose a threat to her ambition, transforms the three sons into ravens. But the princess (Joely Richardson) escapes and is told by her brothers that, unless she remains speechless for three years, three months, and three days, they'll be trapped in their raven forms forever.

"Sapsorrow" - From an early German folk tale: This is a variant on Cinderella (or is it the other way around?) as a beautiful princess (the unimpressive Alison Doody), seeking to escape an arranged marriage, flees to a distant kingdom and disguises herself as a loathsome hag. But, then, she falls in love with the prince...Co-starring Jennifer Saunders.

"The Heartless Giant" - From an early German folk tale: On the whole, giants are benign creatures, harmless to none, unless, of course, the giant hasn't a heart. This story is about a curious prince who is fooled into freeing one such heartless giant from the king's dungeon...

The Greek myths: 

"Daedalus and Icarus" - The inventor Daedalus and his son Icarus flee from the wicked King Minos with the aid of Daedalus's man-made wings, but will Icarus heed his father's advice? I'm guessing, not.

"Orpheus and Eurydice" - The musician Orpheus descends to Hades to bring back his dead wife.

"Perseus and the Gorgon" - The hero Perseus faces the Gorgon, Medusa.

"Theseus and the Minotaur" - It's Theseus, with some help from a beautiful princess, versus the savage Minotaur, half-man, half-bull.

"The Talons of Weng Chiang" is a wonderfully creepy pseudo-historical tale full of mood, atmosphere, and an unusual amount of violence for "Doctor Who"--almost as if departing producer Philip Hinchcliffe was taking a parting shot at his critics on his way out. But it's not all gloom and doom. This storyline is a fine mix indeed of good old "Doctor Who" humor at its funniest as well as thrilling "Doctor Who" adventure at its most gruesome. The dank and dour city streets and slums of late-19th century London make a grim backdrop for a tale of manipulation, madness, and serial murder (technologically refined cannibalism, really), and yet the Doctor's many clever quips and Leela's naively astute observations on "civilized" Victorian life keeps the viewer laughing throughout, and the main villain's second-hand man, Li-Hsen Chang, has some incredibly witty one-liners as well.

Li-Hsen Chang himself is a fascinating character, delightfully entertaining on stage and yet cold and ruthless in his service to "Weng-Chiang," a stranded, time-traveling dictator from the future who has deceived Chang into believing he's a deity from the Taoist pantheon. Chang's paranormal powers, foremost of which is hypnotism, definitely evoke the late Victorian fascination with mesmerism (see the poster advertising his show) and serve to mark him as a clever echo of the evil Fu Manchu characters so much the stock villains of pulp fiction, and yet he's also a tragic figure in many ways--a healthy, innocent rural farmer whose simple religious beliefs were abused by an evil man--uprooted and given extraordinary powers along with refinement and authority by his "god" and yet irrevocably corrupted in the process. In many ways this works as a dark counterpoint to the Pygmalion-style educational program the Doctor's putting Leela through, to her annoyance.

If Li-Hsen Chang is an interesting and complex adversary though, the same can't really be said for his master, Weng-Chiang himself. He's a rather unremarkable two-dimensional villain, I'm afraid, complete with hokey bad-guy laugh and over-the-top acting. Perhaps the writers were going for a sort of campy effect, but if so, they overdid it just a bit. At times too he's just more annoying than frightening--every time the ever loyal Li-Hsen is faithfully going about their nefarious business only to be thwarted by the Doctor, Weng-Chiang throws a fit, savagely berating the poor guy on and on ad nauseum. On this score, Weng-Chiang is less evil incarnate than a bad reminder of some dysfunctional manager at one's workplace. It doesn't help either that he bears no resemblance whatsoever to the clean-cut bureaucratic deity of education whom he's presumably impersonating, so that the whole idea comes across as altogether somewhat unconvincing.

All in all, though, this is an enjoyable adventure. The Doctor is at his sleuthing best, Leela shines as a displaced neolithic warrior, and a fine complement of vividly memorable supporting characters keep the story moving right along in an entertaining fashion, all of them brought to life by a fine script and even finer acting. And anyway, Li-Hsen more than makes up for Weng-Chiang's deficiencies as an interesting villain for most of the show, while the cyborg assassin Mr. Sin is genuinely creepy (especially if you have a phobia of ventriloquist dolls). So this is a fine storyline altogether as long as you take some of it with a grain of salt--or a dash of soy sauce, rather

The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was based on a pretty good graphic novel and as a movie, its pretty good itself.  Where else  could you ever hope to see the likes of Captain Nemo, Dorin Gray, Mina Harker, the Invisible Man, Dr. Jeckyl/Mr. Hyde, Allan Quatermain & Tom Sawyer all in the same movie?  About the only character the production is lacking is Sherlock Holmes.

The action and special effects in this movie are outstanding as are the performances from most of the actors.  The only real drawback is the length.  About 30 minutes could be excised from this movie without deleting any key scenes.  

All in all, a good popcorn flick.

5 stars to the film itself! Here's a painful study of a woman's descent to lunacy amidst a desolate, uncaring and eventually foreboding backdrop of  industrial waste. The character study is not unlike claustrophobic  Polanski's Repulsion but dwells on Vitti's being consumed by her external  surroundings as opposed to Deneuve's intensive plunge to schizophrenia. The  pace and landscape is virtual Antonioni so it may not appeal to viewers who  are not familiar with the director's works. One of his greatest works  (L'Avventura remains his best to me). The only problem is the DVD transfer.  I've seen the VHS and it has a consistent hue of orange. The DVD, although  sharper and clearer, fluctuates in hues from blues in medium shots to reds  and oranges in long shots. For a film that essentially deals with color (it  was Antonioni's first color feature), the transfer was rather clumsy and  careless. The sound is average but leaves a lot of room for improvement.  Why didn't Criterion handle the transfer of this gorgeous film

I'm not sure if the drills in this video are really championship calibre.  However, most of the drills that I used with my team were effective.  This video is for the first or second year Junior High coach (like myself) or any coach on the recreational level (ie. CYO and/or PAL coach or just in your driveway with your son or daughter).  They are not too difficult to follow and supplementary drills can be created easily enough. The narrator uses the expression "dual purpose" drills which translates into getting more than one benefit from any drill.  Combining shooting along with conditioning is used in most of the shooting drills.  For instance, a drill with 3 players, one shooter, one rebounder and one passer.  A simple drill but after the shooter shoots, he sprints to the wall and then back to his spot.  The timing is such that when he gets back to his spot, the passer is already passing the ball.  Thought this aspect of the drill was just staged for the video but when I tried it, it worked great!  Other drills also worked well like "shots across the lane" and a few of the rebounding drills.  The explanations were mostly of the drills themselves and not too much on the X's and 0's.  Added tips are given if you listen close enough and the foul shooting and regular shooting techniques are discussed in a clear concise manner which turned out to be my favorite part of the video.  The drills are forty five seconds to about a minute long.  The sample practices given at the end of the video will be extremely helpful to any recreational coach.  The video could have been more detailed with more theory (which I like), but in truth, it gives you just what it says.  Some very good drills along with a superior format for a sports instructional video make this a buy

How did he have the time to write such a picture, to co-direct it, to act in it and after everything else to write its score?  Noel Coward's energies, always remarkable, were redoubled during the second World War, and it must have seemed like another excuse to show off his patriotism, which he wore like a second skin despite his slummy upbringing.  IN WHICH WE SERVE is still worth watching, but it's nowhere as appealing as either CAVALCADE or THIS HAPPY BREED, and its focus on the "life and death of a ship" (the HMS Torrin) is strangely monomaniacal, almost constructivist.  Over and over you see unattributed bare arms hammmering away, symbols of brute strength like something from a Soviet film.  The ship goes up.  The ship goes down.  A new ship rises out of the water.  And in between Coward tries his hardest to keep you interested in the lives of the men clinging to the lifeboat, till our interest settles on three--Bernard Miles as Hardy, with his striking, long, hatchet face and the deep voice that goes with it--he should have played Ichabod Crane--John Mills as Blake, a tiny little pipsqueak who's feisty in the standard Mickey Rooney-Jimmy Cagney manner, and Noel Coward himself as Captain Kinross, tranquil with class privilege and, in the background, his glamorous marriage to the ineffable Celia Johnson (so beautiful till she opens her mouth and those bits of teeth wobble around on her gums).

Hitchcok's LIFEBOAT had the same concentration on a handful of downed and wet actors playing nautical, but without Coward's complicated flashback structure.  Coward stalwarts Joyce Carey and Kay Walsh show up as the love interests for Miles and Mills respectively--Carey, in this movie and in BRIEF ENCOUNTER as well, treated very unusually for the 1940s as a woman not in her first youth, nor good-looking in any way, who's given nevertheless a fullblooded and physical romantic interest.  She must have kissed the ground every time Noel Coward walked on it.  Who else would have written such roles for her?

The movie is trying indeed when it goes "serious," and yet that's half the fun of it, seeing how often Coward plays the "race" card--"we are an island race" indeed.  I teared up, of course I did, during the Blitz as the V-1 rockets drop bomb after bomb on London households, leading to the death of several favorite characters, and again when Coward leads his naval boys into Dunkirk and out of it again with a panoply of half-nude British soldiers sipping tea or what looks like an enormous vat of Kool-Aid.  Outside of these scenes, however, the movie is marred by its agitprop and by David Lean's tiresomeness, in showing everything at such a glacial pace.  

PS, the film was shot by Ronald Neame who later became a director himself and whose "masterpiece," THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, sometimes seems like a shot by shot remake of the disaster sequences of IN WHICH WE SERVE

Like Stuart Gordon's other venture into science fiction territory, the underrated and ill-fated ROBOT JOX, this is a nifty little film that was plagued by production difficulties and failed to find a theatrical distributor, which is a shame because its quite an enjoyable viewing experience. Everyone joins in the fun in this one, with Dennis Hopper delivering some unexpectedly funny bits of dialog, Debi Mazar and Stephen Dorff providing reliable 2nd banana support and Charles Dance having the time of his life with his horny half-metal madman. This Excellent DVD offers a chance to see this little sleeper in a great looking print with a fascinating and funny commentary by the Director.

  This is the first movie I remember seeing as a kid.  I LOVED it.  It was my favorite.  Then, I didn't get to see it again for several years (stupid Blockbuster!)  When I finally saw it again, I STILL liked it.  I like it as I write this very day.  The music is good (the background music behind the movie that nobody really conciously listens to, but helps the mood anyway).  The animation's good, too.  And I ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT! (How often does that happen?)  See, what happens a lot of the time, is that people blame colors they don't like, or designs  that are annoying, or WHATEVER on the animation.  But it isn't the animation's fault!  The way the thing on-screen MOVES is the only thing the animators do, mostly.  So, if you really want to criticize the animation, look at how they MOVE, not what they look like. Do you see?
   I think that, really, most of the reason that this is one of my favorite movies is that it is about BOOKS.  When I was little, my dad read me "The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe" and "The Hobbit"; things like that.  So, naturally, I loved books and stories.  This is practically the only movie I've seen that encourages reading so much while still being sincere.  It's obvious that the filmmakers themselves (or at least, a lot of the people working on it) actually like to read.  THAT'S really why I like the Pagemaster.

     So, if you like to read, watch this movie.  If you don't (you utter nincompoop), stay away, and don't criticize what you have no comprehension of

This is an imaginative take on the Jack and the Beanstalk story. While it was apparently made for kids, the story maintains enough complexity to keep adults interested (I'm 19). Plus as a female, I appreciate the fact that it's one of the few stories where (possible spoiler) the damsel (who's in a different kind of distress than other fairy tale women) rescues Prince Charming.  Well-acted, it features some great chemistry between Sara and Modine.  

But I still can't give it 5 stars.  Here's why (spoilers ahead):

1. I'm no math person but why couldn't the writers be consistent with when Jack's dad died? One minute, they say he died 20 years ago but then they say he died when Jack was 14. Since Jack is 37, it shows that the writers can't do simple addition. Couldn't they just take two seconds to do the math? 

2. How the hell does Siggy know about goose and harp? I got the impression from Wilhemina that Jack's dad didn't believe the story of the original Jack. But apparently, Jack's dad told Siggy not to tell him about the family's dark secret until he was ready. I wish there was a more believable explanation for Siggy knowing a lot more than he should. 

3. If Siggy is smart enough to know the all the Robinson secrets, I think he should be able to catch on to the fact that Jack is in love with Ondine fairly quickly. I always wondered why he didn't try to kill Ondine when he was so against Jack having an heir.  I understand that they had a time limit to the movie and maybe it would have been a bit scary for the little ones. Don't get me wrong, I don't want Ondine to die.  I wanted nothing less than a happy ending for her and Jack.  But shooting her (or at least threatening her) would have been a great way to kick up the tension/suspense. 

4. Siggy's accent and mannerisms were an attempt at comedy that
completely fell flat. It was not funny and was a bit gratuitous.

But if you're a fan of romance, adventure, or just feel-good movies in general, those things shouldn't keep you from enjoying this film.  Don't think too much about the plot holes- you'll go insane if you do

How families fall apart and mend themselves is the point of this star-laden 1996 movie, but stage and TV director Jerry Zaks, screenwriter Scott McPherson, and a trio of fine performances transcend the formulaic aspects to come up with something more resonant. Based on a play by McPherson before he succumbed to AIDS, the semi-autobiographical plot focuses on two estranged, middle-aged sisters. In Florida, mousey spinster Bessie has spent twenty years as caretaker to their ailing father Marvin and their eccentric aunt Ruth. In Ohio, Lee escaped family responsibility to get married and raise two sons in Ohio only to see things fall apart. Lee is on the verge of turning her life around as a licensed cosmetologist when Bessie is diagnosed with leukemia and reaches out to Lee and her sons as potential bone-marrow transplant candidates.

The rest of the movie is mainly about how the sisters cope with each other when they reunite and what they do to deal with the inevitable. Intriguingly, while the soap opera elements are strictly by-the-numbers, there is a persistent undercurrent of black comedy that effectively blunts the potential sentimentality of the piece. It also helps that Meryl Streep and Diane Keaton play the sisters. As the embittered, guilt-ridden Lee, Streep moves easily back into blue-collar, Silkwood territory, and she unapologetically shows the edginess and jealousy of her self-centered character. However, it's a vanity-free Keaton who really radiates as Bessie finding inner strength and contentment under increasingly dire circumstances. A year before "Titanic", Leonardo di Caprio effectively plays the last of his juvenile hellions as Lee's oldest son Hank, a textbook example of teenaged, pyromaniac angst.

The rest of the cast is fine in limited turns - Robert DeNiro (one of the producers as well) as the bumbling Dr. Wally; Dan Hedaya as his even more pixilated brother Bob; Gwen Verdon as wild-eyed, soap opera-obsessed Aunt Ruth; Hal Scardino as Hank's self-controlled little brother Charlie; and Hume Cronyn, who is forced to play Marvin with severely limited expression. There are predictable moments throughout, but some surprise and a few actually enthrall, including a seriocomic scene of quiet reconciliation when Bessie recalls the drowning death of her open-mouthed carny boyfriend. There are no extras with the 1999 DVD release

I'll get to the plot of "The Gang's All Here" in a minute, because the
plot isn't the most memorable part of this movie. The most memorable part is the bananas.

About 20 minutes into the movie, a towering hat of Technicolor fruitappears on the screen, followed by its owner--"Brazilian bombshell" Carmen Miranda. She proceeds to do a number called "The Lady in the Tutti-Frutti Hat," accompanied by chorus girls who bear bananas. Six-foot-tall bananas that continuously droop and sprout until number's end, when the chorus girls, worn out by the burden of this mutated fruit, lay down for a long siesta on a stage dressed up like an island.

There's a reason this number occurs so early on: It takes you the rest of the movie to convince yourself you actually saw this in a 1943 movie.

But then, this is Busby Berkeley, a director who staged his musical numbers as though he was declaring war. And next to kitsch, war is pretty much the motivator here.

The wafer-thin story involves Andy (James Ellison), a soldier who woos and wins Edie (Alice Faye), a canteen dancer, the nightbefore Andy goes off to World War Two. In what seems an instant, Andy gets decorated and returned home to a victory party thrown by the family of Andy's childhood sweetheart and fiancee--who, unfortunately for Edie, is not Edie.  
Will the heartbreak be resolved? Do you really care? The plot is
mostly an excuse for some snappy repartee between major '40s
stars (in particular, Eugene Pallette and Edward Everett Horton are
hilarious), and the kind of musical numbers that seem to drop out
of thin air. (In a couple of scenes, Benny Goodman and his
orchestra stroll by and do some songs just for the heck of
it.)

"The Gang's All Here" is really a 1943 time capsule, but an
eye-popping rouser of one. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
They didn't make 'em much like this back then, either

In a movie such as this, only James Cameron could do it justice. This documentary follows one of the most haunting disasters in the history of sea travel, and for that reason, everything had to be perfect and it was. The special effects are unparalleled, and the intricacy of the technological advances only exemplifies the rest of the good points of the movie. This probably could have gotten the remaining 0.5 points (going by the KAB scale, of course), except I was really hoping that the filmmakers would have explored the stern section of the ship, which, I believe was supposed to be located a half mile away from the bow section.

The KAB score: 9.5

I didn't give this five stars because it's some kind of Oscar-worthy achievement, but if you are a fan of the quirky, B-grade fantasy genre that had its heyday in the late seventies to late eighties, then this film is a must. "Hawk" offers hilarious jump-cut editing, dialogue that is spectacular in its badness, and probably the most memorable elf character ever put to film. 

For all that, the film is also remarkable for its innocence, in a time when cheesecake T&A fantasy like "The Sword and the Sorceress" and the infamous "Deathstalker" series were the norm, "Hawk the Slayer" keeps it clean, and is all the funnier for it.

If you have the right sort of friends, then snap this gem up, invite them over for beer and pizza, and have a go. It's more than worth it

"Lagaan" is a masterpiece.   The setting, the music, the full range of singing, the craving for love, - all provide stimulating background for the depth of a plot which portrays a strong young man, with failth in himself, and his refusal to be ground under by external forces beyond his control. You, the reader, must step up to the wicket, sooner than you may realize, and defend the slim sticks of your belief in defense of the innate dignity of mankind.

I am not a spring chicken, so I get introduced to anime through my daughter. Some of it is fluffy love stories or improbable characters or situations that appear from nowhere to solve the day. Full Metal is none of these. The characters are believable even when they are a talking metal suit of armor. Ed and Al are young boys. Their mother dies. They desparately want her back. They do something forbidden. They pay. And they learn what the costs are. The world is a confusing place. They navigate, sometimes on their own and sometimes with people who they meet along the way. Not everyone is who they seem at the start. Finally they confront the costs of their and other peoples violations of the rules. Through the story there is humor and growth. The story is told from their point of view. They do not give in to the tragedies that surround them and keep fighting for the truth and for each other. I highly recommend this series for young teens and old fogies (that's me). Much better than most things available for teens these days. I rank this up with Dante and Faust as literature about pacts made by people not understanding the full consequences of their actions fighting to restore the balance of their lives.

It seems to me there's a certain type of photographic quality in most of the 80s movies that sets them apart from any other era. I'm not arguing it's either better or worse than others, it just feels different and very distinctive. In this light, "Wall Street" reminded me vividly of "No Way Out" for instance - which happens to be from 1987 as well - and several De Palma films. Don't ask me why. It just does.

Useless considerations apart, "Wall Street", directed by always controversial Oliver Stone, pictures the almighty frenzy in corridors of high finance where no one has a chance to fade away. They always burn out, in a snap of fingers. And bigger they are, harder they fall, right?

The story in itself is nothing new or previously unseen, featuring a bright young "sport", Bud Fox (played by Charlie Sheen) who happens to have a lot of potential but is not exactly happy with his stock broker life. He wants more, and hotshot Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) is another broker who embodies everything he wants to become - powerful, vicious, influential and a sure winner. By sheer force of will and unprecedented persistence, Bud sneaks into Gekko's office and tries to prove his value to him. From here on the bulk of the movie shows us the average - but rather well executed in this particular instance - story of the young protegé who rises to the top at breakneck speed until, unexpectedly, something shatters his bond to the master. Something that hits home and makes Bud question his beliefs. What this is and how it plays out is the very heart of the movie, so I'll let that for you to find out if you didn't see it yet.

All the acting is quite superb, especially the relationship between Gekko and Fox. Martin Sheen - who is Charlie Sheen's father both in real life and on the screen - is particularly compelling as a man who believes in hard work, not selling out and not letting others - and yourself - down. He reminds me of Donald Sutherland simply because he also seems to have that ability to outshine everyone whenever he's on screen a couple of minutes at a time.

If you like high finance intrigue, big guys pulling the strings on each other, twists and turns, then "Wall Street" is probably essential. And it will probably give you an excuse to read Sun Tzu's "The Art of War"

In response to the earlier reviewer, this is Sergio Garrone's Django il Bastardo, not the other film the reviewer mentioned. Django il Bastardo is a small gem among Spaghetti Westerns, a low budget B movie in which a ghost (Django) avenges his own death (a topic later adapted by Clint Eastwood for his &quot;High Plains Drifter&quot;). Hence, Steffen's &quot;wooden&quot; acting is totally appropriate for the role. A little jewel with nice gothic atmosphere, innovative camera tricks and good supporting actors (a standout is Luciano Rossi as the main baddie's insane brother)

This thoughtfully prepared collection of 3 Buster Keaton movies, 2 shorts from early and late in his pre-feature period, and the feature Seven Chances, show a wide range of comedy styles, from slapstick, to more refined visual humor, to what we would today call situation comedy, where laughs come from unusual or embarrassing encounters. 

The earliest in the collection, "Neighbors" from 1920 is in some way the most satisfying of the set, although Keaton had not yet here fully developed his mature style of humor. Here there is still a stylistic resemblance to the earlier association with Fatty Arbuckle. The backyard love affair, for example, that opens the film resembles Arbuckle's 1915 classic "Fatty's Plucky Pup". In Neighbors there is more story, revolving around the standard theme of feuding parents, and the eventual need for the couple to elope. There is sweetness, youthful energy, and innocence in the entire movie, as well as great acrobatics, including the innovative climactic escape involving two levels of men being carried on the shoulders of other men. 

The Balloonatic (1923), near the end of the period in which Buster was making short films, is less rich in comic ideas and lacks the energy and freshness of the earlier film. There is almost no slapstick but rather visual humor involving being trapped in a balloon and trying to survive in the wild and win an unwilling girl. Keaton loves using bodies of water and other objects of nature for comedic props, and this film is full of them. Still, for once Keaton seems uninspired, perhaps making this film to fulfill a contract requirement rather than for love of the story.

The feature in the set, Seven Chances, from 1925, is based on a single theme: Buster, the rich boy down on his luck, must get married by the end of the day in order to inherit 7 million dollars. This absurd premise induces, for much of the film, a Hal Roach-like situation comedy rather than the visual, acrobatic style that is more associated with Keaton, as Buster is cornered into continuously proposing marriage to strangers. The variety of embarrassing rejections that Buster must endure has funny moments, but may not satisfy all of Buster's fans. The climax, however, returns us to tried and true Keaton formula: the lone man being chased by a thundering herd, in this case, of angry women in full wedding apparel, fed up at being duped by a newspaper ad submitted by Buster's colleague unbeknownst to Buster. The chase has satisfying moments, including Buster dodging large bolders. Although worth seeing, the reliance on the single absurd premise makes this film feel more like a dragged out short movie than a genuine feature. The result is a slightly less satisfying encounter with Keaton's genius.

In sanskrit, Ayurveda means the study of life. According to ancient Hindu texts, all healing systems stem from Ayurvedic medicine. This Ancient Ayurveda series dvd, led by Sarah Tomlinson with clarity and insight, provides a blueprint for increasing self-awareness through the use of asana, symbol and metaphor. Tomlinson, acts like a loving guide to going inward and discovering new self-truths. To effectively bring about change in our bodies and minds, we must change habitual patterns in the body. The poses in the series takes us through a full range of challenging movements, and Tomlinson illuminates the wisdom of this practice by brilliantly threading together how the poses evoke certain states of mind and spirit. Filmed against a simple, soothing background, Tomlinson wisely avoids distracting bells and whistles. Instead, the accompanying chanting by ayurveda master Gandharva,directly relates to the series in it's use of each of the planetary mantras. 
Tomlinson's has a great depth of knowledge about ayurveda, and she weaves many subtle suggestions and information about the benefits of each pose into the practice. This dvd is appropriate for beginner and advanced student: beginners will feel supported and encouraged, as well as exhilirated by the practice, and more experienced students will appreciate the multi-level aspect of Tomlinson's class.

This movie is intimate and special. Some reviews say it is the story of obsession, of fetishism, of trivial things. However, this movie is the story of something special in a young teenage boy's life: his fantasy woman. 
   The character Malena rarely speaks throughout the movie, but we see her exactly how we are supposed to see her- through the eyes of an old man telling the story of himself in young "love". This perspective makes her ideal and special, with few flaws,as a fantasy woman is to a young man. Malena is instantly a likeable character, not awful and disgusting like those using her. 
   We cannot forget that our narrator, Renato, is not actually a teenage boy but an older man telling his own story. Therefore, he is unreliable as a narrator. Malena's sins are washed clean through his judgement, and we believe him when we see her victimized by the other women. However, Renato has had years to think about everything, to contemplate what really happened to her. So, in the end, the people who use her are completely despicable, unable to garner any liking. 
   Of course, she is a victim, but she eventually falls into the gossip that others believe she is guilty of with the men. The movie does offer a hint that she could have escaped all of the problems: she is from another city and her husband, for most of the movie, is dead. Yet, she chooses to not escape but to stay, and her fate is sealed.
    The music in the movie was nominated for Best Score in 2000,and it is beautiful, emotional. It truly adds to the feeling of the movie. 
    I would recommend this movie to anyone for the compelling story, emotion, and characters. You will never forget this movie.

I can't believe that no one else has reviewed this dvd. take advantage of the low price and BUY THIS NOW! i'm no expert on the HOT ROD scene, but this was very enjoyable. The footage of pinstripe artist SKRATCH is worth the price alone.
    I would say anyone who is into watching creative people do something artistic and original will really love this. you get to see the creative process of some great project cars, as well as getting into the motivation of some of the builders and car club members. I will definitely be watching this one a few times

I think that anyone who believes this movie to be "hilarious" or Hudson's performance "overrated" and "over-the-top" in her singing just doesn't like musicals.  Or perhaps doesn't like an all black cast (I am not black) or is too young to understand the 60's world of music and payola and backstabbing.  

While touted to be similar to the experiences suffered by The Supremes with Diana Ross as its lead singer, it is close in some aspects and totally far away in others.  The key words here are "loosely based" on the story of the Supremes.  Why people, including Ross herself don't get that is beyond me!

Over the top? If anyone saw the original play with Jennifer Holliday (I did see it) then you don't know the meaning of over the top.  That character was supposed to be that way and Hudson did a wonderful job of that.  Her performance overrated?  Hogwash!  She deserved all the accolades she received as a novice actress. Murphy did one of his best acting jobs ever! Beyonce's performance was good but not great.  This was in part because her character while prominent was not the focus of the movie nor was it of the play. This was Beyonce's best acting performance thus far though she still needs some work and the "right" role.  This was not the right role for her in my opinion.  Hudson's character is the main and central character which puzzles me for the "supporting actress" win.  Though as lead actress she probably would have lost.

You people out there, don't take my word for this movie's greatness and take on a true part of history even if it was "white-washed," no pun intended.  Or don't think its a bad movie like some other critics here.  YOU MUST JUDGE FOR YOURSELF.  I hope and think  that you won't be disappointed. There are some more than subtle references to The Supremes and Diana Ross especially in some of the costumes, Beyonce's images and album covers (CD covers for you youngsters)BUT only die hard fans of the Supremes and people who were there at that time would know that.  ENJOY

The sound quality and the quality of musicians is insanely good.  I bought this primarily to see Jaco.  The biggest distraction was the bits of James Dean and Doo Wap music videos from the 50's added in.  I wish this was remastered with just the concert performances.  Also, it appears to me that the Jaco Bass solo was cut.  I still give it 5 stars regardless.

I had the distinct pleasure of seeing Richard Jeni live a few years ago and I gotta tell you that I really almost peed my pants. He was astoundingly funny. This DVD definitely captures his comic genius, although it is woefully short compared to the amazing talent that he is and that he expressed in the huge amount of material he developed.

It was incredibly sad to see that he took his own life which, from what I heard, was based at least in part on the fact that he was not able to get the gigs he used to get, which is itself really sad. He developed what I think is the best comedy, which is comedy that stings and bites because it reveals us human beings as full of weaknesses that are, ultimately, pretty stupid in the face of everything good in this world.

He will be sorely missed in this world that needs more people to show us all the dumb things we do...and by doing so, how we should and can be a lot better than we are

The Truth About Cats and Dogs is a thoroughly enjoyable, refreshing movie. Janeane Garofalo uses her bread and butter acting technique of playing a cynical, depressed, miserable, pessimistic character who sees herself as an ugly duckling who no man could want. 

Of course, she's not really acting. That's really her: lock, stock, and barrel. The miserable, pessimistic, vicious act isn't an act at all.

The fly in the ointment to this movie is that Uma Thurman is not a knockout. Of course, some men would prefer the tall, thin blonde over the short brunette, but the basis of the movie hinges on Uma being the gorgeous woman and Janeane being average. But it doesn't work when you believe it's the other way around. Uma Thurman has certainly looked good in some movies, but she looks haggard here.

Bottom Line: A good film about the "ugly duckling" getting the guy. Based on the classic Cyrano de Bergerac story, just like Roxanne starring Steve Martin

Oh! How I will never forget seeing the re-release of this film.
It was in 1974 and I could not keep my eye's from it.It is now
2006 and I still can't.What this movie is to me is a place in
my heart and being a avid collector of films from the silents
to the classics and obscure I find that very meaningful.If you
have not seen 7th you are missing out. It truly is a funtastic
film.I put this above Jason and the argonauts for my reason
alone(I KNOW I STAND ALONE IN THIS FOR JASON HAS MORE 
monsters and the great Ray Harryhausen has said JASON
is his fav.along with many of his fans).What 7th has above
Jason for me is MUSIC! A soundtrack to a film has always
been a extra push to a film and the 7th voyage has that
extra push on Jason.Bernard Herrman's score is so dreamlike
you can close your eyes and leave 7th on and the music is 
trancelike especially the snake woman dance.Please anyone
who reads this have 7th voyage in your collection(Jason
& the argonauts too for that matter).You wont be dissapointed
I will always be grateful to have seen this on the big screen
and never forget it,I hope when you watch Ray Harryhausen's
children and Bernard Herrman's music come to life you too
will not forget it.Some say Gone with the wind,Wizard of Oz
Casablanca,Citizen Kane,Jaws, Star Wars(77), Superman(78)
E.T. Titanic,2001 a space & Pulp Fiction.Not me! If I was
on a island and could only have one film from my library
(ouch!I have alot of films and alot I love)but I would
have to pick The Seventh Voyage.That would be the one 
for me on the island.And please let it be the isle of
colossus.

Richard Dreyfuss is excellent as a cop on a stakeout (along with partner Emilio Estevez) of pretty Madeleine Stowe (they have to watch her house through the night), and he falls in love with her. Before the movie is over there's a big car chase and an exciting climax in a lumber mill with a killer (Aidan Quinn). It's pretty standard fare for this kind of cop movie, but the script is above average - especially the dialogue - and Dreyfuss's performance is right on target. A very entertaining movie; definitely worth a watch

This movie was much better than "Vanilla Sky."  "Vanilla Sky" mostly copied "Open Your Eyes" but was too obvious and less convincing.  (And Tom Cruise, though good in some roles, didn't fit this role well.)  "Open Your Eyes" takes a little longer to draw you in, but once it has you there it takes you far beyond where "Vanilla Sky" does. Also, the Jungian Dream aspect in "Vanilla Sky" is poorly done, whereas "Open Your Eyes" represents the dream experience very well.  I recommend watching both movies before you buy one.  But if you're going to buy, get "Open Your Eyes.

Robert Redford has proved us his undeniable artistic gifts in previous occasions, but with this giant movie he really achieved that coveted pearl; the state of art in all its wholeness.

Redford crossed over the traditional concessions and he got to prove art and cinema should not be divorced: good taste and profitability may gather and shake hands, if you respect the sensibility and intelligence of the spectator.

This picture not only broke the walls and not only became the most ambitious, artistic and perfect American film in the last quarter of Century; besides, the mature and sensitive script around an awful event that will transform the livings and expand the reduced frontiers of two different ways of life, enhancing them when the tragedy became an unexpected gate for the bliss.

Redford' s artistic personality has a secure place in the immortality and I really hope for him to bring us future films filled of that enriched vision where the rude vulgarity, the visible special effects big circus and the simple anecdote not only be absent; and so the new directors to come, understand the true cinema meaning is ART. 

Thanks to his generous personal effort, for having created the Sundance Festival for new directors whose fruits will create new approaches and major visions.             

Special kudos to him due that clinical eye for a very young actress in progress at those years: 
Scarlet Johansson.

This was the first silent film that I saw in its entire form. The 1927 King Of Kings, directed by Cecil B. Demille. As with D.W Griffth, Charlie Chaplin, and Greta Garbo, he is right up their amoung silent icons. This movie, starring H.B. Warner as Jesus is a truely a jewel of a film. Everyone knows the story, but it is told very well here. Demille knew his bible films, like Ten Commandments(1924,1956) Samson And Delilah and this movie, The King Of Kings. The film maybe dated a tiny bit, but can the story of Jesus be dated. I love Jesus movies, like Jesus Of Nazareth, The Greatest Story Ever Told. The 1961 King of Kings, and the musicals Jesus Christ Superstar and Godspell. And the story of Christ was also tackled in the 1916 D.W Griffth classic Intolerence. But this film is broughhow much t out in much better detail. The special effects are amazing for 1927, the crucifixion scene is astondishing,and a scene in color, which is the resurrection scene.The cast of characters is also amazing. In our era of movies, if you need a big scene, a will have only 100 people, and CGI the other tens of thousands. Since there was no CGI back in 1927, or computers for that matter, they directors like Demillie and Griffth had to actually get thousands of extras for there scenes in these epics. I know people think silents are boring but for an 18 year old, they are a gateway to the past. Without those groundbreaking films, no one would care about movies. Those early silents were the catalyst for what would become. I would recommend this film.  This movie is a true classic, no matter what religion you are

My little boy who is 8 years old loves this movie.  He goes around acting like the characters from the movie!  He really likes Harold and keeps watching the movie over and over again hoping for a different ending.  He is also convinced that they should make a Midnight Madness 2 and let Harold win the next time!  This is a great movie, with a young Michael J. Fox in it, and has no sex or violence and is a very kid friendly movie

Instead of reviewing the content, my review is based more on the DVD Presentation.

Pros: The Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack is just excellent, with great separation of instrument up front and in back and the great use of surrounds for more that just audience cheering. Sound is only second to the Shakira Unplugged Dvd.

Cons: Who ever mastered this DVD must be living in 1997. This concert was recorded in HD and is usually shown on MTV HD network. The big mistake being that the concert is not Anamorphic(Enhanced for 16x9 Televisions). Sure the majority will not care, but for those of you who own HD monitors, you will see the negative in losing that extra resolution and the fact that you have to manually zoom in.

Second negative being that if you want to start the concert from a specific song, you have to start the concert from the beginning and skip ahead. Because if you try to start from the "Song Selection" menu, it will take you back to the menu every time the song you selected ends. 

Overall a great concert, but a disappointing DVD presentation

I am not a horror movie fan, in fact there are very few horror movies that have truly scared me, but this one indeed made me literally crap myself. I caught this movie during the midnight hours on IFC 2 years ago, and luckily the movie was just starting, so I got to see it from beginning to end. This movie is basically about a man named Frank Zito (Joe Spinell) who's a psychotic serial killer who seeks pleasure by killing women, because he feels he's getting back at his abusive mother who was also a prostitute. After her death Frank feels alone, but cannot forget the mistreatment he received from her all those years. 

Frank lives in a tiny apartment in New York City, in which he keeps several mannequins. He uses these mannequins by putting his victim's bloody scalps, on it's heads. When he spots a woman named Anna (Caroline Munro), a photographer in the park taking pictures he gains a sudden interest in her, but not the type of interest in which he wants to murder her, but kind of a romantic interest. He takes her out to dinner and buys her gifts, but will he change his mind about her, and make her become another one of his victims? 

Some of the scenes in this film are so incredibly gut-wrenching, especially the scene when he chases a nurse into a subway station, and she hides in a bathroom stall. I felt my heart pounding the whole entire time. The effects were realistic (Nice Job Tom Savini!), they don't come close to todays, even though the movie was released in 1980.  Joe Spinell plays this part so well that you might think he was for real, and not only that, but he physically looked the part too . The scenes where he's in his apartment talking to his mannequins are some of the most creepiest scenes I have ever seen in a movie. I believe that this film is one of the most realistic horror films out there, because we get to see the results of how an alone, mistreated child might turn out. This isn't one of those lame zombie movies, it's the real deal. If you like horror, and a lot of gore, and you haven't seen this then I recommend you watching this.

I was blown away by the wonderful acting of Juliet Lewis and Giovanni Ribisi who played the retarded young adults. This was a very compassionate film about the realities of living with a disability. Disabled people desire and deserve to have the same opportunities as everyone else. It was wonderful to see the love "Carla"'s siblings and parents had for her. There were 2 reasons I didn't give this movie 5 stars. One was that Diane Keaton's character of the overly controlling mother was annoying. Obviously she was supposed to be annoying, but I think she overacted a bit and she needed better lines, she seemed to say the same stuff over and over again. Another reason I didn't love this film was because Hollywood once again compels right wing nut jobs to write reviews that portray themselves as normal and good. Sorry, Hollywood, but there will always be those of us who still believe God's word to be true. Being a right wing nut job isn't considered normal or ok in the bible. God never created it. Look it up. You are not helping people who struggle with it to be set free from that addiction and lonely lifestyle.

His tell it like it is and living life approach is great. If you can't go to see him in a live performance this is the next best thing. Be prepared to laugh so hard your sides ache.  Keep an open mind and go for the ride!

I like this video for it's frankness and straight forward approach of a woman enjoying herself. Like yoga, it requires slowing down and noticing how your body feels while your watching it. The energy slowly rises and the woman increases it by playing with the tempo and rhythm of her touches.
The quality of her session is unhurried and she is very relaxed and keeps her body still but her finger is moving in synchronicity with her orgasm. I found that in itself very interesting and different.
It is refreshing to find a product that is different from the common depiction of women emulating ecstasy but one in which shows a woman actually really feeling what it feels like to create it in her body and show what it looks like.
She shows a way of masturbating and stretching the sensation out that can really tweak your reality of how much pleasure a woman is capable of experiencing, a mind bender so to speak, and it challenges the cultural limitations of what orgasm is for a woman and how she experiences it

This DVD is a great complement to the DVD's offered by VCE(Trinity and Beyond, Nukes in Space, etc). By itself, it is a highly technical look at the process of testing materials, military equipment, and building materials during three atomic test series covered on the DVD set. The quality of the film varies between the three discs. The last Civil Defense video on Disc 2 suffers a lot of audio warble, unfortunately. But, it is nice to see these important historical documents preserved in a digital format.

I've owned Trinity and Beyond for several years, and I really enjoy the way it is presented. But, it has to cover so many tests in a short amount of time that it skims over a lot of information about testing procedures, etc. You begin to get the impression that the military was doing these tests for their own amusement. After watching this DVD, I have a much better understanding of the entire process. It's easy to see why the military was eager to do so many tests in the early days of the atomic weapons program. The science of the atomic bomb was a moving target, and this DVD outlines the research they made. 

Though I would never like to see anyone use atomic weapons ever again, their sheer power is fascinating, beautiful, and frightening at the same time. If you are interested in the science of atomic testing, you should really take a look at this set

One only needs to watch Ball of Fire to realize the depth of Barbara Stanwyck's incredible talent.  I'd match her up against ANY ACTRESS of her era or any other era!!  Here is a woman who can rip your heart out...even when she plays unlikeable characters because she always lets you see multi-dimensions of her characters.  Sugarpuss O'Shea is a perfect example of a bad girl with a soft heart who succumbs to the love a naive, good-looking gentleman.  But she also shows her love to the other professors.  1941 was Stanwyck's greatest Movie Year.....she made "Meet John DOe" and "The Lady Eve" in this year as well and she is excellent in all of them.  Stanwyck is the ONLY ACTRESS I CAN THINK OF who CAN DO ANYTHING!!  From drama to comedy, to musicals and of course westerns!!  While Stanwyck's singing is not on a par with her other talents (her singing was dubbed in Ball of Fire) she can still do a musical song and dance as is evidenced in her 1937 film (THIS IS MY AFFAIR where she plays a vaudeville entertainer).  Bette Davis could never play comedy and was too mannered with her rapid fire clipped speech and overacting.  SHe couldn't sing or dance (as Barbara did in Ball of FIre, Lady of Burlesque, This is My Affair and Banjo on My Knee).  Katharine Hepburn was a good actress but very unnerving also with her mannerisms, high patrician attitude and SHE COULD NEVER PLAY A PART IN A MUSICAL.  SHE COULDN'T SING).  Joan Crawford was a good actress in good movies but very few of her movies are good and she couldn't sing.  Doris Day was brilliant in comedy, musicals and drama but she would never be believable as a villainess or a heavy.  The same with Judy Garland.  Rare is the talent who could do it all.  I dare anyone to disagree with me that Stanwyck was the ONE who could do it all....Drama, Comedy, Westerns, Musicals!! Heroine or villainess! Stanwyck's work is always FIRST CLASS even when applied to material that is not.   She was simply the greatest and I'm sorry this review has turned into a tribute to Stanwyck but she should have won the Oscar in 1941 for Ball of Fire when she proved that she was the greatest actress in that wonderful era of actresses!!  The movie, Ball of Fire is great fun!!  From beginning to end Stanwyck and Cooper are unbeatable!!!  And the other professors are hilarious to watch as well!!  There is also a marvelous musical score and the production values are top notch!

Just today I randomly selected a movie, that movie was "Henry".  I had never heard of it before, and I figured that I was in for your average, run-of-the-mill low budget slasher flick.  Though it is low budget, it is by no means your ordinary serial killer movie.  In fact, the gritty film and minimalist effects only adds to the stark realism of this nightmarish character study.

Meet Henry, a very quiet and serene man with vacant and staring eyes as well as a calm disposition.  Watch as he goes to work, watch as he hits the bar with his buddy Otis, and watch as he calmly and systematically butchers random people.  This film does not exploit the violence though; it is very frank and direct, treating it as though Henry were doing nothing more than cleaning the dishes or taking a stroll in the park.

This movie is a lot of things, and when it was all over, I just had to sit back and take a few breaths, have a cigarette - and try to gauge my reaction(s).  I was surprised to note that while this film is disturbing, it is also pretty funny in some parts, though only funny in the blackest sense of the term.  There is no social commentary in this movie, nor does it provide any closure.  

The DVD is great, awesome extras including fragmented interviews with the genuine serial killer Henry Lee Lucas, awaiting lethal injection on death row.  Very fascinating

I read the various reviews about the movie "The Hunter".  I was surprised at the extremeties in preference.  Much like owning a Fiero,  . . . . which I do.

The movie, as is the Fiero, is overall slower than most of McQueen's.  However, he still pulls it off, showing his great acting ability.  When you take the character, "Papa" Thorson,  he was a different breed in the wrong time era.  Who else, but McQueen could make him so realistic?

I haven't seen the movie in several years. I have been wanting a copy to add to my library.  I intend to do that today.

Oh yeah, the relationship between the movie and the Fiero?  I have found that there are those that either dearly love it or wish they had never laid eyes on it.  I loved "The Hunter" and I love my Fiero.  For those of you who don't understand, . . . "sorry"!  Steve McQuen displayed more of his talent, even while ill.   God bless you, Steve and thank you for the entertainment you gave us

When I hear the alarm go off and the opening strains of Henry Mancini's piano creep in, I know I'm preparing for that journey into the best alcohol induced haze of the 80s on the "Crawford Memorial Interstate-81".  Stops along the way include...

Adoption Wars

Birthday Exploitation

Unfair Life

Being Let Go

Rose Rage

Raw (Rare) Steak

One Award

Taking that special exit for "Wire Hanger Etiquette"

Christmas Propaganda

Chadwick, Love, and A Snitch

Near Death Experience

Banishment

Making Up

Soft Drink Wars

Loss

New Beginnings

New Losses

Last Moments

And Last Words before taking that final exit back to reality.


In a world filled with "F*** Me" Heels, Booze, Domestic Disputes and the biggest Taboo of them all, "Wire Hangers"...  We all know She's a Movie Star, She a Bitch, She Dresses Well and She's Rich. (Quoting John Waters)

I've watched this so many times that I need therapy

This is a thuroughly enjoyable movie; a pleasure to watch. THe acting, characters, and story are entirely plausible, and there is no grandstanding by primadonna actors, nor is there any of Hollywood's usual political preachiness (especially unusual considering Robert Redford's backing). 

THe only downside to the DVD is that it is full-screen, and not letterboxed. THe "bonus features" are somewhat lack-luster as well, and the menu system is laughable. Only one actor's credits have been updated since the movie was released, and the credits section is a token gesture at best.

Still, this is one of those cases where it is cheaper to buy the movie than rent it twice

Long before the advent of the written word sacred knowledge was handed down through the generations via the vehicles of ritual, song and dance. I have come to believe that the 'old ways' were in many cases the superior mode of transmission. Mere words could never convey the multi-faceted beauty, wonder and awe that can be expressed in sacred song and dance. This point is made crystal clear in this exquisite production of 'Holo Mai Pele.'

'Holo Mai Pele' is an exciting and exotic multi-media production that I found absoultely engrossing. The director seamlessly moves the viewer back and forth between the preparation of the event in the dance studio, the on-stage performance and beautiful film footage of the enchanting Hawaiian landscape. The on-stage performance is also greatly enhanced by a large screen behind the dancers showing footage of volcanic eruptions, lava flows and lush tropical rainforests. All of this is underscored by an intermitent narrative explaining the history of the hula and the mythological tale of the volcano Goddess Pele and her battle with her youngest sister Hi'iaka. The narrative is the perfect compliment to the production and in no way detracts the viewer from the performance.

This DVD serves as both a wonderful introduction to the novice in Hawaiiana and a much needed and revered document to the initiated providing a performance that attests to the power and immense beauty of the hula and its embodiment of the Hawaiian 'Spirit of Aloha.' Truly a sacred visual document to be treasured.

driller killer has, without question, the best director's commentary of any dvd i have ever seen. although driller killer is a far cry from his second film &quot;ms. 45&quot; it is a classic. reno can't seem to buy a thrill. despite the fact that he lives with two bombshells he can't get his painting finished to collect for the rent. his agent's reaction to his finished painting is absolutely priceless. what's worse is that his landlord has allowed a punk band to move in upstairs, adding insult to injury. the band, tony coca cola and the roosters, play &quot;the grand street stomp&quot; a guitar riff that has a great driving force. this film really documents the viallge punk circuit at the end of the 1970's. conventions are borrowed from polanski's &quot;repulsion&quot; and cassaveetes' &quot;shadows&quot;. the handheld mingling with the street people of the period shows how filthy NYC was at the time. Lots of fun. Driller Killer was meant to be listened to loud

Although many reviewers didn't like the second part of the "Hills", I still wouldn't call it "one of the worst sequels ever" or "the worst Wes Craven film". Certainly this is not a masterpiece, even in the framework of horror genre, but I don't see why it should be worse than any other slasher flick. When I was watching it, I came to a conclusion early Wes Craven had been imitating other directors rather often. I'm not saying he was not original at all - eventually he shot "A Nightmare on Elm Street" in 1984. But "The Hills Have Eyes" were reminiscent of "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", and in the beginning of 80s, when slasher era started, I guess Craven decided to make something in the same manner. Maybe the reason was Craven's long-time buddy Sean Cunningham created "Friday the 13th" in 1980, and Wes was envious? :) Anyway the second part of "The Hills Have Eyes" turned out to be a pure slasher like many others at that time. And it obviously wasn't the worst and in many ways was like above mentioned "Friday the 13th": the score was written by Harry Manfredini, known to every "Friday" fan, and the music in "Hills 2" is just like in early "Fridays". The body count increased comparing to the first part and approached a regular slasher movie. Kevin Blair who had a leading male part here, would star in "Friday the 13th part VII" a couple of years later along with Kane Hodder, who did stunts for "The Hills Have Eyes 2" and in "Friday" would play you know whom. 
Of course here we can see some stupidities as in other slasher movies (like characters wandering in night all alone instead of sticking together, all the big strong guys get killed, and a handicapped girl survives - I'm not even considering it as a spoiler for it is obvious from the very beginning, especially if you've seen a couple of horror films in your life), but is that a problem for a true horror fan? We've learned not to take this trivia into account. 
So I think "The Hills Have Eyes 2" managed on many levels, and it would be interesting to have it in your collection, if you have the first one. For they are two totally different films talking about the subgenres of horror.

We must thank the director and salute Sigourney Weaver's beautiful performance: this movie gives us a rare insight into the lives and minds of the gentle, yet ferocious, giant mountains gorillas. It is also the amazing journey of an extroardinary woman who went to live by herself in a remote mountain of Rwanda, secluded from the world. She lost much of her sanity, as well as her life, in the process of saving the lives of a few hundred remaining gorillas. Without her work, who knows who could have saved them from savage murder and total extinction? Thanks to her work and dedication, a "lost cause" had been heard at last. 

The struggle for the survival of the "Great Apes" is not totally over though. One must hope that the abject poverty and the political unrest that still affect the region, as well as the illegal poaching and smuggling of goods and animals across borders - that happen with or without government officials' approval in each country involved - and the continuing deforestation and fauna's loss of habitat, can one day all come to an end so that the survival of these amazing creatures can be achieved. 

One must recognize the sacrifices and thank people like Diane Fossey, conservationists around the world, and the Rwandese people in particular, who have made it possible so far despite great internal economic and political pressures. All hope is not lost!

I loved the artistic topics of Art & Music in this particular Little People DVD.  And I have to say, this is one of our favorites.  But I do agree with the other reviewer about the duplicate episodes showing up in each DVD.  If you have other LP movies, then you will feel slightly dissapointed to see the episodes repeating themselves here and there.  I also agree that the menu setup could be better, with all 10 episodes playing back-to-back, rather than split into 5 at a time the way they currently are.  Otherwise, this is still a great DVD - much better than the LP Storytime Collection

What is it with the British film scene and its distinctly gritty style. It seems that if we're not producing trashy Ealing comedies, it's a shocking reality drama with the likes of Ray Winstone in it? 
Well Ray Winstone isn't in this one, but he could well be as the Rat Catcher is another one of those 'you either enjoy challenging films or you don't' pieces.
I personally love them, I guess I must be a miserable bugger! Of course this film investigates the reality of the underclass, dysfunctional life lived in a rough and grimey housing estate.  But it is unique (well probably not unique) in that it is told pretty much entirely from the view of the 12 year old boy, played by William Eadie, who is struggling to make some sense of what is going on around him.  
We learn that no matter what environment children grow up in, they always seem to hold true and remain untainted somehow.  
Without wishing to give too much away, it is the final brief scene of this film which has stayed in my mind ever since I watched it in 2000. Worth the wait if you like being deeply moved by simple things

This is a showcase of Jet Li's brand of martial arts...fast and furious. While this is no Fist Of Legend the movie has enough action to keep the exitement going. What I did'nt anticipate was the humor. Absolutely lots of laughs to pick up where the action stops. Once persons are prepared to judge this movie on it's own merit they will see that this movie was worth buying

AFI finally release a live DVD, and as a portrayal of the band as it stands now, it is very impressive. It does lack older, more hardcore punk tracks, but that is to be expected as the band grows and matures into the  band it is now. Each album progresses towards more epic scales, and songs balance beauty with power. "I Heard a Voice" captures this on film, and the fan gets to witness AFI at their most grandiose. Watching vocalist Davey Havok sing "God Called in Sick Today" while being held up by the audience is amazing to watch and gives this reviewer chills everytime. The masterful command of theatrics from each member, especially Havok, creates a powerful feeling unable to fully describe but easy to appreciate. The setlist itself is perfectly put together, with the only gripe being the exclusion of "Kiss and Control." The rest of the songs display all facets of AFI, from the fast paced "Dancing Through Sunday",(which includes a nicely executed guitar solo by guitarist Jade Puget) "Kill Caustic", "Death of Seasons", "Totalimmortal" and "A Single Second", (the last of which features a guest appearance by Nick 13 of Tiger Army) to the slower paced "This Time Imperfect" and "Endlessly, She Said" as well as all of their recent singles, and a few more cuts from their latest releases "Decemberunderground" and "Sing the Sorrow". Extras are geared towards the fans, with Despair Faction interviews and the inclusion of videos from their massive scavenger hunt prior to the Decemberunderground release, as well as a poster. 

Each band member has their moments to shine, and are all very capable and talented muscians. Bassist Hunter Burgan and drummer Adam Carson lay down a solid foundation as well as background vocals, as Puget layers his unique guitar sound and obvious mastery, in this genre, over the instrument. This is all built up to allow Havok to use his unique vocal approach to wander in between melodies and notes, mixing powerful singing with a fantastic screaming voice, to create beautiful atmospheres of sound that can crash down on you just as easily as it hypnotizes you.

The quality of the sound production as well as the video edits are fantastic. Unlike other live DVD's, where the concert is edited to the point of a music video, "I Heard a Voice" has just the right amount to not make you forget you are watching a live dvd, but also add to the overall effect of the performance. The sound is very clear, and the sound levels are perfectly set to allow each member to cut through the mix. 

This is overall a very stellar production, and fans who have already embraced the new direction of the band, as well as new fans and casual fans, should find the dvd to be quite entertaining and a very worthwhile buy

I'm pretty new to the Yoga experience. I started with a Kathy Smith DVD (hated it!) then I got a Yoga Zone Video -- the one for flexibility and toning and I found it to be very good. I then got another video -- Yoga Shakti which is excellent too and I was looking for another beginner video (the Yoga Shakti one has some advanced parts in it) so I bought Yoga Zone -- Introduction to Yoga. While some of the moves in it are on my first video, I still found this to be very good for beginners. Alan again teaches you the breathing technique -- which I often forget.  I noticed on another review someone complained about the slowness of it. Yes, it does move slow HOWEVER if you're a beginner and you're just learning the poses, the last thing you would want is for it to move fast. He takes the time to explain each pose and how it should feel when you're doing it. His voice is very soothing and puts me in a calm frame of mind.

I honestly have to say that if I did NOT originally buy a yoga zone dvd, I more than likely would not have pursued the practice.  I think that Yoga Zone is what has gotten me more into it and wanting to practice more and learn more.

I highly suggest this dvd to any beginner yoga-lite out there

"Backbeat" is an excellent portrayal of the Hamburg phase of the early Beatles, and succeeds on every level.  Although purportedly intended primarily to tell the story of "fifth Beatle" Stuart Sutcliffe, the focus quickly shifts to John Lennon who (as in real life) dominated the music and lives of the early Beatles.  It is as much the story of Stu and John as the story of Stu and Astrid, and explores the dynamics of both complex relationships.  Still, it is a fascinating look at the early Beatles, who paid their dues by playing in some of the rough Reeperbahn bars in the pre-fame years.  The cast is excellent, and were obviously chosen for their talent rather than their resemblance to the characters they portrayed.  The music is also excellent, and complements the story perfectly.  In all, "Backbeat" is an entertaining journey through the world of the early Beatles, and is well worth purchasing for repeat viewings.

David Cromemberg did an excellent job with the adaptation of Stephen King's novel, and Christopher Walken was superb in his portrayal of Johnny Smith (no middle initial).  The supporting cast added to the film:  Martin Sheen was a convincing Greg Stilson (was this a warm up for his West Wing role?), I'm a big fan of Tom Skerritt, and I didn't recognize Herbert Lom from his Pink Panther role.

This movie (and the book) are put in the horror genre, but I would consider the story to be true science fiction.  Smith's character was in a coma for several years, and the story's premise is that this coma enabled his brain to tap into psychic ablilities.  There is nothing supernatural about the villains; they're just normal bad people.

This movie is not completely faithful to the movie.  Some of the changes are to make it fit a moderately lengthed movie (104 minutes) instead of a 400+ page novel.  Some of the changes add moderate suspense, keeping the interest of someone who read the novel first.  I do question the need for some of the changes -- I don't know why Johnny Smith's psychic abilities required personal contact in the movie (he could learn things touching people's clothes or a geographic spot in the book), and I didn't think it was necessary of having his tutoree be a younger boy in the movie instead of a teenager as in the book (this made for what I considered weaker parts of the movie).

True science fiction is effective because it takes a normal person, puts them in an abnormal situation, and thus investigates the person's character.  Due to the time constraints of the movie, it did not as effectively deal with the wrestlings of conscience Smith had, but they were not absent either.  As a result, the story (both book and movie) have a feel of a classic tragedy.

This movie is not for children, though it could have easily gained a PG rating (this movie came out the year before PG-13 was introduced).  The R rating was gained by one usage of the F-word, a couple of seconds of a revealed breast, and a short gruesome scene involving the death of a character.  (Cromemberg has a reputation for gruesomeness in his other movies, like "Scanners", "Videodrome", and the 1986 remake of "The Fly"; this movie had him more subdued, but very effective.)

Besides the R-rating, there are aspects of the story (equally true in the novel as in the movie) that I find disturbing as a fundamentalist minister.  This is because of its dependence on situation ethics.  Adultery and murder are considered acceptable on the part of Johnny Smith because of the situations.  

In spite of these misgivings, I think this was an excellent movie.  I think it was worthy of several awards, such as acting nominations for Walken and Sheen, for adapted screenplay, and for best picture.

This film released in late 1984,is about a married man named Rob Salinger(the late Dudley Moore) who secretly marries another woman during his current marriage. Rob is a newspaper editor married to Micheline "Micki" Salinger(Ann Reinking),a judge. While secretly romancing Maude(Amy Irving),he proposes to her(Maude). Rob has babies by both women and in one of the last scenes,they(the women) both meet and converse about their respective simultaneous marriages. But Rob keeps both wives. In the real world,bigamy is undoubtedly illegal. Director Blake Edwards' previous film credits include BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S and THE PINK PANTHER. Subsequently,he directed the late John Ritter in 1989's SKIN DEEP

The Hand of Fear is not top-notch, all-time classic Who. Even producer Philip Hinchcliffe doesn't like it very much. The only reason it was likely selected for DVD release over such classics as The Seeds of Doom or Terror of the Autons is probably because it's Sarah Jane's farewell story. Many stories during the Hinchcliffe/Holmes years of Who, sometimes referred to as the "golden age" of Doctor Who, sometimes referred as the "gothic horror period," were based on movies. The Seeds of Doom was based on The Day of the Triffids. Horror of Fang Rock was based on And Then There Were None. If not based on an actual film, many were "inspired" in general by the look and feel of the Hammer horror films. The Hand of Fear was inspired by The Hands of Dr. Orlac, the old horror film about the disembodied hand of a killer. The story starts out great, beginning with a fantastic in-joke. Rock quarries were VERY frequently used in the program as they were easily accessible and somewhat looked like alien planets. Here the Doctor and Sarah land in a rock quarry on earth, and Sarah thinks they're on an alien planet! After an accident with a detonation, Sarah finds Eldrad's hand, and starts saying she/he/it must live a lot. "Eldrad must! live" (high note on "must"). She takes the hand to a nuclear power plant where it can start absorbing energy and regenerating. The story thus far is excellent, and Sarah Jane, possessed by Eldrad, is genuinely creepy, though why she's dressed as Andy Pandy I'll never know. Extremely effective is the scene were the power plant worker disappears with the hand into the core. Also extremely effective is Eldrad eerily searing through the metal door of the power plant's core, and then slowly emerging. The show goes downhill quick once Eldrad, Doctor and co. head to Eldrad's planet. Producer Hinchcliffe said this was a bad shift and that it lacked a certain punch. I agree. For some reason, once Eldrad is back on its home planet the story loses all its edge. Furthermore, Sarah's farewell seems entirely forced. The Hand of Fear, overall, is still good stuff though, and is well worth owning. It is one of the few episodes that contains the cool version of the Tardis interior. (Why they didn't stick with the awesome Jules Verne-ish interior I have no idea!)

This DVD will bring tears to your eyes.  My father was a professional violist for over 40 years and got much pleasure from this video.  My mother enjoys watching this video at least once a week.  It will inspire any young violinst to play with more feeling and overall satisfaction.  Just seeing the old footage of the great masters of long ago is worth your purchase.  If you are a lover of music, you must have this in your collection.

Elvis Fans will love this DVD featuring his latest music, along with many oldies, it is very rare to get up close and personal with this man! Elvis gives 100% of himself on stage!

I bought this DVD because I was getting sick of the other DVD's that claim to be pilates workouts. This pilates work out is very imformative and very beneficial. I am actually seeing results from this workout after only 3 weeks.  Karen also keeps you motivated to continue.  Not to mention the benefit of getting two 50 minute workouts for the price of one. Beware that you need a resist-a-ring for one of the workouts though, and those can be difficult to find. Great, great workout and I would recommend it to anyone

.. with an all-star cast. The plot is not new(Stage Door, How to Marry a Millionaire and Valley of the Dolls to mention but a few), but Judy, Hedy and Lana do an admirable job. Never mind highbrow critcs; Hedy Lamarr wasn`t THAT bad and Lana does one of her best acting jobs ever. Judy is a tomboy and it`s sad that life eventually took her into the direction of Lana`s character Sheila.

The musical numbers are good, but sadly;  footage from THE GREAT ZIEGFELD are edited in(note the finale). James Stewart are good as well - as are Edvard Everett Horton, Charles Winninger and Eve Arden. The film is filled with good 1-liners and there are even echoes of Garbo`s first sound-entrance in ANNA CHRISTIE

David Lean's "The Bridge on the River Kwai" like Jean Renoir's "Grand Illusion" is an anti-heroic war film, set in a prisoner of war camp environment... But there, the point of resemblance came to an end... 

"The Bridge on the River Kwai" is an adventure film in which the nature of World War II is explored... And if in "Grand Illusion" the characters were described by a great artist who treasures their common humanity, in "The Bridge on the River Kwai" they are forced to carry out their destinies by an officer who cannot bear to see his bridge blown up...

Escape is almost impossible from the Japanese camp located near the Kwai River in Burma... The prisoners are badly treated by cruel guards... The camp commander is a rigid psychopath... Conditions are hard to bear... Psychological state of the war British prisoners in constant alteration...

Into the presumptuous situation comes Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness in a fascinating performance), a strict, serene, dedicated British Officer, deeply concerned for the welfare of his men...

Nicholson is under severe pressure from the stubborn Japanese Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) for insisting on his attachment to the Geneva convention and refusing to allow his officers to be used on the construction of the strategic bridge...

Nichilson survives the oppressive punishment imposed on him, but his obsession has risen to near-madness... He agrees to help the Japanese build their bridge, and in his determination to find victory in defeat, he ignores that the bridge, which he insists must be a 'proper bridge,' will serve the Japanese objectives against the British troops...

In addition to the powerful rules of a prison camp picture, captors against captives and an interesting moral respect to a military code, a third element, in the story, is introduced: a small commando team led by Major Warden (Jack Hawkins) and an American sailor (William Holden) whose mission is to destroy the strategic bridge..

The film leads swiftly to a suspenseful climax: a Japanese train and a Commando force directed to a same goal, the Brige of the River Kwai...

Each character, in the motion picture, has a valid reason for what he is doing, and each elaborates a relationship to the bridge revealed to be obsession and insane...

"The Bridge on the River Kwai" hits with 'war' in a compelling logic of events, the indulgence of self-destruction.

With a great visual beauty and terrific whistling tune March, "The Bridge on the River Kwai" is a great dramatic entertainment of the wills of men...

This is the definitive lesbian love story that launched the genre in a new direction.  Out of the dirty bars and masculine flannel shirts, away from the creepy angst of punks.  This wonderful love story brings lesbian love into the light of day with beautiful women, looking and acting sexy, and leading productive, respectable lives.  WHY NOT portray lesbians as beautiful, educated, clean, classy, talented, sober, drug-free, non-violent, non-"self-destructive", straight forward, honest...oh, and truly SEXY??  The Reno landscape in the 50's is a great backdrop for the conflicts that lesbians encountered.  The filming is top notch, the sets and period clothing are spot on.  The musical scores are superb!  
The cast was wonderful!  Charbonneau and Shavers are sensational as total opposites who eventually become drawn and attrated to each other.  Just a masterful duette of performances!  Cay, free and fully out, forward and knowing just what she wants; Vivian, tentative and reluctant to step outside of her cultured and closed box.  Every minute they spend with each other oozes electricity and sexual tension. Two georgeous women making love??  HELLO!  The love scene is landmark.  Audra Lindley is wonderful and perfectly cast as Cay's stepmom.  Cay's best friend, Silver, is absolutely a key role in the dynamics of these chracters; she is the definative support and validation that these women are wonderful people, and deserve love and happiness.  We all need a little "Silver" in our lives!! 
This story is completely intriguing, and HEY, what a wonderful ending!  SEQUEL, SEQUEL!!! This is an absolute must have in any collection.  Timeless tale of the beauty of lesbian love.

I would argue that since we really haven't evolved all that far since our primate days human males still have loads of aggression and animalistic behavior they need to get out. And despite the best efforts from civilization in general to neuter them that aggression still has to go someplace. In Mary Harron's "American Psycho" it comes out in all the wrong places. The film is a character study of one Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), a Wall Street yuppie by day and an ax murderer by night. Patrick is a man who has been forced to the edge because of the fakeness that surrounds him. It's not just the suits and the empty conversations either. It is the peeing contests over who has the best haircut or apartment or business card. He tries to talk about his problems, he really does, but nobody listens to him because nobody listens period. To their ears "Murders and Executions" is interchangeable with "Mergers and Acquisitions." 

The film is a big punch in the face to the egotistical businessmen of the 1980's. This particular Gordon Gekko is overdone and overacted by Christian Bale in a great performance. He is robotic, phony, arrogant and absurd. He is the kind of guy who will have a 3 some with prostitutes just so that he can admire himself in the mirror doing so (all the while flexing his biceps). More than anything he is militantly materialistic. He is Dexter mixed with Jim Profit, only he likes to style and profile while taking an ax to a co-workers head. The whole point, which is made clear in the final scene, is that while these people may truly believe that only the glossy veneer matters it is really the inside that counts. Just because these people make enough cash to swim in, Scrooge McDuck style, doesn't mean that their behavior is excusable. Harron paints the modern businessman as an American Psycho, and it is all too fitting. To make it in the business world your conscious and your soul must be turned off, you must be turned into Patrick Bateman.

The film is a great success. As a horror movie villain Patrick has one of the most compelling backstories ever. Every scene has great energy to it and even though Bale looks a little out of place his acting is so good you can't stop watching him. There is something of a conflict presented when Willem Dafoe shows up to play a detective on the case of one of Patrick's murders. That storyline is interesting while it lasts, but it is never quite wrapped up. I would also admit that after awhile I got a little sick of swimming in these debaucherous waters. He may never tire of having it dirty and bloody but I eventually did. The character is endlessly fascinating (what is up with his love of cheesy 80's music?) and the scene where he kills Paul Allen will leave you stunned and hypnotized. The male need for aggression isn't going anyplace and we need to find a good way to channel it. . .otherwise we are going to have a lot more Patrick Bateman's and Iraq Wars on our hands. ***3/

From 1997 to 2003, Joss Whedon gave his audience some of the best episodes aired on television. BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER showcased an empowered young girl saddled with the unintimidating name of Buffy Summers, who, with the help of her high school friends and her stuffy mentor Giles, faced sundry monsters and saved the world - a lot. Along the way, she managed to leave an indelible impact on our pop cultural consciousness. 

Before its series debut, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, based on its promotional push on TV, seemed slated to be a straight-out horror series starring an erstwhile typical high schooler who battles vampires and demons. But, fairly quickly on, this unassuming little show, thanks to Whedon's intense and witty, pop-culture savvy yet very literate writing, met and surpassed the viewer's expectations. Whedon created compelling stories and characters who grew on the viewers; for seven years, we watched them strive to maintain a normal life as they navigated thru high school, college life, and then to adulthood, all the while frequently facing down supernatural threats. Which brings us to Season 7. 

Possible SPOILERS follow: Here in the bittersweet and melancholy finale season, Joss Whedon attempts to provide closure to the show and also to bring it full circle to its origins. The opening episode "Lessons" has Buffy escorting Dawn, for her inaugural school day, back to good, ol' Sunnydale High, which has just been rebuilt on top of the old one. This, by the way, means that the Hellmouth is very much alive and again active. Somehow, Buffy is offered a job as a school counselor at Sunnydale High by the enigmatic principal, Robin Wood (24's D.B. Woodside). Back in England, Willow, under the tutelage of Giles and a benevolent coven of witches, has been recovering from her turn to the dark side (Season Six) and receives a horrifying glimpse of the future for Sunnydale. Meanwhile, Spike is found dwelling in the Sunnydale High School basement in a bonkers state of mind, influenced by his new soul and possibly also by...something else. Lessee, who's left? Anya is again a Vengeance Demon, though her heart isn't really in it. And Xander is still fixing windows...

The season's major story arc involves the return of the First Evil, the original and the source of all evil. The First's return is made possible by the instability caused by Buffy's having died and consequently being resurrected (again, Season 6). Very early on, we get a hint of the season's Big Bad as various Sunnydale denizens spout the ominous warning: "From beneath you, it devours." This season also increases the scope of Buffy's world even more as most of the Watcher Council are annihilated and Giles is forced to seek out Potential Slayers (who are also being killed off one by one by Bringers, no-eyed, murdering servants of Caleb and the First) and bring them to Sunnydale for protection. Now, more than ever, Buffy's leadership skills and methods are tested and even questioned as several of the Potentials prove to be uncowed and contentious free thinkers. Buffy has never been forced to deliver as many bracing, rallying speeches as she has been this season, which attests to her foe's overwhelming level of menace. 

Because the First cannot enter our world in a corporeal form and can only assume the identities of dead people, this is an opportunity for a callback of Buffy's past uber-foes. For one last time, we get to enjoy cameos of the Master, Drusilla, the Mayor, Adam, Glory, and two of the Nerd Trio. Pretty neat. Besides the First, Buffy faces two despicable and truly hard-to-kill villains, who are themselves minions of the First: the Turok-Han, an early caveman type of vampire (thus, even more sturdy than contemporary vampires) and Caleb, the frightening, mysoginistic preacher who convincingly beats Buffy senseless in several encounters. 

As ever, the writers do an amazing job. The episodes are obviously action-packed. But, underneath the surface, the show is laden with metaphors and symbolisms. Themes of isolation, the isolation of a leader, female empowerment, sacrifice, friendship, and humanity are touched on in great depth. This season is also about the quest for redemption. Most of the members of Buffy's Scooby gang, ironically, at one point or another, were evil or have turned evil in the past: Willow, Spike, Anya, Faith, Andrew...All these characters are trying to find their way back to atonement; it won't be easy. 

This season has to be the one with the most recurring characters in it. Principal Wood and the Potentials are introduced. Season 7 also marks the return of Andrew, Faith, and, in one episode, Angel. With the glut of additional characters, the core Scoobies are given short thrift here, although Dawn does shine in "Potential" and Xander proves his worth in "Potential" and "Dirty Girls." One episode, "Selfless," really focuses on Anya and paves the way for her eventual return to the fold. Only Spike seems to maintain copious screen time throughout the series. The camera, of course, is ever on Buffy Summers.

The arrival of the Potentials does usher in a freshness to the series as it simultaneously takes the spotlight away from the Scoobies. The take-charge Kennedy (Iyari Limon), the feisty Rona (Indigo), and Amanda (Sarah Hagan) prove to be welcome additions to the cast, while the non-English speaking Asian Potential drops some instant funnies. "Conversations with Dead People" reintroduces Andrew (the very good, very funny Tom Lenk) as a possible good guy, while "Dirty Girls" marks the welcome return of sexy Faith (Eliza Dushku) as her encounters with Spike provide some of the high points of the season. The awesome Nathan Fillion, by the way, is scary good as Caleb.

The Special Features provide episode commentaries by various cast and crew members on "Lessons," "Selfless," "Conversations with Dead People," "The Killer In Me," "Lies My Parents Told Me," "Dirty Girls," and "Chosen." Disc 3 has the featurette "It's Always Been About the Fans." Disc 6 offers up four more featurettes (the 36-minute long "Season 7 Overview - Buffy: Full Circle"; "Buffy 101- Studying the Slayer" - various television critics talk about the show's influence; "Generation S" - interviews with the Potentials actresses; "The Last Sundown" - a look at Joss Whedon's top 10 favorite Buffy episodes and some of his thoughts about the series); an outtakes reel (not that funny); "Buffy Wraps" (the wrap party with cast and crew, but where was Sarah Michelle Gellar?); and for those who care, a DVD-ROM Willow Demon Guide.

Years ago, Joss Whedon wanted to shake things up by turning topsy-turvy the cliche of the hapless, little blonde damsel needing a hero to come to her rescue. Seven years of quality television has proven that audiences will accept a tiny girl being capable of slaying monsters while remaining quintessentially feminine. So, above all else, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER is meant to be a feminist allegory. But, for those who aren't into that, there's still so much that this season has to offer: an us against the world mentality, superlative action sequences, shivery horror/fantasy elements, witty repartees, heartfelt dialogue, gripping, dramatic stories, and great acting. And, of course, great, iconic heroes in Buffy Summers, Spike, Faith, and crew. Five stars for one of my all-time favorite shows EVER.

Oh, yeah, and I like the slim set collection.

First let me start off by saying this. Ken Sushi Volume 1 is unquestionably the BEST video guide for making sushi. I have had a chance to see the other guides, and quite frankly they just don't cut it. Poor camera work, and even worse instruction should not be found in a sushi instructional video (or any culinary instructional video for that matter). Also, being taught by a sushi enthusiast rather than a professional sushi chef is not going to send a very good message to people who are really serious about learning how to make sushi properly (people want to learn from someone experienced, not enthusiastic).

Finally we have a video that is taught by a professional in the sushi scene, and he really takes the time to lay out all the techniques he's developed over the years, so that with a little practice (and the benefit of not having to take the time Ken did to trial and error his methods of perfect sushi creation) I was actually able to make some really great sushi.

The camera work is GREAT! No shakes or stutters, I didn't find myself distracted by the nuances of poor production quality. Truthfully this video is done so well, you will just find yourself immersed in what Ken is teaching (it plays a LOT like a chef Martin Yan instructional video).

Also it seems a lot of time was taken in pre production to really focus the instruction to a degree that it is thorough enough for someone familiar with sushi creation, yet developed enough so that someone completely new to the sushi experience can actually have a fair shot to making a wholesome, delicious dish.

If you take the time to watch the video a few times, and practice along with it. You WILL make sushi good enough to eat, and present to your friends, family (just utterly show off).

I'm just really glad I can finally say there is now a sushi instructional video that I feel was worth every penny of my purchase. If you want to really learn how to make sushi well, then Ken Sushi Volume 1 will be your number one resource. The only negative thing I have to say is where the heck is volume two????

This live DVD was released as a companion to Randy Travis' "Worship & Faith" CD.  The concert was recorded on July 15, 2003 at Calvary Assmebly God Church in Orlando, Florida.  Here, Travis delivers many of the songs from the W&F album, plus "Pray for the Fish" and his country radio hit "Three Wooden Crosses."  Comments from Travis and from several fans are added in between songs.  Like its audio companion, this DVD contains a great mix of classic hymns, camp meeting songs and contemporary worship songs.  Some of the highlights include "You Are Worthy of My Praise," "Just a Closer Walk with Thee," "We Fall Down" and "Open the Eyes of My Heart."  Other noteworthy tracks include "Shall We Gather at the River," "Peace in the Valley," "Above All" and "Love Lifted Me."  Travis closes the show with "Three Wooden Crosses," the first song recorded on a Christian music label to ever top the country music charts.  "Worship & Faith" is a great DVD for lovers of worship music, lovers of country music, as well as for any and every Randy Travis fan.  This is an excellent DVD

I became a Robson Green fan when I saw the first season of Wire in the Blood.  Since then, I have read the books, and watched Green in his other crime series, Touching Evil.  If you like to watch films about police solving serial killer crimes, you will enjoy this.  The crimes are shocking, the denouement is interesting, and at the heart of the story is the developing relationship between Dr. Tony Hill (Green) and the police woman with whom he works these crimes

Much of the plot has been outlined above, as well as the cast and I am, in large part, in complete agreement with the positive reveiws recorded.

I want to add that, for anyone raised on the old Universal horror pictures, or the films directed by James Whale or Val Lewton, where the suspense is the important part of the film; this picture, Shadows and Fog, has this quality absolutely dripping from every frame! Despite the comedic elements (and there are many funny things happening) the tension rises perceptibly throughout the narrative. The climax is dissapointing for many, but if you follow the subtext of this extremely philosophical script it is nearly a perfect resolution in all ways.

I have had philosophy students who were struggling with concepts of 19th and 20th century writers watch this movie and instantly gain insight into the point of the often times obtuse & oblique writings of Hegel, Kant and the like. I beleive that the unpopularity of the this film is based on people thinking that they were about to see Bananas or Sleeper.

Love him or hate him, you have to admit, Woody Allen is DEEP. 

A personal favorite film of mine, but definetly not everybodies cup of philosophicallly comedic tea

This DVD is great, heck, it has the Nickel on the cover! Anyways, this DVD has a bonus feature of Mac's amazing three point flurry vs. San Antonio earlier this season - in its entirety, they used the TNT broadcast. A must have just for that alone!

It also has Franchise's game winner during opening night, Fisher's 0.4 shot, Wade's heroics, and of course the classic endings, like Rik Smit's buzzer beater vs. the Magic in 1995, Larry Bird's game-winners, and can't forget about the best one of them all, MJ's final shot in 1998. Another bonus feature is all of the recent buzzer beaters from Horry, Carter, Iverson, and Marbury

This is a terrific tour of Hawaii.  The photography is incredible and it shows Hawaii's breathtaking scenery including beautiful beaches on Oahu and Maui, Mt. Haleakala and Waimea Canyon.  The music's great and the narration includes lots of travel tips as you're completely immersed in a Hawaiian vacation - volcanoes, exciting nightlife, surfing, scuba dives and hulas that "were so alluring that the missionaries banned them".  The only person who would not like this DVD simply doesn't want to unwind and relax during this fascinating travel guide.  After you see this you'll want to explore this paradise yourself and this DVD will help you plan your trip or your honeymoon

Like many that have seen this movie, I have been a fan of the video game series for years, and this movie never disappoints me. It has everything that makes RE great; strong characters, interesting story and scenes that make me jump. At first, it is sad that no video game characters make it on to this movie, but Milla Jovovich is great as the heroine Alice. 

The special effects were really good for this movie. The licker and the dogs were really impressive. The action is also very entertaining. When the action is happening, I find myself not being able to turn away, it is very fast paced. I also really enjoyed the scene when the security lasers were slicing up the team. The Red Queen was an interesing villain as well, maybe even more so than the licker. Overall, this movie is way worth seeing and having if you are a fan or even if you aren't a fan of the games. The movie is just fun

I was just surfing the shelves at Borders today when I stumbled over Queen Kelly on DVD!  I couldn't believe it. I have just been getting interested in silent films (I'm 18) and of course I'm a Gloria Swanson fan (who isn't?), having seen her brilliant performance in Sunset Blvd. Anyway, I had always heard rumors about Queen Kelly - the incomplete, forgotten masterpiece. I had to pay a whopping [money] for this DVD, but it is definitely a piece of art and worth every penny.    First of all, this film is old. You can hear it creak and moan at times and the orchestra soundtrack has not aged well - let's just say the music is annoyingly intense. But the age of the film just makes it more haunting to watch. The story takes place in the 20s, but you could almost believe it was hundreds of years ago.    Now I want to concentrate on the story and the performances. Gloria Swanson's performance in Queen Kelly has to be one of her best - she was every bit as good in this film as in Sunset Blvd. We can easily see why she was such a huge silent star - her emotions and beauty carry the film just as much as the fascinating story.     This was really melodrama at its best. People tend to forget, I think, that melodrama can be an art form, stressing wistful idealism and instead of cynical realism!  The main event here is the story - wow! It's tragic that the film (and the story) were never finished. But who knows? It's just begging for a megabucks remake with Nicole Kidman. Now that the musicals are back, maybe silents will be next

Truly his greatest film I have seen thus far.  Not only is one taken in by this movie, but it allows one to forget that it's filmed in black and white.  The boy, Elvis, of course, is even more beautiful in KING CREOLE.  Which leads me to believe he believed in his work for this picture.  The soundtrack is admirable.  He delivered it with such effervescence, such pride.  One can't help but fall in love with him and this movie. 
Too bad Elvis was so loyal to Col. Parker.  He could have been the great dramatic actor he had always wanted to be.  This film certainly promised it

I am from India,and Megadeth is one of the few metal bands with a huge following here.From the few bootlegs of live shows that I did manage to get hold of,this seems to be one of the best gigs ever.Mustaine's singing is as good as it gets live ( if you think it is bad,then you have'nt heard him elsewhere ).But such minor foibles aside,the gig is f'in awesome.The setlist is almost perfect.The biggest pro is that most songs have been improvised.I love that.I used to hate the fact that Megadeth played CD perfect versions of their tracks,which was not fun.I'd rather listen to the CD with better production and singing.But here,they have really streched quiet a bit and given the audience,a stellar musical show.Jimmy De Grasso ( tho' he looks a bit nervous in my opinion ) is unbelievaly tight.He looks like he is appearing for a test,when he's playing the solo on she wolf ( you can see the tension on his face),but wotta solo....the sticks alsmost blur out.The sound and picture quality is great too.My only grouse is that the band has almost no audience interaction and there's very lil bonus stuff on the CD....some soundchecks or pre gig preparations thrown in would have rocked...they need to learn a thing or two from the 'tallica guys about this.But that apart...brilliant gig...a must for any metalhead

We all feel alone at times... this is something 'lost in translation' brilliantly shows its audience.. Indeed loneliness often, paradoxically, occurs in highly populated areas.. It is as if the more people we are surrounded by the more alienated we feel - the more our differences stand out... Bill Murray is superbly cast as the outsider celebrity guy, who dosen't seem to quite know why he is where he is, and why he is treated the way he is - in a culture and a pace of life so distant from his way of seeing and experiencing reality.. This is a very promosing feature from sofia coppola.. It captures hotel life in a way that only direct experiene could top.. This also sort of represents the zenith of Bill murray's career and perhaps his best performance to date.

&quot;Above Suspicion&quot; offers both a plausible plot and realistic character portrayals. The dilemma of the story becomes apparent when a family man's (Bakula's) past comes back to haunt him, consequently tearing his life and his family apart. His wife (Sciorra) becomes more and more unsure of her husband as the story progresses. &quot;Above Suspicion&quot; has the qualities of an intense psychological thriller, as well as a heart warmer. It's a must see for almost any movie fan. Just don't confuse this &quot;Above Suspicion&quot; with the film starring Christopher Reve

Collateral Damage is the great and partially real action film in which  Arnold Schwarzenger plays a fireman hell bent on getting his hands on the Terrorist who killed his wife and kid and many other citizens near a shopping mall. 

With the attacks on Sept 11 , movies have tried to cash in but Collateral Damage is different. Arnold even dedicated the movie to firefighters everywhere in an interview  with Byron Allen. 


The movie is brilliant in showing what only what the motivation behind terrorist attacks , but the depiction of slow agencies like fbi to counter these terrorist attacks. 

Basically, the FBI and CIA tell Gorden Brewer(Arnold Schwarzennger) that they are working to bring down the terrorist who killed his family, when in fact they  have no good leads on the suspect. 

Rather, than sitting on his butt, and waiting for the FBI to do something, Gordon takes the law into his own hands and seeks to get justice for his family  by going into Columbia and getting ''The Wolf''(Cliff Curtis) as the terrorist is called. 

There is a great scene in which Gordon goes crazy and literally beats the hell out of a cold-blooded radio news reporter who says that the victims are pure garbage by saying their ''collateral damage''. The radio reporter explains the reasons behind terrorist attacks but shows no feeling for victims. I loved this scene, because this reporter clearly has no remorse for the dead. He probably has no family of his own, and doesn't know the meaning of life, except to cover his own. 

Now you might say to yourself what's the difference between Arnold's character (who is going for justice) and the terrorist well here is the big difference from  Arnold himself: ''The difference between me and you is that I am only going to kill you''. 

Unbelievable action and twists at the end, that you're literally be on the edge of youre seat, and just when you think the movie is over.... it's  not !!! 

Director Andrew Davis not only gives a fact type based movie based on Columbia, but also a factual based type movie that deals with Terrorism and the lessons that we must learn to see that things like this don't happen again. 
In fact, most people will remember the horrible case of Wall Street Reporter , Daniel Pearl, who was executed after the U.S. failed to meet the demands of the Middle East terrorist holding. 

The U.S. should have gone after these terrorists like the way Arnold does in this movie. but then the U.S. does not have a great track record when it comes to nailing terrorist even going back to the 1970's the U.S. supported and backed up
madmen like General Pinochet in Chile and dictator Samoza in Nicaragua. Both of them killed hundreds of people with U.S. backing and funding.

Still though ''Collateral Damage'' is a great action film that you must see.

This DVD is way cool with a buch of sport themed episodes. First Scooby and the gang help a baseball hero break a home run record, but the ghost of Cab Crag isn't too happy about having his record broken.  Then they compete in a off road race with a giant worm as a competitor - and what's with the worm worshipers -I mean they go like whoo "a giant worm is our god, whoo we hate cars".   Then they go to the Bocephus wrestling facility.  Could they come up with a better name than Bocephus?  There's a really freaky creature which may scare your little sister.  The last episode is, by far, the best.  A hockey ghost is terrorizing the World Cup Hockey event. He's one of the toughest ghosts ever, either that, or the Russian Police are the biggest whimps ever!  I think this DVD is a good buy if you are a Scooby fan, just be prepared, it can get a little goofy.

"The Petrified Forest" is a filmed version of the 1935 Broadway smash.  The play starred Leslie Howard and Humphrey Bogart and their stage performances were preserved when Warner Brothers bought the play to the screen in late 1935.  The addition of  Bette Davis made good box office sense as she was beginning to hit her stride and was reteamed with Howard after their earlier matching in "Of Human Bondage".

The film is set in the Arizona desert. A killer on the run holds up in a road house taking hostage a group of people there.  The play has a few things to say about "the meaning of life" with the juxtaposition of outcast wanderer and intellectual Alan Squier played by Leslie Howard and vicious gangster Duke Mantee played by Humphrey Bogart. The morality is fairly corny now and most of it is contained in the dialogue of Leslie Howard but he delivers it superbly so it still has some resonance. The film was a breakthrough for Bogart but his performance is too theatrical for my liking. Davis is a revelation acting with a simplicity and freshness which is almost unique in her career.  She is also very well photographed by Sol Polito and her big eyes glow. 

The DVD print is excellent and a lot of extras are included, including an expert and very detailed commentary about the film, a terrible Vitaphone short with the absurd Toby Wing and a funny cartoon about the Cocoanut Grove.  The radio performance included is almost unintelligible with a very poor Tyrone Power in Howard's role.

The DVD is excellent value especially if it is purchased as part of the Warners Gangster Collection.

I think a lot of people miss the power of this movie.  To me this is a scathing view of how simple minded religious people are duped by Ministries in this country.  Even though this was made some years ago before the advent of the infamous TV Ministries today, the message is still clear.  Those who have only a simplistic relgious outlook are prey for the kind of charletans portrayed in this movie.  

This is certainly one of Burt Lancaster's better roles, and he plays it with much guesto! If we were to look at most of the popular Ministers today we would find that many are from this dark kind of background.  This movie has a strong message.  Don't listen to the word of God from others.  If you must believe in the wild stories of the Bible, do so in your own way.  Do not sanction phoney churches and preachers with your time and money! Even in this modern day and age, the influence of this kind of hokem is still strong.  Mr. Bush and the Republican Party used it as a means to seek re-election!  

Everyone who is a born again Christian, or a church goer of any kind should see this movie and perhaps get a better understanding of what the religious industry is in this country.  The ending of the film is perhaps a bit contrived, meant to imply the dangers of man assuming the powers of the Almighty (if there is one).  Still, a powerful film for its time and contains a worthwhile message for viewers today.

The show is absolutely GREAT! Blue Falcon is another Space Ghost and Dynomut is the futuristic version of Scooby Doo. Dim witted and loveable. Getting the complete show is great and the shows from these HB vaults are all looking pretty good with bright and vivid colors (amid some nasty scratches and dust, but it WAS cheap animation folks). As a Scooby fan this is a MUST own! I quite enjoy the Blue Falcon/Dynomut show also. 

5 stars for the show.

The set however nice still drops the ball, you get two single sided dvds and two flippers. The problem with this is that the dvds are all on top of each other with maybe a 1/16th of an inch between them both. I know this was to cut down on costs but it makes the two flipper discs quite hard to get out without scratching them or marking them up with a good fingerprint smear. But then again if it was a perfect world we couldn't complain.

All in all a solid set!

4 1/2 out of 5

I thought the video was well done.  It was good to feature the clinching
games of the Division and League Championship Series plus all four games
of the World Sries.  I think they should have included at least the high- lights on a extra disk of Games 1 and 2 of the Division Series against
Boston and Games 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the League Championship Series against
Los Angeles.  Still, I highly recommend this collection for all gung-ho
White Sox fans who cherish the memory of the most exciting season in 88
years.  A great viewing companion for those cold winter nights

Absolutely riveting performance by Noah Taylor as the thirty-year old Adlof Hitler.  The story is very uneven, however, but Taylor is perfect and brings the film up to a must-see five stars.  You are there.

This movie is a reallllllllllllly scary movie.  The only part I didn't like was that pervert Mikks in the beginning. Be warned of grossness. That is all I need to say

She really brings a character to life.  And this short series of British comedy was really enjoyable
