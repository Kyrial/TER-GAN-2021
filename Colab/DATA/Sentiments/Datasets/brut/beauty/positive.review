I bought the Shampoo Theory and Condition Theory and this Redo Freshen-Up Mist. I have normal-type hair that needs to be washed every other day -- and if I use a lot of product, it needs to be washed every day. I have very sensitive skin too. This mist worked very well on my hair, definitely freshened it up and allowed me to restyle it with a quick blow dry. And it feels awesome on my skin. Well done, Jonathan

If Jonathan wants to sell environmentally concious products he should promote it in his other hairstyling products. The aquasana shower filter  is an excellent product which i use .Whats it matter who's name is on it. It is what it is and it will leave your skin and hair feeling fresher.

Well first off, I'm a guy with very short hair...so I don't know whether or not it really works. But I'm bored and decided to rate it anyway. So here goes:

Cons

Conditioner is really thick and difficult to get out of the bottle. The best solution for this is to let the bottle sit upside down. 

Pros

Smells DAMN good. I'm not a big fan of fruity/coconut aromas, but I like this particular smell so much that I might need to go to rehab sometime in the future. 


Bottom Line: Although this conditioner is difficult to get out of the bottle, it smells really good. Whether or not it will work for your hair, the only way to know is to try it. And even if ot doesn't work for your hair...it's worth the 20 bucks just to open it up and smell it every now and then. =)

This is absolutely the greatest shampoo ever! I've been abusing my hair for at least 30 years, and I have never had my hair looking and feeling as healthy as it does now. There is no better product for your hair on the market. All others are full of damaging detergents and chemicals with a dose of silicone thrown in to make you think your hair is clean, but you're killing it. I admire Jonathan for not treating us like idiots by being THE ONLY shampoo that doesn't tell you to lather, shampoo, and rinse twice, but you do need to. And you need to use no more than a dime-size amount of the Jonathan conditioner. My hair has never looked or felt so good

It's the best product I've used to create volume and hold.  I didn't notice it after blow drying, but, while using the curling iron and styling - my hair had a lot more volume and great hold.  I have straight, fine, limp hair and it is very difficult to get it to hold a style.  I truely noticed a big difference.  I plan to purchase the other volumizing products, once they are in stock.

I used this product this morning for the first time.  I washed my hair, blew it dry, most of the way, then rubbed the product in my hands and lightly distributed it throughout my hair.  The best way for me to describe it, is that, it is like a creamy hairspray.  Yes, it is tacky, like hairspray can be, but that's how it helps you get the style you want.  What I like about how it works on my hair, is that it really tamed the frizzes and brought down the "big" hair look that I usually have after blowing my thick hair dry.  I think it would also work well on the days that I blow my hair out.  I would probably blow it out first, then apply some dirt to help tame and smooth it.  I can see where it might make thinner, straighter hair a bit limp, so be careful not to use very much.

Edit:  I think it is best to apply to slightly damp hair, that might help with the people that are having trouble applying it to completely dry hair

I have been reading about this miracle hair dryer for months in the beauty magazines I read, so I will admit I was very excited to pruchase it. The results however will amaze even the most cynical consumer. My hair has never looked so good when styled at home. True, it looks about the same as what my hairstylist does, but to me that is well worth the moderately high price tag. It was a good buy for me because I spend a lot of money buying a variety of cremes and glosses to make my hair pretty, and now I know it wasn't the products I put in that made my hair look bad, it was the dryer.I was so surprised to notice that even the ends of my hair were shiny, and my ends are sooo fried. The difference is astounding. 

I bought this dryer in a package with the babyliss straightener, and I would definately recommend that to anyone wanting to buy this dryer. For the same price you can get a free straightener. (A very good one!)

Its good for waking up, because once you put it on you feel refreshed because your lips feel on fire.I like the sting and  the shine of it. It finishes pretty fast and the roll ball may feel like a little drag to keep rolling on the lips, but i think it's worth trying it unless you have extreme sensitive lips, this stuff is strong. Did i mention the great smell? Yum! Me and my boyfriend loved it.

I just got this item (from ebay, it's cheaper)and feel it's worthy of praise.  I have thick, straight hair, and bought this product to wave my hair.  I haven't figured out how it curls, but to wave it's incredibly easy!  Grab your hair from the root and twist outward and it waves nice and fast w/o burning your hair like a curling iron would.  Also w/ a curling iron, it's difficult to wave the top close to the roots.   It heats fast!  and comes w/ a nice pouch so that you can put it away before it cools.

I had the Chi Turbo (1"), but I got worried after reading some reviews about it being unreliable.  So part of the reason I wanted to buy the T3 iron was that it comes with a 4-YEAR comprehensive warranty.  The other difference is that the solid-ceramic plates are "infused" with tourmaline which I found intriguing.

1-3/8" wide plates are the perfect width for my long-ish hair.  (I've used a 2 inch wide iron, which I found harder to maneuver.)  It heats up fast, and stays hot.  It does a great job gripping the hair without snagging.  My hair stays silky and straight all day, and does not feel damaged after a while, like it did with cheaper irons I've used in the past.

Another thing that this iron does that other irons do not do as well - it really curls.  It has heat vents along the sides of the plates that lets you curl your hair by twisting it near the root and pulling it through (different from the usual method of gripping the ends of the strands and then winding up).  It creates a springy curl better than any flat iron I've used.  (However, the heating vents make the exterior of the iron hotter to the touch.  So there is a drawback to this function.)

Overall, I enjoy using this flat iron.  Very happy with this purchase.

ETA: I've learned that HairArt will not honor the warranty unless you buy it from an authorized distributor (e.g., Sephora). So you might want to check that before you place your order

After watching Blow Out and seeing how passionate Jonathan was about his product, he sold me. Anyone who is that determined to make the best product on the market, obviously will do whatever it takes to make it happen.
After seeing how much the product was, I cringed at the fact that a bottle of shampoo would be that much. I later, literally dragged myself to Sephora to purchase this shampoo/conditioner after knowing that I was willing to take a risk that could eventually end up in my closet.
I bought it, went straight to my bathroom, and washed my hair. The shampoo did not lather, which I expected considering there is no harsh detergents or sodium lauryl sulfate. The conditioner was a very light, thin substance. Definitely not thick. 
Finale-Dried my hair, and right there, I knew that this product is definitely the BEST hair product BY FAR, that I have ever used. My hair, is very damaged, brittle and FULL of split ends. This product made my hair, very very full, FULL of shine, and very soft. My hair was beautiful for days....
Last test.. going to work. As soon as I put my hair down from a pony tail (I'm a waitress), INSTANTLY everyone noticed my hair. They asked "what did you do?? your hair is soo beautiful".. I told them "40 dollar shampoo and conditioner" WELL WORTH THE COST. Definitely a salon in a bottle. Now my worst fear is that it will be discontinued for any reason. And if so, I am willing spend 1k to stock up and save as much as I can. There is no other product like it

After reading the other reviews I was a little worried about using the product I had already ordered.  After using it for a few days now my hair has never looked better, I truly feel like this shampoo/conditioner was meant for me.  I have fine, super straight hair, middle to short.  It feels clean and sleek. The conditioner smells like pina coloda, yum!  I would definatly recommend this for my hair type.  Would maybe recommend to lather the shampoo in your hands first then work thoroughly( it doesn't lather as well as some shampoos that have lots of glycerine in them) and only apply the conditioner towards the end of your hair and leave in for a few min.  Hope that helps

I thought I was just going to have to put up with fly-away hair the rest of my life.  This product is not for baby fine hair that goes limp when anything touches it.  It's serious taming for seriously stubborn, coarse, or frizzy hair.  Mine falls into the first two categories.  Don't use too much!  I use it after I've dried some of the moisture out with light blow drying then gently sweep it through my hair - even combing it gently in to reach every strand.  For the first time in years my razor-cut layered hair is smooth

LIKE ANY OTHER LEAVE-in creme, conditioner, ANYTHING, if you PUT TOO MUCH OF IT ON, it WILL attract  DIRT.  I know this because I have baby fine hair and had to model in the DRY DRY deserts in the middle of summer.  Needed ANYTHING leave-in to keep my staticy hair down.  Yes, the more you use, to more dirty you get....  (but in photos you can't really see this, but it felt nasty!)    SO.  Wash your hair.   Well.  Condition.  Towel dry.  APPLY SPARINGLY.  Like a TOUCH.  And smooth into hair. It's not rocket science.  If you need a little more later, add a little more

High Beam is a nice subtle highlighter. However, be sure to blend it very quickly and well or it will look unnatural in certain lighting (it'll look like you have pink nail polish on your face). It also has a tendency to emphasize pores. So only use it on areas of your face where you don't have any, like on the top of the cheek bone and under your eyebrows.

This dry iron is absolutely amazing, I really can't say enough about it. Great for ALL TYPES of hair! It heats up in just seconds and what would take almost 2hrs to blow dry my hair now takes less than half the time. Plus your hair comes out extremely straight. Highly recommend to anyone who wants their hair to look great but doesnt have the time or energy to sit in a hair salon for hours. It is an investment in your hair, one of the better ones I've made.

I don't know what the complaints about this product are.  It seems that people are trying to use it for extreme hold hairstyles.  This is not the purpose of this product.  I use it for my short haircut to make the ends stay spiky and styled out, and it works WONDERFULLY.  No matter how much you move your head, it stays in place, but somehow moves enough to keep you from having a stiff look.  And, when you brush your hair out at the end of the day, it feels like you never put it in.  Hair stays soft and feels clean.  The reason why this gel is thinner is that it isn't as sticky or goopey in your hair as other gels.  And it spreads out easier

I purchased a Beauty Water Shower Purification System and have used it about 5 times now with fantastic results. I have very hard water in my home and am tired of constantly having to blow dry my hair or having to use tons of products for it to be manageable and not frizzy.  My hair felt very soft and manageable using this product and I am hoping it helps my highlights last longer.  I did not experience that 'slimy' feeling people usually associate with soft water.  I'm even able to let my hair air dry and not be frizzy with this product.  I am curious to see how long this filter lasts.  I called Jonathan Products and was told that they do have a replacement filter that costs $55 so you can save a bit of money when you need to replace the filter

I watched Blow Out and figured the product was flying off the shelves because of the show's popularity.  I ordered some because the ingredients sounded nice, plus he did seem sincere when formulating, etc.  I have blonde hair, color treated, thick, long lengths.  I've bought high-end hair products for 20 yrs from beauty salons and stores and have never used anything that made my hair feel like Jonathan Product.  You can immediately tell it's stripping and cleansing your hair.  Then, the conditioner,  with it's exotic fragrance,  is the most wonderful conditioning treatment I've ever used.  My hair looks cleaner and has more body than ever before with just shampoo & conditioner.  I'll use it as long as it's available to me

I absolutely love this hairbrush! I have curly hair and like to blow it out often and until now I have not been impressed with any brushes. This brush holds the hair in pace when blowing dry and also lets you move it with your hair and dose not hurt as some can or get stuck. You will not be sorry if you are looking for the perfect brush to go with your perfect dryer (the featherweight)! Oh another thing I like is it extremely easy to keep clean.

Its good for waking up, because once you put it on you feel refreshed because your lips feel on fire.I like the sting and  the shine of it. It finishes pretty fast and the roll ball may feel like a little drag to keep rolling on the lips, but i think it's worth trying it unless you have extreme sensitive lips, this stuff is strong. Did i mention the great smell? Yum! Me and my boyfriend loved it.

As a lip gloss addict, I have easily over 200+ glosses. Too Faced Fat Kiss is by far one of my favorites. The superb shine makes my lips look so good! Although it doesn't really plump, it still tastes like cinnamon, and it will warm you up in winter. I have two different colors, because I like it so much! I strongly reccomend getting a couple, so you can keep them in your purse, make up bag, car...Everywhere! This rocks sooo much

Well I am very impressed with this.  I also have tried so many different shampoos and this is one of the best, if not the best, I've used.  I say that because whether I straighten my hair or leave it curly, this shampoo makes it feel and look and smell great.  It feels so nice and clean.  I don't rinse twice with this because it's unnessesary.  
I tried this because of watching Blow Out and on my last trip to America I bought a couple of bottles.  It's one of the best purchases I made.  Most girls buy shampoos etc based on packaging and smell and let me tell you, not only does it look and smell great, but what it does for your hair is amazing and apparently it's very low in damaging chemicals.  I won't hesitate to buy more of Jonathan's products next time I go.  I love this and can't say enough about it

This is the second product of Jonathan's I've used and I'm equally happy with it.  I have thin hair when it's straight, and something in the middle when it's curly.  Either way, I'd like it thicker, and this foam certainly helps.  It's great and I've found it does what it promises.  It smells good and you don't need to use too much.  It feels nice in my hair and the fragrance lasts most of the day.  It doesn't matter if your hair is curly or straight, hopefully you will find this as effective and as helpful as I have

I just got this item (from ebay, it's cheaper)and feel it's worthy of praise.  I have thick, straight hair, and bought this product to wave my hair.  I haven't figured out how it curls, but to wave it's incredibly easy!  Grab your hair from the root and twist outward and it waves nice and fast w/o burning your hair like a curling iron would.  Also w/ a curling iron, it's difficult to wave the top close to the roots.   It heats fast!  and comes w/ a nice pouch so that you can put it away before it cools.

I had the Chi Turbo (1"), but I got worried after reading some reviews about it being unreliable.  So part of the reason I wanted to buy the T3 iron was that it comes with a 4-YEAR comprehensive warranty.  The other difference is that the solid-ceramic plates are "infused" with tourmaline which I found intriguing.

1-3/8" wide plates are the perfect width for my long-ish hair.  (I've used a 2 inch wide iron, which I found harder to maneuver.)  It heats up fast, and stays hot.  It does a great job gripping the hair without snagging.  My hair stays silky and straight all day, and does not feel damaged after a while, like it did with cheaper irons I've used in the past.

Another thing that this iron does that other irons do not do as well - it really curls.  It has heat vents along the sides of the plates that lets you curl your hair by twisting it near the root and pulling it through (different from the usual method of gripping the ends of the strands and then winding up).  It creates a springy curl better than any flat iron I've used.  (However, the heating vents make the exterior of the iron hotter to the touch.  So there is a drawback to this function.)

Overall, I enjoy using this flat iron.  Very happy with this purchase.

ETA: I've learned that HairArt will not honor the warranty unless you buy it from an authorized distributor (e.g., Sephora). So you might want to check that before you place your order

I have been using the volumizing shampoo and conditioner for 2 weeks.  I love this product!  No build up, No dandruf.  Make sure your hair is wet, not just damp, and you should not have a "lathering problem".  I purchased this from QVC and I will definately be a repeat customer.  I have short hair, so this will last me a while.  I loved it so much I bought some for my daughter.  This is my new shampoo

I love the Benefit line, everything I have tried works great (not to mention they have great packaging and catchy names for all their products!). 

That said, High Beam is simply amazing. It only takes a little dab to add a nice glow/shimmer to my face. I especially like to use it on the cheek bones as it leaves a nice soft glow. High Beam works so much better for me than other products I've tried that either left my skin sticky or chalky. Not to mention those other products cost a lot more!

If you are looking for a little glow, a little shimmer, High Beam is the answer

I recently discovered Benefit products. This is a great product if you want to add a little glow to your skin. I use it to highlight my cheek bones. You can use it any where you want a glance to linger. The best thing about this product is the smallest amount makes a big difference in your skin. I suggest you try this product. It works wonders.

This dry iron is absolutely amazing, I really can't say enough about it. Great for ALL TYPES of hair! It heats up in just seconds and what would take almost 2hrs to blow dry my hair now takes less than half the time. Plus your hair comes out extremely straight. Highly recommend to anyone who wants their hair to look great but doesnt have the time or energy to sit in a hair salon for hours. It is an investment in your hair, one of the better ones I've made.

I am a big fan of this product.  My hair is very strong.  It needs a product which can keep it tamed.  However, most products that have that level of strength also come with high sheen or gloss which, in my opinion, is a bad look for today's fashions.  The matte look is more flexible.  American Crew Fiber gives me pliability and a matte look with a very strong hold.  It also smells nice.... not to strong and not too girly

I have been using this product for over 5 years as an alternative to gel or bed head.  The results are great. No unwated shine, no gooiness, very easy to wash off. 
Your hair wont feel stiff and wont get damaged. Reasonably priced and more available every day.

This is a great product for getting the bed head look.  I can use approximately a dime size worth in my palms and go wild!  Trust me, the results are great.  If you apply too much, you're hair will get oily. The good thing is that this product washes out easily with any Shampoo

This stuff is great.  I used to buy new gels, pommades, pastes, etc. every month because I could never find one that worked exactly how I wanted it to.  But I first tried this a year ago and it's all I've used since.  And it lasts a long time, so don't be afraid of the price.  One container lasts me about 6 months, so you only have to buy it twice a year.  I'll be ordering my third order of it soon

I just had my fine, processed hair cut into a short layered wedge.  It was shoulder length before and I used a Revlon thermal-air styler to make it acceptable.  After using Dirt, I no longer have to spend ANY time styling it!!  I just blow dry, scrunching my hair with my fingers and when almost dry, I turn my head upside-down and apply about a dime size amount of Dirt into the roots. Flip up and I'm ready to go all in less than 3 minutes.  I find it important to rub Dirt between my palms to warm it up before applying.  Use a little first...you can always add more. It gave my hair great body and control. Hope this product works for you too

I have long, thick, wavy hair that loves to frizz up.  I have tried every anti-frizz, hairstyling product out there, and they either didn't work or weighed my hair down.  I didn't want to like this hair dryer and was hoping it wouldn't live up to the hype... BUT, it's excellent on my hair.  After using the dryer (with no styling product) my hair was straight, shiny and felt great.  For me, it didn't change the amount of time I dried my hair, so if your considering buying it for speed, don't, unless you have thin or short hair.  Is it worth the $200.00 price tag?  Depends on you personally, but I recommend you shop around because there are better deals out there

I have been reading about this miracle hair dryer for months in the beauty magazines I read, so I will admit I was very excited to pruchase it. The results however will amaze even the most cynical consumer. My hair has never looked so good when styled at home. True, it looks about the same as what my hairstylist does, but to me that is well worth the moderately high price tag. It was a good buy for me because I spend a lot of money buying a variety of cremes and glosses to make my hair pretty, and now I know it wasn't the products I put in that made my hair look bad, it was the dryer.I was so surprised to notice that even the ends of my hair were shiny, and my ends are sooo fried. The difference is astounding. 

I bought this dryer in a package with the babyliss straightener, and I would definately recommend that to anyone wanting to buy this dryer. For the same price you can get a free straightener. (A very good one!)

I had stopped using a regular hair dryer a few of months ago as I felt that my hair was becoming brittle and looking damaged.  However air drying my hair seemed to take forever. It was then that I heard about the T3 tourmaline Professional Ionic Hair Dryer from my hairdresser.  Initially the $200 price tag did put me off and I pushed the idea aside. But somehow it remained somewhere in the corner of my mind and one fine day after getting late for a meeting yet again, I decided to bite the bullet and buy the hairdryer. 

And I tell you, I have never been happier using a hair dryer. My hair started looking better and less damaged in the first few weeks itself. It has become smooth and silky and has a healthy glow.  Though the weight and the time taken were almost similar to my old model, the after effect is worth the price paid. The product does come with a 4-year warranty which is an added advantage to justify the exorbitant price. Though the sales brochures uses a lot of scientific terms like ionic mineral and blah... blah... I am not going to bother about it much as far as my hair appears healthy and saves me time so that I don't have to deal with being late for meetings. I   recommend this product to all who would love to have a mane to be proud of

This is a great idea for a product! For those of you who don't wash your hair every day, this is a great way to keep it looking and smelling fresh on days you don't wash it. I used this after 5 days without washing, and while it might have worked better within 3 or 4 days, it still freshened my hair and made it beautiful! Well done

I bought the Shampoo Theory and Condition Theory and this Redo Freshen-Up Mist. I have normal-type hair that needs to be washed every other day -- and if I use a lot of product, it needs to be washed every day. I have very sensitive skin too. This mist worked very well on my hair, definitely freshened it up and allowed me to restyle it with a quick blow dry. And it feels awesome on my skin. Well done, Jonathan

I don't know what the complaints about this product are.  It seems that people are trying to use it for extreme hold hairstyles.  This is not the purpose of this product.  I use it for my short haircut to make the ends stay spiky and styled out, and it works WONDERFULLY.  No matter how much you move your head, it stays in place, but somehow moves enough to keep you from having a stiff look.  And, when you brush your hair out at the end of the day, it feels like you never put it in.  Hair stays soft and feels clean.  The reason why this gel is thinner is that it isn't as sticky or goopey in your hair as other gels.  And it spreads out easier

I got a sample of this conditioner when I bought a similar product by another company.  I didn't care for the one I purchased, but the sample was awesome and I am going to buy the Jonathan conditioner.  I have always had fine limp hair and tried lots of volume products.  I used this for a week and this is the only thing I have ever seen any kind of difference with.  I love it!

Its effect very much depends on the climate you live in. If you live in a colder and dry climate, especially during winter it does exactly as it promises - great moisturizer, lines are diminished, as is puffiness. I really love using it - I am 35 and currently living in a cold and dry climate. But in hot and sometims humid climates, or during summer it just doesn't work as well - I don't know why. I like it a lot and this is my 3rd bottle, although I am using it as a seasonal eye care

I never wanted to waste my money on a manicure, because my polish would be chipping/peeling by the next day.  My pedicurist bet me that she could keep the polish on my manicure by using this stuff, and low and behold...it worked!  It kept the polish on for a week even through housecleaning and a trip to Vegas

Cold weather will be with us for a while and nothing makes one feel warmer than being wrapped in a delicious flowery fragrance - that certainly is Chanel No. 22. It's a blend of white flowers that has resulted in a scent which is both sweetly innocent and sensuous. 

Continuing in their use of symbolism and numbers after the overwhelming success of Chanel No. 5, Coco Chanel and Ernest Beaux developed yet another fragrance, naming it No. 22 for the year it was presented. 

It may have been created in 1922 but it's as up to the minute as tomorrow, especially in the new spray.

The Still Life bath bomb contains pretty sunflower petals that make this a summery bath experience. To be truthful, after putting this in the bath I walked away and came back into the room, wondering who was eating Fruit Loops! That is the scent of this "fun to take a bath before breakfast" experience. 

The fresh scent of Lemon and Sweet Wild Orange mingles with Bergamot and Gardenia extract. The result of this bath is a refreshing - I can face the day feeling. If you want to enhance the experience, try the Happy Hippy shower gel with grapefruit. The I Love Juicy Shampoo and Veganese Conditioner also complete the citrus experience. 

If you think the petals in this bath bombs are fun (the ones in my bath slipped right down the drain), wait until you try the Big Blue experience with seaweed. It does take an adventurous spirit to try some of these items, but as an official LUSH addict, I tend to dive into the experiences with abandon. You may also love Golden Slumbers (lavender and Neroli), Sex Bomb (Jasmine, Ylang Ylang, Clary Sage), Romance In A Stone (Wild Orange, Mandarin & Tangarine). 

Onward to try Tisty Toasty which I hear is a bit of a 
love spell style bath with rose petals.

I have always used, what I thought, the best skin products. But after using Relastin for only a few weeks, I was pleasantly surprised to see how amazingly this product has revitalized my skin! At this point I am sold out to Relastin and will only use this product

i've been wearing makeup to some degree or another for over 30 years, and i've never, ever found foundation as good, pure, non-irritating, glow-y or simply as PERFECT as bare minerals.  i truly believe it CLEARED UP my adult acne within a month that i started using it.  i just ordered this kit and i'm confident it will perform as well as the other products i have by this company.  don't waste your $$ on the imitators- everyone's jumped on the mineral makeup bandwagon now, but this original line is hands-down the best

Love the Bare Escentuals line of products. Not one for makeups to begin with, this allows me to even out my skin tone,give vibrance  and is good for the skin. Have never had any skin problems with this line and believe me my skin is sensitive

I've been using StriVectin-SD for almost two years.  There isn't a day that goes by that I don't get a complement on my skin.  I don't wear any make up, aside from lipstick.  My skin alway glows and the fine lines are hardly visible.  I'm in the beauty business and I recommend this product to my customers.  I am NOT a spokesperson for the company, only a happy and satisfied customer

i've gotten a few compliments on it...by my advice to the ladies who want to buy perfume via online...buy the smaller bottles first to see if you really like the scent...moreso than the big bottles.  i bought the $50 one and i do like it, but i think it's gonna take me awhile to finish it...so from now on, i'll buy the 1.7 oz. first and then buy the bigger bottles if i like the scent.  but overall, very fresh and sweet smelling..

Obviously some people don't care about reviewing an item, just about bashing a pop artist that doesn't deserve it.

Anyway, I think it smells great.  Obviously it does, or it wouldn't be the bestselling perfume right now.  But don't take my word for it, go to your nearest store and give it a sniff.  Also be sure to check out Fantasy, I think it smells even better

I have to agree with the previous reviewer when I say that possibly this IS "one for the ladies". But only in a good way! I first encountered this scent walking past the fragrance counter at the mall many years ago. At the time, it seemed that all the fragrances for men were heavy musks, orientals, spices, etc. This was...er...fruity. (I see you cringing!) It's lemony. Like a puff of lemon cake. A breeze over a lemon field in Tuscany. (are there fields of lemons in Tuscany? I don't know, but it's a mental pic, go with it!) A spritz of cologne following a bit of aftershave balm is a sure recipe to get yourself sniffed and cuddled. It doesn't bash you over the head with macho tones- it lures with tingling tartness. I have yet to meet a woman who dislikes the scent. And yes, I do steal it from my husband sometimes! On him (a light eyed blond) it stays true to the bottle scent, but on me (brunette with oily skin) it morphs to something with vanilla notes in the lemon. I think it's a great "safe" gift for people who aren't sure what cologne to buy for a new male friend.
I gave it four stars, because the cologne does need to be reapplied frequently to maintain a viable scent. The fragrance lasts for approximately four hours. But if you can't get noticed for your lemony deliciousness in four hours, you have more problems than a cologne will fix. (brush your teeth!) LAUGH!! :

I've tried all types of eyeliner, and they all end up smudging or flaking off, very messy by the end of a long day (or night).  I bought this one to wear at my wedding (in the fantastic chocolate shade) and it was absolutely perfect!  Well worth the price.  Great wear, easy to apply (with a very skinny-tipped brush, I ended up using a tiny paintbrush)and stays exactly where you put it

This is probably one to keep away from the kids. It smells good enough to eat and its frothy, whipped consistency makes it even more tempting! It's a bit pricey, but it lathers up really well. I found that about a teaspoon full on my loofah was more than enough for my shower. And it just smells amazing! Very refreshing and a definite mood-lifter. Now I want to try the Whipped Body Delight in this scent

I love the idea that this is an all natural mascara + has organic ingredients but nothing artifical or chemicals!!  This is the tipe of mascara which lengthens the lashes not volumises it (I think Dr. Hauschka doesn't make that kind). When it's time to wash it off it comes off very easy (spares your lashes).

Unfortunately I couldn't change my 4 star recommendation to 2...and this is a follow up on my previous review. 
When I'd been using this mascara for about 2 weeks I noticed that it started to flake except for some reason the flakes ended up in my eyes, not on my cheek or under my eyes. First I didn't know it was the mascara..I thought something went into my eyes but every single time I applied, it happened. Not straight away..but in about 2-3 hours later..This was very frustrating...I tried to put less of this product on my lashes but then I looked like I had nothing on. At this point I still had some flaking, not as bad as before, but it was still enough to hurt my eyes..so I just stopped using this product all together.
The only reason why I'd give 2 stars for this product instead of 1 because it's natural and organic...and I appriciate that fact. But that's about it.
I really wanted to like this product so I am very disappointed, it wasn't cheap either. Dr. Hauschka need to improve the quality of this product

I read many positive (and very few negative) reviews before I ordered my first tube.  I am 65 living in Florida and  have been using it once daily on face and back of hands for about 4 months.  The cream goes on smoothly, and I have had no negative reaction.  Friends tell me that my face is noticeably younger looking, with less wrinkles.  In fact two friends, based on my favorable experience, are also planning to purchase Kinerase

Foams nicely in the tub, rinses away cleanly.  Skin isn't left with any film.  Instead, your skin is left very soft and with a good scent.  Falling in love smells sweet and relaxing, and makes me think of cotton candy.  The large bottle lasts quite a while as a bath gel but goes considerably quicker if you choose to use it as a shower gel.  Recommend you use it with a loofah in the shower

I must say that I have been really impressed with this product. I tend to have skin that is combo/oily, which results in occasional pimples here and there. Not really acne, but annoying blackheads and bumps. I had been using something else similar to this with ok results. However, within just 2 days of beginning this, I noticed immediate results. My breakouts have been a non-event, and even if I get a pimple here or there, it's gone in a day. I've even noticed a drastic improvement in those hard-to-eliminate blackheads. My skin feels much smoother and my pores look better. I don't see how I could ever be without this

This is the only blemish treatment that I have ever tried that will get rid of anything. Ive been using it for 8 years and it has never let me down. 
You can use it as a spot treatment or if you have an area of clogged pores on your nose you can put a little on every night to help clear those up.
It isnt meant to go on the places of your face where you have no acne or blemishes though. It is strong and can cause a little peeling if you put it on your entire face.
It's a little pricey, but the size of this container will probably last you close to a year

This powder is great. It has great coverage without looking cakey. I also have sensitive skin and this has never bothered me. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it's still a little dark for very light skin and it needs to be "touched-up" a little more often than other powders I've tried, but it's worth it

This being my first badger brush, I don't know how competent a reviewer I can be, but i am really happy with it. It is large enough to hold a lot of foam (sometimes i fell like it actually holds too much). It is fairly heavy and robust, which i also like.
I've been using it for about 6 months now, and have a feeling that it is going to last for years.
Make sure to hang it to dry and wash it thoroughly after each use.
For anybody who is new to the wonderful world of shaving with a brush, i highly recommend this page as a intro: [...]

I have been using StriVectin SD eye cream for one month. I am 30 and have no wrinkles but some uneven skin tone, so I cannot comment on wrinkle restoration - my goal is prevention. However, I have a small unsightly broken blood vessel underneath one eye that I have had for 10 years. Applying StriVectin 2x per day has diminished the appearance significantly in just 4 weeks. I am of course hopeful that it will disappear  completely with continued use. I never expected that the broken blood vessel could be treated topically and I was thinking of having a laser treatment (a bit scary though near the eye!). I am thrilled with the cream and will stick with it.

       Laura Mercier cosmetics are a bit like bon-bons - you can't have just one.  She makes it easy for us with her Eye Color Duos - 2 compatible eye shadow colors in one mirrored compact.

	While there are five appealing color combinations, all fresh and sheer, my current favorites are Moss and Azure.  With two colors, one light and one dark, I have a veritable palette of possibilities.  Each can be used alone or together with one shading under the brow and the other on the lid.  Or, the colors can be mixed for a completely different effect.

	Colors are intensified by a second or third application.  (A sponge tipped swab is very effective for this.)

	Merci, Mercier!

I can't even begin to explain how much I love this product.   Although teen age acne is long gone for me, like most women at that certain time of the month, I get a little flair up here and there.   This product is great.   Totally takes the red out and I say speeds the healing process as well.  I found it it made them disappear over night if I dabbed it on there a few times a day and esp when I saw the begingings of one.   Ones I caught early on never really turned into full blown acne.  Yes it's pricey but I think it's worth every penny.

 If you are like me and get the occasional zit when you least expect it, then this works out well. It will not remove the zit, but it will cover the nasty monster pretty well!! I put it under my lancome powder and it really made a difference. Because it is clear it will blend in with whatever foundation or powder you use. oH YES and it covers all the redness that comes with those nasty zits. A girls new best friend :

If you're like me, you get the occasional zit at the most inopportune time. BeneFit's Boo Boo Zap! is a bit spendy for such a small amount (about the size of a small tube of lipstick) but it does help. While it won't erase the zit overnight, it will get the red out. You can dab some on under or over makeup too because it goes on clear, not tinted. Definitely worth a try

I used this product in the evening and noticed immediate plumping. I also use LipFusion XL (50.00)- but sometimes the results are not long-lasting. When I used the Too-Faced Lip Injection Mask- the results were immediate, and seemed to continue for hours. When I woke in the morning- my lips were very plumped- much more so than with Lip Fusion Alone. I will use these products together- the Lip Injection Mask from Too-Faced is amazing! Used first, then with Lip Fusion XL layered on top after rinsing off the mask- it seriously looked like I had undergone medical-procedure lip-plumping! I highly reccommend this Lip Injection Mask.

I am 51 and recently visited an upscale retail store in Manhattan.  The Yves St Laurent gal behind the cosmetic counter noticed my complexion was a little sallow - put this product about an inch on each side of my nose and blended it in..what a difference it made...a worthwhile investment..I use it under my eyes and just about all over my face for a nice touch-up, concealer and brightener..covers freckles and sun spots, too

Awesome product - best concealer I've ever used.  It is lightweight and does not settle into the under eye "creases" that my almost 50-year-old eyes have.  The pink undertone brightens and lightens.

I've used Paris Hilton perfume for about a year now.  Ordering it online at Amazon was terrific.  I didn't have to drive, and the price is half the amount you would spend in the department store!!!
If you haven't tried this fragrance, please do so.  You will be wonderfully surprised at how special it makes you feel!

This Paris Hilton perfume is wonderful. I got it 2 months ago in September as one of my birthday presents from my mum. I'd heard of the Paris Hilton perfume a while back but I thought it wouldn't be that good however a few days before my birthday my mum brought home a tester and I was really shocked. The perfume smells delicous, every time I have it on I get tons of compliments. It really is a gorgeous scent perfect for night and day. I have had a lot of perfumes in my life, some of them really expensive but this is by far the best ever. I would recommend this to anyone

This product will not work for everyone. It's not really for people with straight, fine hair.  It's formulated to target mostly women of color who have tightly curled, thick, natural hair.  I apply about a nickle-size of this stuff to the ends of my hair before I style it. It leaves my hair soft, manageable, and conditioned - eliminating breakage so that it can grow long and healthy. The aroma is a little too earthy for my personal taste, but I can handle that as long as the natural ingredients work. I give it 5 stars

I love this product.  It has healed my brittle hair after being bleached one too many times.  I use it every day and it not only heals and conditions my hair but it holds my style in place.  

As some people mentioned, it can make your hair greasy.  You have to make sure to massage it into your hair and only use a little.

I know it sounds cliche, but I have literally tried every acne product both over the counter and prescription. Such products include (but are not limited to) Proactiv, Exposed Skin Care, Differin, Accutane, Neutrogena products, Clean and Clear, etc. I have never had results like this. I previously tried the Murad Acne Complex and found it to be a little too harsh for my red, irritated, sensitive skin. I currently switched to the sensitive line for the Murad Acne Complex which consists of this cleanser, Moisturizing Acne Treatment Gel and the Cellular Replenishing Serum. I have found that my cistic acne is gone, the blotchiness is reduced and the number of whiteheads has drastically reduced. My skin has never looked so smooth in all my pre-teen and young adult life and I have only been using this particular line for 4 days! In addition to the sensitive Acne complex, I would also recommend getting the Clarifying Toner. And remember, a little goes a long way with these products!

I recently became a fan of Body Shop products and am only sorry that I didn't try them sooner.  Their products are all, without fail, of superior quality.  The Satsuma line especially is wonderful, and is my favorite scent from the Body Shop.  It is the juicy fresh smell of tangerines/oranges.  I have read some reviews that it reminds people of a creamsicle type scent but I completely disagree with that. I have never liked creamsicle scents and I love Satsuma.  It is not cloying or too sweet.  It is a very pure scent and I always feel clean and beautiful while wearing it.  One other thing to note about this product...  I do not always like perfume oils because the scent is not always accurate when compared to other products in the same line.  I am not sure if this is because sometimes the oils are so concentrated that they smell like "too much".  The Satsuma oil is not like that at all - it smells true to the rest of the line.  The scent also lasts for a long time after being applied, due to the fact that it is a perfume oil.  A little goes a long way - I would not be surprised if the bottle lasted for over a year.  I love this product and give it my highest recommendation.

This is currently my absolute favorite scent. I get so discouraged when smell somthing in a store love it, buy it, take it home and put it on, and smells completely different on me. I have never had that problem with this scent. it's smells delicious in the bottle and on the skin, that is if you like citrus. It smells like a fresh, ripe Orange, with the slightest hint of spice. The man in my life finds it quite cuddle worthy. If you are not familiar with perfume oils, just somthing to note. they are highly concentrated, a little goes a long way. it also phases nicely, from intense to pleasently subtle and is long lasting. Another bonus is that there are only few ingredients, so it's less likely to irritate sensitive skin. One bottle will last and last, there is a flexable applicator wand inside the lid. I really can't say enough about this wonderful fragrance

I have very thick hair.  I stopped relaxing it one year ago and felt it was not very easy to manage.  I found the Kerastase Shampoo and combined it with the smoothing mask and my hair became much more easy to manage!  Now I can comb through it as soon as the conditioner is rinsed

My significate other bought the shampoo for me, I use the hair butter and various other products from Carol's Daughter.  I was very fortune to actually make it to the store in New York. I have very short barber-style hair and the scent drives people wild. I will continue to buy these products; if you like the fruity-tuttie smells and your hair grease non petroleum based, Carol's Daughter is for you

This is a wonderfully light sunscreen that makes my face feels very smooth.  Definitely worth the money! If you do buy this product, make sure you apply it over your moisturizer, otherwise it will flake when it dries.

This is an excellent product but I have a problem disguising the white look it leaves on my face. At first I thought it was because I used too much, but even when I use only a tiny amount it is still white.

It will certainly suit persons with pale complexions. Wish there was a tint to it

This stuff is wonderful!  I still use a moisturizer w/ SPF 15, but why settle for SPF 15 when you can get SPF 40?  This is not a creamy sunscreen that makes your skin feel all oily and like it can't breathe, instead it's more on the liquid side and you just quickly rub it in, then you can go ahead and put your regular moisturizer and makeup over it.  It's lovely and light and you can wear it every day.  It's the only sunscreen I have found that has enough SPF coverage for my sensitive pale skin but isn't thick enough to clog up my pores and cause breakouts. It may seem expensive, but not only is the quality of the product worth it, but you only need a small amount.  I wear it during the spring and the summer, and after a year I'm still working on the same bottle.  I wasn't sure if it was going to be effective (not being from a brand that you usually associate with rugged outdoor activity), but after a week by the beach, I was the only one who's face wasn't burned all red, even though everyone else had been wearing Coppertone and Bullfrog facial sunscreen

I absolutely love this scent. I originally got the perfume and the 3 in 1 as a gift set and loved it so much I bought the lotion. The scent is a very light sort of cotton candy smell. I have a huge sweet tooth and just love the sweet smells. If you like cotton candy or a sugary smell then you'll love this

When I first tried this perfume, it reminded very much of Victoria's Secret Pink--it had that same distinctly sweet, strongly scented unique floral note, yet here the bouquet was significantly softer, sweeter.  It would work well for someone who likes a sweet, girly scent that is light yet still pronounced.  The one drawback is that the staying power is poor:  I couldn't detect any trait of this just a few hours later.  This is a bit disappointing give the high price, yet this still might be a good choice for someone who is looking for an everyday fragrance and doesn't mind having to reapply

I absolutely fell in love with this fragrance.  It smells like a day at the County Fair, absolutely lovely.  You have to layer it though to make it last.. wash with the shower gel, put on the body lotion first thing when you get out of the shower or bath, (perfumes "stick" better that way, while you're "moist"), and then spray.  If you wash your hair, spray while your blow-drying it out.  Carry the spray in your purse, you will need to "touch up" during the day

I was afraid of this fragrance in the bottle, since it smelled like carmelized sugar to me. I tried the shower gel first, loved it, had to try the perfume.  Everyone loves it! My friend even asked if she could copy me and wear it too! Of course I said yes, everyone needs a little love!  We both agree to spritz a little extra on if you want others to smell it, it goes on very light. An extra spritz is not obnoxious with this scent

This scent is truly intoxicating.  I have tried various perfumes like Arpege, Evelyn Rose and J'adore but there was always something missing.  Flower by Kenzo is by far the most satisfying fragrance.  It has the Elegance of Arpege,
Sensuality of Evelyn Rose and Classiness of J'adore.  This product-line also have matching Deoderant so not to clash with the perfume. How nice is that! It is not too strong either but lasts for a long time. I have at last found my favorite scent that makes me feel really good

My hair tends to fall out due to me not eating enough protein, so NEW! (Hair) is a lifesaver.  As others have said, it lathers like you wouldn't believe -- you really only need to roll it in your hands two or three times to get enough for a thick lather -- and it has an amazing scent.  (Sniffing the bar can actually be a bit addictive...you can smell it really strongly even before you open the box!)  I've found that keeping it in a small lightly covered dish in my bedroom, away from the moisture of the bathroom, is the best way to preserve it for a while.  (Also, it works as an accidental room freshener -- seriously, the smell is incredible!)

My only wish is that the scent would last a little longer in my hair, since it doesn't really stick, even right after showering, unless I use a lot of lather, and that ends up being expensive since then the bar doesn't last as long.  Most of the time, there isn't even much of a hint, whereas other Lush shampoos can make your hair smell wonderful, even a bit overpowering, for days.

Also, unlike some of the other Lush products, it leaves my hair fairly flat.  It's true that it helps with making hair really soft and shiny, but it seems to have the opposite effect when it comes to volume, and that's not so good when you're already having some hair loss.  Using a mostly scent-free conditioner after is almsot necessary, at least in my experience.

I think NEW! (Hair) is a terrific shampoo for its hair-restoring qualities and general sniffability, but at the same time, it could be a little better with its more cosmetic qualities.  Buy it more for the former than the latter if you want the most enjoyment and value out of it.  And if you do have hair loss, trust me -- the price is worth it

My title says it all. This smells so amazing, and is such a lush and fabulous lather, that I will never wash with any other soap again. I even bought the perfume because I found myself sniffing my arms all day long after a shower. 

It's fantastic, it's totally worth the money, and it lasts a long time. One bottle lasts me 2-3 months, bathing every day. I've even used this in my hair before... but it tends to dry out my hair a lot and I need a lot of moisture because I have blonded curly hair.

The Kerastase line is hard to find (used to be only sold in Kerastase salons, I believe.) The shampoos do EXACTLY what they say. In this case, this is a moisturizing shampoo for dried hair that may be overly chemically treated. I only wish they came in larger bottles

Since I was in high school, so many women have praised the wonders of Almost Lipstick in Black Honey.  I finally self-gifted and purchased for myself, and all of my expectations have been met.  The color is initially scary in the tube, but at the very least swipe it on your hand - you'll see that it is actually a very wearable sheer brownish raspberry color.  You can layer it for a stronger color, or swipe it over lip balm to make it even more sheer.  The resulting effect is your lips, but better.  The color of your lips is improved and they are moist and shiny looking.  If you layer repeatedly over dry lips it is a very shiny deep red brown color.  I've seen Black Honey worn by fair/medium Asian and White women and has looked flattering on every one of them.  Lastly, the product does not smell.  It has no perfumes that become disgusting as the day wears on, nor does it have that cheap waxy smell/taste.  A fabulous product

I have: long, thick, fine hair that is naturally wavy.  I don't color my hair but I do get frizzies and split ends, and some dryness.  I tried this product out after receiving a small sample with a [...] order, and fell in love with it.  I -love- the smell, and was surprised that other people didn't seem to.  I vastly prefer it to some of the faker, more chemical smells that a lot of shampoos seem to use.

I didn't use it as a leave in, but did the deep conditioning treatment, and afterwards I kept flipping my hair forward over my shoulder, both to smell it and to just feel how amazingly soft it was.  This product left my hair looking healthy, shiny, and gorgeous for days.  I get a fair number of compliments on my hair in general, but after I used this stuff I was getting stopped on the street.  Everyone from the lady at Starbucks to my professor mentioned how beautiful my hair looked.  I highly recommend it.

I have tried a lot of hair products, including some (like Fekkai's glossing cream) made with olive oil, and had better results with Ojon (though I do like a lot of Fekkai products).  Other products I recommend are: Healthy Sexy Hair shampoo, conditioner, and leave-in conditioner, Jonathan Product Anti-Frizz Serum, Origins Happy Ending conditioner, and Fekkai products for curly and straight hair, depending on your mood :)  Products I don't recommend include Suave and Fekkai's Glossing Shampoo (left my hair shiny all right, but frizzy.)

I would suggest ordering it from Sephora, as they carry several sizes, give samples with all online orders, and are very, very good at taking returns, even if you've tried the product out and just don't like it

I use Renergie Microlift Active Redefining Treatment as a preconditioner prior to the placement of foundation on my face. I cannot imagine using anything else. I find it challenging to find a product that allows my foundation to go on silky smooth yet without feeling greasy or causing blemishes. I am in my fourties and this is the best product I have found

  I have extremely dry skin that builds up and needs exfoliation frequently, and I've tried every body wash, gritty scrub, brush and soap known, from Clarins down to Caress, and this bar works like magic for me!  I didn't notice fantastic decrease in cellulite, and the little bumps do wear off. But using the soap practically "molts" me, leaving dead skin behind in the bathtub (yikes!), and I'm ready for application of other products right into my new skin (Fat Girl Slim...Clarins Total Body Firming Cream...I prefer Dior Plasticity).  And goodbye ingrown hairs- the stuff is great for prevention.  Did I metion a great exfoliator prior to self-tanning?  This stuff is a GREAT BUY!  The long-lasting soapy smell that interferes with my perfume is the only reason I gave it 4 stars

Tweezerman Browmousse is a clear gel that you brush onto your eyebrows to hold them in place. I had tried other brands of styling gels for brows and was left very disappointed - they flaked and looked all stiff and gross.

Since I am such a huge fan of the Tweezerman tweezers, I figured I would give their Browmousse a try and boy, was I ever satisfied! This gel held my brows in place all day without a single stray. No flaking! No stiff brows!

And it is so easy to apply. It comes with a mascara style brush that you simply whisk over your brows to style and keep them where you want them. It stays all day and comes off easily with make up remover. 

Browmousse is a definite step up from all other brands I've tried. I will recommend this product to all my friends.

This is the best concealer I have ever worn.  It covers well without making me look fake or cakey around the eyes.  Not greasy either.  The powder that comes with this is a nice touch for traveling.  However, I gave this a four star because it is pricey.  Amazon should try and give customers discounts.

This stuff goes on easy, stays well (but WILL rub off with water, won't withstand a good cry).  Nice.  Not quite as nice as the Victoria's Secret liner (I swear by that stuff, discontinued 3-4 years ago), but WAY better than anything cheaper.  I have TRIED other things.  Plus, won't irritate my very sensitive eyes

This eyeliner really matches the description, it goes on super smooth and doesn't tug or drag.  I was told at the counter that it was "water resistant" but it's really not.  I used to wear it under my lower eyelashes, but by the end of the day, it would be totally smudged and gross.  I would even try to put powder over it, but to no avail.  However, in defense of Laura, I am over 40 and the fine lines below my eyes aren't friendly to many pencil eye liners.  I was just hoping against hope that Laura's would be different!  So, now I only use it over the upper lid

I have used many, many products from the cheapest drugstore ones to the high end department store stuff and Kinerase cream is truly one of the best for overall skin improvement. I am a big fan of minimal redness and irritation and this cream delivers in spades. Leaves my skin beautifully soft, super smooth and all without added perfume (who's going to smell your face?) and additives. I have also used the lotion version which contains retinyl palmitate, but I much prefer this cream which adds more moisture and doesn't contain any retinoids which can cause irritation. Isn't that the whole premise and purpose of Kinerase anyway? Great stuff

I'm very particular about the stuff I put on my face.  I've used Nivea Aloe, Jack Black, Kiehls, & Baxter among others.  I decided to give it a shot and all I can say is wow.  It says it's fragrance free, but it's got a small (very very very small) hint of lemon perhaps?  You only need a liberal amount and you're good to go.  Moisture is retained with glycerin and it soothes with aloe and chamomile (Mmmm).  If you're looking for subtle, yet tasteful facial lotion that's made for men, you've gota try this.  It's even allergy tested.  Not to mention, part of the proceeds are donated to prostate cancer research.

If you have dry skin on your hands these gloves are very nice.  I place mine in the microwave for 15 seconds while I apply moisturizer to my hands.  Slide the gloves onto your hands as soon as the microwave is finished.  In 15 minutes you have a quick, but effective moisturizing treatment.  If your hands are really dry you could do the same thing but leave them on overnight.  I found the overnight option to be a little warm on my hands.  But, it might work fine for you.

These socks are 94% cotton and 6% Spandex.  They can be machine washed and tumbled dried.  I have not found it necessary launder them each time I use them.  I use a light moisturizer (Cetaphil), so you might have a different experience if you use a heavier product to moisturize.

I would highly recommend this product.

This is the best long-wearing lipstick I have ever bought. It lasts on me for about 6-7 hours...through meals, drinks, etc. The best part is that it isn't flakey. It also has little hints of "glitter" in it, that really make your lips shine. The icing on the cake is that it has a subtle watermelon smell.

This is hands down the best all day lipwear I have ever owned. I own alot!!! Not only does it stay on all day beautifully but it does not dry your lips out. With other extended wearlipsticks you are given a seperate hydrating gloss. Sephora Maniac Long Wearing Lipstick does not need it. My lips never dried out and looked moist and smooth all day not cakey and cracked as others tend to do. Purchase this lipstick with cofidence and without hesitation. You will not be disappointed

For a mirror shine and one that doesn't disappear on the rim of a glass with the first sip my choice is MAC. Lipglass feels good on your lips, as if it contained some emollients. And (this is a big AND) it's not tacky or sticky. 

The colors are a veritable palette of shades to suit every mood, occasion and skin tone. They range from a playfully innocent baby-doll nude to a dramatic dark diva red. 

Another plus (and this is a big PLUS following the big AND) MAC Lipglass is so price accessible that you can easily pick a bouquet of these delicious shades. Try adding a Lipglass over a country cousin lipstick for a wow impact. 

Enjoy!

I changed this review from when I first wrote it a couple of weeks ago.  When I first wrote it, the title was "I like it".  Now I've changed it to "I love it!!!" because the more I use it, the more sure I am that I will not EVER buy regular mascara again.  This mascara will NOT smudge!  It will not leave "racoon eyes" under your lash line.  It goes on where you put it and stays there until you take it off.  It also does not irritate my eyes.  I never thought I would find a mascara that didn't make me want to rub and rub my eyes.  I hate rubbing my eyes because I know it makes them baggy and makes wrinkles.  I have been seeing mascara which forms a tube around the lash advertised in high-end catalogs lately, and have been intrigued.  When I found out Philosophy, a brand I really respect, had this type of mascara available, I had to order it right away.  As soon as the UPS man brought it, I applied it.  It makes your lashes look really long!  They have a lot of individual definition, and show up as very distinct.  This mascara doesn't "fatten" the lashes, but it lengthens them so much, and it is a much cleaner look than the lash thickening mascara I have been using.  I really like the look, and the mascara does not smudge, or rinse off easily in water.  It seems to stay on really well, without the clumpy, greasy feeling I get from waterproof mascara.  It comes off neatly in little chunks when you rub a little "Purity Made Simple" cleanser on it.  I really like this mascara, and I will buy it again.  Actually I am going to throw out all my other kinds of mascara and only get this kind

I bought the Lotion #2 and the Moisurizing Gel about 3 weeks ago [which is wonderful], but passed on the soap. I'm a teenager who has a slight problem with acne, so that's why I bought the Neutrogena Acne Wash instead, which has salicylic acid that will help for acne. 
By itself, the acne wash does not work, but so far with the Clinique, I have not broken out at all! Not a single pimple. Everything is smooth and toned. I love my skin and it GLOWS.
I recommend getting the milder lotion for people with fairer and more sensitive skin, as this is known to peel and cause redness to some.
The salicylic acid is necessary for me and my light breaks-out-during-THAT-time-of-month skin. So if you do not have an acne problem, I think any soap is alright. 

To anyone who is worried about spending too much money:
If it does not work for you, there is a guarantee that lets ou get all your money back. It's great

I like this scent. My first thought was pears, before reading what the notes were, yes, apples. This is not a hardcore apple scent, but enough so.

Very fresh and sweet but not too sweet. Crisp and spring-like. A hint, a tiny hint of dandelions and a tiny bit of rose, just a tiny bit. 

My husband likes this scent on me as well, which is saying a lot. He hates roses and foody scents, but still likes this.

I have purchased many different brow pencils over the years and finally found one that is truly wonderful!  The color is perfect and the application is easy and the results are phenomenal. The Bourjois Precision Eyebrow Pencil is the best I've ever used.  I highly recommend it. Also, the brow brush that comes attached to the cover is very nice and leave the brows looking 'finished' and natural. I have senitive skin and had absolutely no problems with this product

This keychain is very cute and great if your'e friends want to try it becuase it is cheap, so they can buy it for themselves.  I have the Pixie flavor, and it is great. But, it fell off my purse once, so that's why I am not giving this item five stars. If they made the keychain a little stronger, I would definetly give it a five

I recently bought all 3 of Hard Candys, Key To My Heart Lipgloss. There are 2 different shades of lipgloss, a sheer shade and a darker thicker shade. My favorite one out of the 3 is Pop, It is a sheer light purple with shimmer and a darker purple gloss. They smell and taste like candy. It dangles on my keys and it is so cute! It might be handy to bring a pocket lipbrush with you so it doesnt get on your fingers

This product is just another example of why I am an Anthony's customer for life. I could spend all day extolling the virtues of the entire Anthony product line... 
Meanwhile, this alcohol free toner is just fantastic. If you have super-duper sensitive skin as I, you will love this product.. I guarantee it. The toner does not burn, irrate, cause peeling or rashes to develop, nor does it dry your skin out. It leaves your face feeling clean and refreshed, with a very mild lite scent that dissipates in seconds. When using this product, only a few drops is needed per application onto a cotton ball. To get the full benefits of this toner, the only requirements are just a few light and gentle sweeping outward motions, away from the face. Before you know it.. "Voila"! the daily grime and pollutants no longer reside on your face

To be totally honest, I'm not entirely sure what these ingredients are all about, but I do know one thing: this stuff really works! After using this for a couple of weeks, I started noticing a visible change in the small dark spots on my face. It wasn't dramatic, but I kept using the Repair Formula, and about a month later, I could definitely see a difference! People have commented on the way I look, and I recommend it to all of them. It just makes your skin look healthier.

I've been using this product for a few years now, and it always rescues me when my eczema pops up in the cold weather.  I once did a comparison between cortisone cream and Dream Cream, and the Dream Cream won hands down because it kept the scalies away longer than the cortisone did.

The scent is lavender/herbal and very nice.

I have a persistent patch of eczema on my neck, that Dream Cream cleared up in just a couple of weeks. I've also been using it daily as a hand lotion and just after I get out of the shower on my legs. It has completely gotten rid of the red, bumpy and scaly patches that have plagued my legs in the winter. I've tried dozens of body lotions/creams and this is my absolute favorite

What I really like about this product is that little goes a long, long way.

I used to use various body butters on my driest skin, and this product is like those in that you don't need to use much of it.  Just a bit is enough, even for really dry areas like elbows, knees, and feet.  I find one fingertipful is enough for both knees and elbows or for both feet; two fingertipfuls are enough for my legs, post-shaving.

I like it better than body butters because it is light and not greasy (unless you use too much), and you can use it on your whole body, not just the drier spots.

Another big plus is the scent: it's a fresh, clean herbal scent that doesn't linger over-long, so you can enjoy it while you're putting it on and not have to smell it all day long

I received a coupon for a free sample of the Kinerase C6 Peptide in a magazine. It said it was a thirty dollar value, it was .25 oz and I was surprised at how small thirty dollars was! But what the heck it was free. Well it has lasted over three weeks so far using it once to twice a day and it actually seems to work! My complexion is brighter I have less adult acne, a constant problem, and I just feel my face looks better. I've been ill for a few months and my face was looking bad, I think so anyway. I'm one of those people who look ten years younger than my age but I certainly wasn't lately. All I can say is it works very well for me so much so that I'm probably going to invest the 96.00 to buy the 1 oz, I figure it's worth it and will last about three months.

I always buy this soap when I travel in France.  When I found it on Amazon, I was elated!  It is so moisturizing that I never need to use any body creams or lotions.  With its simple and pure properties of Olive Oil, Vegetable Oil and Mediterranean Sea Salted water; "Savon de Marseille" is the ultimate soap to use for dry skin.  The large 1000gm. blocks are a great value, and they can be cut easily into four individual 250gm. bars.  Great for ones' own personal use.  For gift giving the 300gm. bars are perfect!  If you want to walk out of the shower and not immediately feel compelled to put on hand cream or body cream, use this Masterpiece Soap

This soap works well for sensitive skin.  Smells like Olive Oil but hey that's why they named it olive oil soap.

This is a great lipstick and a wonderful idea from CARGO. I would very much recommend it. The lindsay color is great and the formula is very smooth and sheer enough so that it goes well with your skin. The four stars are because I love smelly things... and this one just smells like lipstick.  It could smell yummier I suppose. But so far, I love it

Clinique's Bare Brilliance is one of my absolute favorite lipsticks ever!
It has a fairly sheer finish with lovely little sparkles in it.  I have Berrylicious(sheer grape) and Cherry Quartz(sheer, true red--doesn't look like it does on the color swatch) and neither overwhelms my pale skin.  I wouldn't be caught dead without a Bare Brilliance lipstick in my makeup bag or purse!

After looking and looking for the perfect brown lipstick that wasn't red or too dark I tried this and bought it on the spot. This is the best color if you're looking for a shimmer and just enough color. This lipstick isn't sticky, dry or cakey

I've used a nylon scrubbie for years.  The Salux bath towel is much better!  I received it as a gift from someone who had one and knew how wonderful it was.  It has a fairly rough texture which is a fantastic exfoliator.  I use it with a bath gel (never soap, it's too drying) and my skin has never been softer.  It's extra long length makes it perfect for getting your entire back.  It drys very quickly - Can't live without it

This perfume is my absolute favorite!!! It smells so good. I love it! And this roll on is so easy. You can just pack it  in your purse and use it whenever. Its so convenient! But you won't have to really put it on several times day. Once is enough. The scent carries on all day long! I 
highly recommend this fragrance as a gift to anyone

"Frankincense contains sesquiterpenes, which may help oxygenate the pineal and pituitary glands. As one of the ingredients for the holy incense, it was used anciently to help enhance one's communication with The Creator. It may help promote a positive attitude." ~ pg. 148, Reference Guide for Essential Oils by Connie and Alan Higley

Bergamot oil is anti-inflammatory, antiseptic and good for the skin. Christopher Columbus originally brought Bergamot back to Italy from the Canary Islands. Frankincence oil is antiseptic and sedative

Together they are perfect for when you are feeling really stressed out or grumpy and want to relax. Toss this in the tub and you will have a violet fizz that soon turns the water a beautiful silky purple. 

This may be the most beautiful LUSH bath and the essential oils make you feel more grounded. Perfect as a bath before you do your relaxing yoga routine at night before bed. You may want to skip lotion after your bath and try the It's a Pleasure Treasure massage bar which is scented with myrrh. If you enjoy the Bergamot in this product, it is also in Lush The Olive Branch and The Comforter Bubble Bar. Cynthia Sylvia Stout shampoo and Veganese conditioner go well with this experience since they are also citrusy. 

I will agree, this doesn't exactly have a blackberry scent, but it is a beautiful violet colored bath that will impress with its calming and skin healing properties.

This is my absolute favorite product by LUSH. I received a huge box of bath ballistics for my birthday, and out of the whole thing this was the best! it made the water a nice purple color (without a ring around the tub) and made my skin smell great - even the next day! I would recommend this one to any first-timers, so you can see what the buzz around LUSH is all about! I am stocking up on this one

This is a great product.  The only reason I don't give it a full five stars is that it is alleged to not have 'significant' amounts of vitamin E, which is supposed to be its selling point.  I, however, buy it because for the five years or so that I have used this product, I have gotten a LOT of compliments about the firmness of my skin, and since I have started using it my skin has actually become LESS oily than when I first started using it.  

I first purchased this product because of some damage I had done to my skin using a popular acne product.  My skin looked and felt as though I had been burned by acid.  I promptly stopped using that product and purchased this cream along with the cream cleanser because I hoped these products would be soothing.  They definitely were.  Within a matter of weeks my skin started to feel better.  Moreoever, it took on a plump, more youthful appearance (no sagging!).  Within a month or so, my skin was much less oily than it had been.  

Since I first purchased this product I have strayed but have always come back.  In the winter I use the heavier nightcream and have experienced the same results.  The regular cream is pink in color and does not smell of perfume.  Texture wise it is heavier than a lotion but still feels slippery to the touch.  I highly recommend you try this cream

Rock Star soap appeals to my playful side and the scent in this soap leaves one a little giddy. The sweet vanilla fragrance is blended with perfumes and the result is something like a spicy vanilla and strawberry milkshake. Can I say yum? 

This is absolutely delish and I think they may have added a little cinnamon to the mix. I love keeping lush soaps by the sink because they don't seem to dry out my hands as much as gel soaps. This one is perfect in combination with the Smitten hand cream. 

Rock Star soap left me dreaming about buying other "vanilla" themed items like Think Pink (which I tried), Creamy Candy (a bubble bar), Sympathy for the Skin (which I'm dying to try) and Honey Trap (which I just tossed recklessly into my shopping cart). Candy Fluff sounds like it would go well with this experience. If you love this soaps creamy consistency, Gratuitous Violets, Sultana of Soap and Alkmaar will impress. 

Any chance the vanilla toothpaste will be listed here soon? Wish, wish...

it has been over 4 hours since i showered and i still catch the scent as i move. it is such a sweet, sugary smell that reminds me of summertime and pop music. this may sound like an odd description, but it smells the way the inside of a jawbreaker tastes, sweet and sugary. it also has a hint of cherry or strawberry to it. yum yum! i got two bars and cut one up into small cubes to wrap in cloth and put in my dresser drawers to scent my clothes. i love love love this stuff. 

the reviewer who said this only lasts a week must use a TON of soap (though who could blame her with a soap like this?)or take multiple baths/showers a day, because i have used it for a week and it doesn't look any smaller than when i first opened it. it REALLY helps to unwrap soap as soon as you get it so it can air harden before you use it. this helps it last longer.

A Word to the Wise about Size

If this is your first time buying Lush soap online, be forewarned. You will receive a piece that is about 1" thick and 4-5" long. In other words, you will be receiving a fairly small piece of soap. If you have a Lush store near you, I strongly recommend that you go and smell the huge chunks of soap they have on display. Once you find a scent you like, buy a  lb brick of it. It will cost a little over $20, but it is worth it if you find a soap you love. I also find that it is easier to experience the full scent of a soap with a bigger slice. I know that Lush stores are few and far between (the closest one to me is about 35 miles away--not that far, but too far to be convenient), but if you can grab a couple of friends and make a road trip out of it, it's an adventure!

Now, on to Rock Star. What a delightful soap. If you are a fan of the Mmmm....Melting Marshmallows bath melt, then you will also enjoy Rock Star. The scent is the same. It is also the same as Snow Fairy Shower Gel and the Creamy Candy bath melt.  I cannot quite place my finger on the scent. The main ingredient in it is Vanilla absolute, but this smells much more sweet and girly.  There is a definite floral scent lurking under the vanilla, but I am at a loss to try and describe it! It sort of smells like warm cotton candy with a hint of brown sugar. It's the closest I can come to trying to describe the scent.

The scent of Rock Star will linger on your skin for the entire day. It's absolutely wonderful. It also leaves your bathroom smelling wonderfully fresh.  Every time my husband uses the upstairs bathroom, he has to come find me and ask what smells so good in our bathroom. It is a fabulously creamy soap and it lathers quite well. If you have white tile in your bathroom, it will leave a pink lather pile on the tile, but it is easy enough to wash off. 

There are a couple of minor downsides to Rock Star. But they are minor: 

1. It melts way too fast. I just wished it lasted a bit longer.

2. It can leave the skin feeling a bit too squeaky clean. When I first started using Rock Star, I thought it would give me dry skin, but that hasn't been the case. It just feels a bit dry after showering. 

Despite these small issues, Rock Star is the perfect soap to make you feel a bit girly and a bit sexy, all at the same time.

I can't give this enough stars!  Truly love this!  I just purchased a huge hunk from the Herald Square store!  I'm well impressed with this soap!   When I first got it from Lush I was disappointed with the smell.  It made me a bit sick.   Next day I hopped in the shower with it and started singing like a rock star!  OH BABY I love the smell!  It's like a brand new smelly eraser you had when you were a kid!   Smells good enough to eat!   This is on my MUST have list of items!  Gimme that fruity-candy goodness!  If you adore it...layer it up with Snow Fairy and Candy Fluff...and float around in a haze of sweetness all day long!  Beware..can be very addicting once you use it!

There is actually science to support this serum, and per a D Magazine article, several female dermatologists use it on their own skin.  You spread a few drops on your face (and I use it on my neck and back of my hands as well) in the morning before sunscreen or makeup.  It does not irritate my sensitive skin (I have rosacea and seb derm) or clog my pores.  A lot of expensive products are just hype, but I think the science and the fact that so many dermatologists use it make this one worth the money.

Sephora Roll-up blotting paper is so handy. Whenever you have to freshen up, this is great to use before you powder your face. All you do is rip off the right about of paper you want and blot your face. They feel weightless and matte skin. Just imagine all the oil that gets trapped into a powder puff. gosh. disgusting! Best of all, you get so much paper, the roll is never-ending! It's so tiny and compact, you would even want to share them with your friends

This is one of the most perfect concealers I have ever used. It goes on nice and creamy (does not pull on your skin when applying) and covers those imperfections.  You also do not need a lot of product to get the job done.  The colors are very natural and I have found a perfect color in Sand for me. I will buy this product again.

I have been using this powder for about 5 years. It is amazing. I have problems with red cheeks and breakouts. Once I put on my concealer and foundation, I put on this powder and it is truly what makes my imperfections disappear. It even comes with the perfect application brush. This powder is worth every penny because it does what a powder should do

I did my Christmas shopping in my warm fluffy nightgown. The package arrived before Christmas. I did not pay for gas for shopping, I did not fight for a parking space and I did not stand in long lines to pay for my prize.
My mom's favorite cologne was also at least 10-20 dollars cheaper then the big stores overhead pricing. This is the way to go

I bought this along with the "Some Kind of Gorgeous" foundation faker.  I don't have the best skin, (oily), but like a more natural look.  These two product together are so great.  I look natural, but healthier.  And my skin stays less shiny all day.  I use the other side of the foundation sponge to apply it

I first got to smell this amazing perfume as a sample in a Cosmo magazine.  Since then I could not help but want to keep smelling it over and over again. 

It reminds me alot of my perfume I use now, but it smells so much more sweeter.  I now use Jovan White Musk(love this one as well), but decided to try this perfume and fell in love with it as well.  I love musky scents like this one.  This perfume has a crisp, warm, and musky smell to it.

I would highly recommend this perfume to any of the ladies out there that are looking for something to drive their man wild, trust me, it works wonders.  

I receive compliments all the time on this perfume and it has a long lasting affect that does not get sour or overpowering as it wears on throughout the day,which most perfumes can do.

I love this perfume, what more can I say............other then I highly recommend it!!!!!!!!!!

A personal tip I would like to suggest is to spray this perfume or any perfume of your choice on your hair, just two quick sprays and the smell lasts much longer then on your skin. Make sure your hair is dry and styled before doing this.

I have tried Ralph Lauren's "Romance" Eau de Parfum Spray and I love its lush floral scent, so romantic and sophisticated. I use it only on very special occasions and I've often been asked: "What perfume are you wearing? It smells so good." I spray it behind my ears and wrists for a long-lasting effect. So leave a scent of you behind with                Ralph Lauren "Romance" Eau de Parfum Spray. 

A perfume that means always and forever in bloom. 

Wholeheartedly recommended.

This is a really nice little bomb, and smells of those little candy conversation hearts that come out for Valentine's day each year. Sort of tangy and light and sweet. But as with all that Lush does, there is a depth to this scent that makes it interesting enough to enjoy bathing in time and time again.

The tonka oil in it is good for helping you to forgive yourself and for relaxation, according to the first Lush Times catalog it appeared in, so whenever I am having a bad day or kicking myself for making a silly mistake, I bathe in this and feel better. It also has lavender for relaxation and neroli to uplift the spirits.

The only downside to this bomb is that the scent doesn't linger much at all once you get out of the bath, which is disappointing to me since it smells so good! Still, it is a worthy bath bomb and the cheery pink water and uplifting scent make it one I come back to time and time again

I pulled the lid of the Philosphy Vanilla Birthday Cake bottle and inhaled the wonderful smell of vanilla birthday cake.  It smells 100% like its glorious namesake.  While some people complain about feeling strange bathing in birthday cake or a strawberry milkshake, I think of it as being just another type of aromatherapy.  Cake makes me happy, birthdays make me happy, this birthday cake smelling body wash and shampoo really makes me happy!  

Plus as a bodywash and shampoo it functions very well.  My skin feels smooth, and my hair feels light, silky and not weighed down.  My hair still smells a little like birthday cake, which isn't as good the second day, but it's not overpowering.  I don't think I will use this as my everyday shampoo, but it is great to throw in a gym bag for a quick after-workout shower

       Okay, so our Moms said we shouldn't compare, but I couldn't help it once I found Sephora's Powder Brush.  It's hair and handles above all the rest.  Used to think a brush was a brush was a brush, which is probably why my "rest" includes artificial haired brushes that left powdered streaks on my face and one that shed whatever kind of hairs it possessed faster than a Sheepdog in August.

	Enough of my sad cosmetic catastrophes - this Sephora brush is made of 100% goat hair, fine and soft to pick up powder and allow you to apply either pressed or loose powder sleekly and smoothly.  Did I say it feels like silk on your skin?  It does.

	Additionally, the brush hairs are rounded rather than cut straight across so it"s quick on the "pick-up" and consistently even on the distribution.  Of course, it's good looking with a state-of-the art silver handle.  It measures 8 inches - more importantly, it measures up to everything a perfect powder brush should be.

This philosophy kit really works for people with consistant light to moderate acne. I've tried just about everything out there-prescription topicals & pills, Pro-activ, and all the over the counter stuff. I have adult acne, I never experienced acne as a teenager. When I first started using Philosophy's kit I didn't notice a huge change in the first few weeks, beyond pimples clearing up faster. Around week 5 or 6, I began to notice that I wasn't waking up to a new zit every morning and I didn't feel oily at the end of the day. Now, I have been using for 4 months and feel like a new person. I don't have to cover my face with concealer or retouch make-up throughout the day. I can walk out the door with just powder on my face for the first time in years! I would recommend this kit to anyone who can't use benzoyl peroxide and is frustrated with all the other products on the market

Hi, I just wanted to let everyone out their know: that this stuff works. 

I have had problematic hormonal acne since the age of 21. I'm 27 now. 

After I graduated from the university and started working a real job, the stress went straight to my face (you all know what I am talking about). Unfortunately for me, I am allergic to benzyl peroxide and I have extremely sensitive skin. I also do not do well with tea tree oils and most sulfur and acidic products (basically anything that can kill acne - leaves my face itchy- either swollen like a tomato or is ineffective and I have painful acne bumps...which would you rather do?).

I was a little hesitant after reading the ingredients and noticed that the cleanser had sulfur in it and there was also a jar of pure salicylic acid for blemishes. But, after using other philosophy products for my hair and body - I decided to give it a try. Hell, what's another 50 bucks if it can clear my acne - and if not I can always send it back.

I started using it about 3 weeks ago and my skin has had a tremendous transformation. I finally feel like my acne is under control. I recommend this product fully and it is my duty to tell everyone this after suffering with relentless acne for so many years. 

The cleanser is awesome and needs to be in a larger size. The blemish serum is extremely drying, so if you are sensitive like me read the directions and take it slow - don't reapply throughout the day, until your skin is ready. The day and night face creams are cool. The day one is kind of like glue and seals in the treatment - the entire day! That's why it works, because it is on your face until night time when you wash (I can even faintly smell the product). Then you use your night hydrogen peroxide cream, yes not benzyl. Yeah, this cream is intense as well. So take it slow until your skin is ready. 

One thing that I do recommend is that if you wear make-up, use the purity cleanser (not in the kit) to initially clean your skin and then use the acne cleanser. That's what I do and it works for me - so I will share it with you.

Another thing I do is I will take a little bit of the hope is not enough SPF moisturizer and put on very little on my super dry areas. Remember this acne kit is intense and you may be prone to drying out and peeling - so some oil-free moisturizer can help hydrate the area around the acne.

Well that's about it. I hope this helps you and let's you know that your acne can be tamed and doesn't have to run your life. 

Take care,
M. Rodriguez

The shade I use is Subtle Lips. I love it! It gives some color but not so much that I feel done up. I could be in complete casual clothes and throw it on and feel great. And yet it looks great on Sundays too. Because of the mild color it matches everthing. And unlike lip gloss, it's not sticky at all. (I can't tolerate any stickiness!) I am only somewhat picky about scent and taste, and to me this one has neither. I think it is by far worth the $20!!

       Glamorous, mysterious, seductive all describe Armani Code, a captivating orange blossom based scent from Giorgio Armani Fragrance.

	As one would expect from this master couturier the bottle itself is a gem.  Tapering from a weighted base the slim flacon seems to glow as lacquered shades of blue sweep from an early dawn at the bottom of the sleek holder to midnight nearing the top.  Adding to the fragrance's intrigue is an oriental effect achieved by  lace embroidery on the glass.

	The scent  is sweet yet sensuous with a sparkle provided by orange zest.  With orange blossom at its heart Armani Code is enhanced by Sambac jasmine, Madagascan vanilla and honey.  The man in my life called it "delicious," and I do, too.  It's now high on my list of favorite fragrances.

        - Gail Cook

This one could appeal to a variety of fragrance lovers as it seems to find that middle ground in preferences. It's not too spicy, not sickeningly sweet. It's not trying to do too much. Just effortless. One thing I like about this, you're not at risk at dousing yourself and offending other noses. I hate smelling or leaving a trail of perfume in the air. This one has restraint. Staying power is debatable but it's such a wonderful, confident woman scent, I gave it 5 stars

This is one of the most beautiful, sexy scents currently on the market.  If you are a gourmand/oriental fragrance lover (examples of which include Thierry Mugler's Angel or Angel Innocent, Bvlgari's Omnia, Calvin Klein's Euphoria, or Burberry's Brit - all of which I own and wear regularly without longevity issues - see next paragraph) then I would highly recommend this fragrance.  Sweet, but in a sexy, subtle musky way.  

I would bathe myself in this fragrance if I could.  And I should.  As noted by the previous reviewer, this fragrance is gone in flash.  I give myself about 5 hearty sprays of this in the morning, including two directly misted onto my clothing in an effort to extend the fragrance, but it is gone by noon.  This is truly perplexing.  Every other Giorgio Armani frangrance that I own, including Sensi, Emporio She, and Armani Code for Men (also great for women), can go the distance.  

This is supposed to be Eau de Parfum, but wears very much like Eau de Toilette.  Someone seriously skimped on the oil base.  It that doesn't trouble you terribly, pick this one up.  If you want something similar that will last through the entire day and most of the night, and particularly love the musk component of this fragrance, then I would wholeheartedly recommend checking out Narciso Rodriguez's "For Her" or "Musc for Her" instead

After seeing this in a magazine, I decided I had to try it so I ordered a small sized tub from Sephora.  OMG what an amazing change to my hair.

I am a perpetual hair dyer and last year had a perm that I then straightened because I hated it.  Top that off with living in Hawaii prior to that, and between the color, sun, and perm my hair was getting a little sad.

This stuff is amazing. From the first time I used it, my hair was shiny and very soft.  

I call it the "dirty hippy hair stuff" since it smells like incense.

I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.

If you don't want to pay the Sephora or QVC prices, buy it on ebay.  I have a found a seller there that sells the large tub for $20 cheaper than what you buy it at Sephora for

i've been using ojon for a year or so, and my hair has never been healthier.  i have long, fine, wavy hair which i flat iron about 5 times a week; this product definitely keeps your hair shiny and protected from heat damge and split ends.  hair stylists are always amazed at the great condition my hair is in being that i heat treat it so often, and i get comments all the time from friends, family, and just people i encounter about how shiny and pretty my hair looks.  the smell is distinctive (not offensive in my opinion), but you wash the product out out!  my hair smells like my shampoo/conditioner, so i really don't understand what the other posts about the smell are trying to say.  i definitely reccomend this product and do so often.

I have thick, coarse, african-american hair that is relaxed (permed straight). I usually use this product on wet hair (after a shampoo)when blow-drying my hair straight. It makes it really smooth and shiny. I have received a lot of compliments on my hair since I have started using it. In warm temperatures it does melt down but in my opinion it makes it easier to use. When it is a solid you are supposed to rub it in the palm of your hands to liquify it and then put it in your hair. It does have a smokey scent to it but no one pays attention to that...they are looking at how great my hair is. I love Ojon's conditioner (it is the very best I have ever used)but the shampoo in my opinion seems to dry my hair.

I don't know about the people who gave 1 or 2 star reviews but this product is the ONLY thing that saved my hair. I did everything from getting a curly perm to stripping the color. I used coconut oil, frequent trims, keratin treatments and NOTHING worked. My hair still kept breaking and splitting like clockwork. When I used the product, 3 treatments later and it's never been healthier. The product is very oily, so USE SPARINGLY when you use it as a gloss or leave in conditioner!

P.S. People with healthy, not-so-damaged, and normal hair do not need to use this stuff. Because if you do, you'll get silly comments from a tree-hugger that has nothing to do with the product. This product is only for heavy duty damage! By the way, the ONLY thing good from John Frieda is Frizz-Ease...

Almost immediately after using this face mask the redness in my face was gone.  It helps with a number or skin problems, and I have sensitive skin so it's hard to find a product that won't hurt me.  Most facial masks cause a minor chemical burn, this left my face beautifully soft.  If you're unsure of this product, or wavering at all, let me tell you that you should buy it, it's amazing.

This is a life-changing product if you have any issues with eye shadow creasing.  You just smooth a little of this product on your eyelids before applying eye shadow, and it provides a perfect base.  Twelve hours later, the shadow is still perfectly in place.  I bought this at a Neiman Marcus store, but the product is so good I wanted to make sure I rated it online so others would know how great it is!

I am very impressed with the whole Bobbi Brown line.  This lip gloss is no exception.  These lip glosses come in tubes with wands that have a small lip brush on the end.  The colors are fantastic.  These glosses are all very neutral, and natural looking colors.  None of these glosses are going to make you look too made up; just make you look finished.  The texture is not too tacky or sticky.  And it has a light scent, not very strong and overall its a very good lip gloss.  I highly recommend these lip glosses and will continue to purchase them.

HI

<review_text>
I have thick and very coarse hair (as you read in the title) that I am trying to grow out, and I have tried everything before to help tame the mane.  I always look for a product that not only puts back moisture into my hair, but something that can fortify it as well to prevent more damage.  I've tried almost every single intensive conditioner in the stores and tried a lot in the salons as well, however this one I came across by accident.

My aunty had gone to a Frederic Fekkai promo sale and bought a WHOLE bunch of stuff.  It didn't really do much for her hair, so she passed them on to me to try.  Some of the stuff I wasn't too impressed with, but this hair mask did wonders for my hair!

After just one use, I could totally tell a difference in the feel and texture of my hair.  Usually, I have to straighten or blow dry my hair when its wet to tame it, however this product I didn't have to do too much after.  I let my hair air dry and just put in a anti-frizz cream after, and that was good.

The mask washes out clean (no greasy residue), so this product is really good for weekly restoration.  But from what it seems like, this hair mask (along with all products, I suppose) work for some people and not for others.  Your best bet is to get your hands on a sample size before you shell out the money for a full tube, since it can be kind of expensive

I got a free sample of this product at a Nordstroms trend show and decided to use it the other day. My hair is pretty course and frizzy and long, but it is also more kinky curls instead of big, round, ringlets. Well, I let my hair air dry then applied a serum to take care of the frizz. Then I put some in my hair (you don't need much) and scrunched and twisted my hair. It worked wonderfully! My hair was bouncy and had lots of volume and was very shiny and curly, the best i have ever seen it! I got a lot of compliments on it too. The only thing is that if you use too much your hair gets too shiny and looks oily, also it doesnt have much hold at all, so a good hair spray really does the trick with this. Besides that, it is a wonderful curl enhancer

Anyone who gave this lotion a low rating simply did so because they don't realize achieving GREAT curly hair is a process. There is no ONE product that can do all the work.

I have thick, frizzy, DAMAGED, curly hair. I use this lotion after using my favorite shine serum, then after letting air dry for a few minutes finish with gel or mousse for hold.

The curl enhancing lotion really REALLY improves the look of my curls - from uneven ringlets and loose waves, to an almost universal loose big curl - it's beautiful!

The only downside is the TINY bottle for such a high price. It should be at least 8oz

Wow!  Shesheido has done it again!  I love thier products!  I have oily skin...so I like to blot my face once a day.  The papers are awesome...very soft.  They soak up the oil and I can tell after I throw the paper away.  Usually 1 sheet a day is all I need and my face is shine-free!  I love them!  I also like this product becuase you get 100 sheets which is the most I have seen so far.  I love this product and will buy again

I first got a whiff of this from a magazine enclosure.  It got me curious, as they rarely do.  Passing Sephora, I went in for a test...and felt seduced by the classy charm of the scent.  It seemed to have a rich sophistication which goes with horseback riding or polo.  After a few days, I still couldn't get the scent out of my head so I went back to grab it up.  I've only had this experience with a few other fragrences...but they were of a totally different style...Angel by Thierry Mugler and Flower by Kenzo

The perfume is very subtle with a little hint of sweetness.  It's not overpowering or musky. Don't try to sniff the bottle or a sample...it won't do it justice.  You have to try it on your skin to know how great it smells.  I've had other designer frangrances, but this is by far my favorite and I've received a lot of compliments

I order the ash color for blondes and found that it is just the right color.  I also purchased the Anastasia brow stensils with this item and finally seem to have found a solution for my thin, mismatched brow problem.  I have ordered many Bare Escentuals products and love all of them

I have tried every lip plumper on the market (no joke) and this is the best (besides pure cinnamon leaf oil, which burns like hell).  I use B.E. products and I bought a couple of these bc I liked the colors.  I was not expecting it to work as well as it did.  Now it is all I use on my lips! It makes your lips feel cool, not burning

I am new to the world of gloss and haven't tried that many brands but this is definitely on my keeper list. If you want something that plumps I would look elsewhere but if your looking for a subtle gloss that smells great and gives your lips a nice chilled feeling this is the gloss for you.

Very good product and great kind of fruity smell. leave hair soft and full of "bounce". Easy to comb hair after using this product but might be combine with Kerastase conditionner for very dry and damage hair if your hair are very long. The price here is still more expensive than in Europe: around 22 euros

I love this product - it's a lot more natural looking than foundation, and saves a step in the morning. It does a good job evening out skin tone, and it feels good on my dry skin. As someone who doesn't wear a lot of makeup, it adds that extra bit of "polish" that makes for a more professional appearance, without looking too made up

hey,

I have been using Min shampoo on/off for about six months, and can no longer go off the stuff because when I do there is  dramtic difference. As far as the smell goes, I don't need to smell like a coconut or a Bloomingsdale, just make it pleasant or oderless and give texture and fullness to my hair. I don't think it smells medicated, (unlike reviogen) but just doesn't have too strong of an oder. If more people knew of this product more people would be happier with their hair.

Let me say that this is the best skin care cream I have ever used and I know for a fact that it works because so many dermatologists stand behind it.  
I've used it for a little over a year now and I won't use anything else.  I don't know the last time I ever had to use an exfoliating scrub because what this does, is an automatic scrub.  It is gradually sloughing off dead skin cells for you and rendering the use of exfoliaters useless. 
I must say, it has a natural funky smell but you do adapt to that very quickly and won't notice it after a while.  You use it once a day for the first two weeks (while your skin gets used to it) and then twice a day thereafter if you want.  I only use it at night and a sunscreen throughout the day because the skin is a little more sensitive to the sun.
Caution - this is an acid cream.  I once had a minor paper cut on my finger (the same that I use to dip into the pot) and I still get tears in my eyes thinking of the pain I was in.  
This is an excellent cream and I strongly recommend it.  It won't get rid of wrinkles (you have to know that there is practically NOTHING on the market that will get rid of them) but it will soften the look of wrinkles and it will give your skin a beautiful softness and glow.  It's an amazing cream with true genuine results

Laura Mercier is, by far and away, my very very favorite line of lip color.  Over the years, I have tried hundreds of lipsticks, glosses, pots, pencils, you name it.  Laura's are the best. Here's why I like them:
1. Color is natural and semi-sheer so it looks light-weight, no matter what the shade
2. Colors are not garish - you won't be throwing them out next season.  Not to say that they are boring, just timeless and well thought out.
3. They last a long time.  Not all day, but I really hate those "all day" lip colors.  By mid-day, my lips are so dry and gross-flakey.  I've thrown away more of those cruddy "all day" lip colors than I care to remember.  Back to the point, my Laura lipstick easily lasts me through a 2-hour presentation to a client.
4. I only wear the Shimmer line in Fall, and guess what? Metallics are so "IN" for Fall 2005

This liner is thin as advertised, goes on easy, stays, and is really nice stuff.  Be warned, though, the lightest shade is REALLY light, and only good if you're REALLY pale.  It barely shows on me - I'm really pale with strawberry blonde hair and even I should've gone darker on the color.  Recommended

I'm nearly forty and I'm not going to give in to cellulite and wrinkles without a fight. I got this cream, and have been using it along with MBT trainer shoes and the occasional workout on an eliptical trainer. After one month, I'm starting to see results in the smoothness of my previously-lumpy legs. I can't say that it would work wonders alone, but as an add-on to an exercise program, it seems to be helping quite a lot. I've done weight-loss programs before, and they've never addressed the cellulite issue. This is the first thing that has seemed to work. And it's great moisturizer, too.

This is a very rich creme.  I find it works best for me if I use it all over my face once or twice a week.  My face breaks out if I use it more often.  I am 63 years old, so blemishes are not a common occurrence for me. Another alternative would be to use it only on the brow and under the eyes, but in that case I would recommend the StriVectin-SD eye creme which does not have the mint fragrance.

I bought some less than a week ago. I've been using it over my brows, between my eyes and under my eyes (although the directions say not to). Already the fine lines under my eyes have decreased dramatically.

I love the tingly feel of it as well. It's super expensive here in Canada ($200 a tube), but so far, it's worth the price. I'd definately buy it again

Unbelievable results, was considering Botax, when I heard about this product, thought to try. I have used several other products, never saw results like StriVectin-SD.  Used it as directed mainly between brows, on top of the lips and the neck. Within two weeks noticeable results especially around the lip area and the neck.  Have been using it for over 30 days, family and friends are noticing it.  Thank you for a great product.  Got all my friends start using.  Can't wait to try the Eye cream, just heard about it

These are great if you have oily or combination skin. Just press onto your face and it instantly takes away the oil and the shine. It won't ruin your makeup and you can use them discreetly almost anywhere, anytime. These are very similar to the blotting sheets sold by MAC cosmetics -- except these are cheaper and work just as great. I've even caught my boyfriend using it on his face so I guess it would be great for a Metrosexual. LOL!!! You'll love these as much as I do.

I have loved this product for so many years, but haven't found it for more than ten.  I flew to Spain and the Evian was an absolute necessity!  It's just the right amount of cool water as opposed to splashing water on your face out of a faucet.  It is very refreshing, and also brightens fading makeup.

I absolutely love Clinique for eye shadow. All of their eye shadows go on so smooth, never crease, and are just the perfect shades of colors for my skin tone. The Almost Peach color is great because I can use it as a highlighter under my brow or just as a base, either way I use it just about every day!  :

This scent has sweet floral undertones but with a light clean effect.  Many perfumes make me sneeze, but not this line.  I get many compliments while wearing this.  I sometimes layer it with Amazing Grace, another scent in the Philosophy line.  You won't be disappointed

I have been using this powder for about 5 years. It is amazing. I have problems with red cheeks and breakouts. Once I put on my concealer and foundation, I put on this powder and it is truly what makes my imperfections disappear. It even comes with the perfect application brush. This powder is worth every penny because it does what a powder should do

i first bought this product because the woman at the store said that it renewed the skin, bringing newer skin to the surface.  and she added that it helps pull pimples out to the surface so you can get rid of them easier, i was a little wary a first, but it works.  my skin feels softer and looks more even all around.

It helps you dry and burns the wattery thing inside your face out.
This is a non toxic device used to heat up the pimples until it get small and dry.
This product is better than Proactiv. 
Proactive does not work on my face instead it irritates and get worst.
Try to wash your face with Dove skin soap for more than 1hr to soften your face and remove the pus. Then, path it dry and use Zeno, and don't over use this product because it might hurt and burn your skin.
Failure to use this product properly might cause 1st Degree burn.

Never use any chemicals on your face while using this product.

For excessive large pimples, I see some people apply a clean duct tape on their face, keep it for 3-8 hrs and remove it.
You would notice that all pus are lying on your face and you just need to clean it using clean water and a skin soap.

The regular price of this product is $150 for 60 Treatment Cycle.

HI

I am a hair fanatic... test and try everything.  This comb is the best comb I've come across for my hair.  I have a lot of thick hair, so this comb really does the job.  I have been using Avon combs for over 5 years now and love them.  Very strong and don't break easily.  Because my hair is thick, I still need to use conditioner to help detangle it, other wise my hair would be ruined.  Worth every penny, and for $4.99, you can't lose.

For over 7 years I have been battling Adult Acne Rosacea with little success.  I have used prescribed creams, facialists, OTC products, diet changes, etc. with minimal effects.  With the onset of winter I wanted to ensure my face was moisturized with the very low humidity.  While ordering a mister from Amazon, I noticed many people also ordered the Body Shop Vitamin E Face Mist.  I thought "why not"?  The results were almost immediate! The redness and breakouts have greatly diminished and I'm once again getting comments from people on how very nice my skin is looking.  You couldn't ask for an easier application and it doesn't give my skin a claustraphobic feeling.  And, the rose water scent is revitalizing and calming.  This is the best thing I've used in over 6 years.  I wholeheartedly recommend it, especially to premenopausal women  who are experiencing skin dryness

Is there anyone who doesn't know the name Sarah Jessica Parker? Okay. Think "Carrie" on TV's enormously successful "Sex and the City." She was the gal who dressed to the nines - always with style and glamour. She brings both of those qualities to her first fragrance, "Lovely Sarah Jessica Parker." 

It's a unique, almost indescribable blend of classicism, chic, and innocence. There's not a scent like it with top notes of fresh Mandarin, Bergamot, Lavender, and Apple Martini. Vibrant and warm it's a fragrance that caresses the senses. 

Middles notes are Patchouli, tender Paper Whites, and luxe Orchid. These are enhanced by bottom notes of irresistible white amber, sensuous cedar, and the very sultry musk. This is a scent I revel in, and enjoy wearing. 

The bottle is, of course, simple and exquisite, curved with polished glass, ultra feminine. 

Lovely Sarah Jessica Parker is a beautiful, dreamy yet quite alive fragrance appropriate for every occasion. 

- Gail Cooke

eyeshadow in the world. Being new to this makeup line this kit was en excellent addition.  The colors, vanilla sugar eye shadow (a light creamy peach), fashionista liner shadow (a  rum raisin/brown),peach puff eyeshadow (creamy peach), and explore soft focus eye shadow (medium brown) all blend together so that you cannot tell where one color starts and the other begins.  Applying your bareminerals foundation first, glues it all on.  The included booklet guides you along. 

Being in my 40's, natural looking is the name of the game for me. No glitter, sparkles, heavy eye liners etc.  This kit accomplished that.  I got brave and tried the "foiling" effect and fell in love ! The colors did not migrate, the liner stayed in place for over 12 hours, and I had no eye irritation at all.

Do yourself a favor and try this out !  You will never go back to other eye makeup.  I recommend this to everyone I know, you won't be dissappointed

This is a perfect winter cream for me, and would probably work for anyone else who has very dry skin (e.g., you rub Eucerin on at night).  It is very similar to the regular cream in appearance (pink) and smell (not offensive), but it is much heavier.  I started using this during the winter when I discovered the regular cream wasn't heavy enough and it works just as well.  It spreads on pretty easily for such a thick cream and when I wake up my skin is dewy and moisturized.

As a fragrance addict I will try anything once- but I am hooked on this stuff.  I don't often purchase solid perfumes as all of the ones I have tried tend to be greasy feeling on, and don't last very long.  This is completely different- it's easy to apply but isn't at all greasy and last quite a while.  This scent is beautiful and floral/spicy and not overpowering.  If you enjoy Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker, I think you'll enjoy this too- plus you can take it anywhere- it's only as big as a tube of lipstick.  Finally, beauty habit sent me a little handwritten note of thanks and a little bag of perfume and lotion samplers with my order.  I can't wait to try the other scents by Crazylibellule and The Poppies and I would definitely shop again with Beauty Habit.

Good Stuff

I absolutely love the smell of Philosophy's Cinnamon Buns.  Like the other reviewers have said, it doesn't last long after the shower but it is a nice way to wake up in the morning.  Even my husband likes it and he is really picky about anything scented.

I only use it as a shower gel and not a shampoo so it lasts pretty long making it worth the expense.  I like the other Cinnamon Buns products also - I use the cream and the lip gloss

Like someone else said, I don't have a problem paying for a high quality beauty item that works as it says it does.  Cinnamon buns has a great lather, smells wonderful when you use it, and makes your skin soft.  

I have used it as a shampoo and the scent lingers a bit longer using it on your hair, but it really doesn't function as well as a shampoo as it does as a shower gel.  For a bubble bath ya have to use so much of it I just can't do it. I find myself counting  the ounces I'm pouring under the faucet and have decided to use it as a treat only.

The smell doesn't last very long, but have found that it does linger longer if you lather, rinse and repeat, like it says on the bottle.  

It's a dollar an ounce.....not sure if I'll try any of the other 'flavors' simply because of the cost

I have very sensitive skin, a thick beard, and must shave daily.  What a hellacious combination! The Art of Shaving for Sensitive Skin is the best shaving cream I have found...and I have been searching far and wide.  As for the rest of their products...eh, I could take them or leave them...i.e. there are similar products you can acquire much cheaper.
This shaving cream in particular has no alcohol and all kinds of natural ingredients including a bunch of non-comudegenic (sp?) oils that really protect your skin.

I have mixed feelings about Philosophy products.  For one thing they have really done a number on my skin as far as drying certain areas of my skin out.  On the other hand, I use to have a very congested skin and nose area but I have noticed a HUGE difference in the congestion of my skin when using When Hope is NOt enough serum.  I haven't noticed any lifting but the line between my eyebrows has softened.  As far as reducing facial hair growth don't count on it.  I am only giving this 4 stars because even though it has helped keep my congestion under control, it hasn't done much more than that and I think it is a bit pricy for being just an exfoliator

Philosophy products have really changed my skin, and I know this is true because the times I have run out of Philosophy products and replaced them with even very expensive department store brands, my skin starts breaking out and looking blotchy, uneven and tired.  Then I remember how much Philosophy does for me, and I absolutely have to reorder.  If you buff your face with the microdelivery peel, wash thoroughly with "Purity Cleanser", then follow with this product, "When Hope Is Not Enough Serum" then "Hope in a Jar" moisturizer on your entire face and neck, your skin will just glow, and you will be amazed how fast blemishes and blotches just go away and don't come back!  After using the microdelivery peel, my skin looks 75% better right away.  After a week of using all the products, my skin is clear and glowing.  I really believe in these products.  They feel great, smell great and work great

This products delivers what it promises.  I bought it as part of the Makeup Optional Kit and now I am ordering 2 so that I don't run out.  My skin is missing it so badly.  I discovered good skin I never knew I could have so I must have this product.  The antioxidants really deliver and roll back the years to reveal younger skin.  This is my favourite, then secondly the Purity made simple, third the Hope is not Enough SPF cream

I have been on the search for a new makeup and have been disappointed in so many, so I have been pleasantly surprised with how much I like the Pur Minerals. I sets nicely and I don't feel "made up". I like that there are no chemicals in it as I have pretty sensitive skin. This is not a heavy makeup so if you're looking for max coverage this is not for you. I love the mineral glow too. It gives me the perfect glow without looking fake. I will be buying this again

I recently converted to using powder makeup.  I am hooked. I didn't tell anyone I was using it.  My son was the first person to tell me how nice I looked!  That truly made my day and was all the convincing I needed.  I absolutely love it because it is flawless and does not feel "goopy" like liquid foundation

This Pur Minerals Starter Kit is a great introduction to this brand.  I am absolutely in love with the 4-in-1 Pressed Mineral Makeup (included in the kit). It's so much better than the Bare Escentuals makeup, which I had been using for years. The 4-in-1 provides great coverage, as it is a foundation, concealer, and spf 15 pressed powder all in one. With Bare Escentuals, I was having to buy the mineral veil, foundation and concealer all separately, and I still felt like my dark circles and blemishes were not covered well. Pur Minerals is a wonderful makeup, very lightweight, and even the brush is soft on my skin! I highly recommend it

Having been blessed with very large pores on my nose and cheeks I was looking for something that might help reduce the appearance of my pores.  They seem to enlarge as I age. Came across this product somewhat by accident. I was really amazed at how well it works. Just a small dollop tapped lightly on the skin and your pores vanish and your skin looks perfectly smooth. It mattifies the skin all day (and I have extra oily skin). Other Clinique products have made my skin break out, but this stuff is wonderful if you suffer from acne on your nose or cheeks. Highly recommended

This is the best shaving product in the whole wide world.  If you exfoliate first and then use it, nothing gets smoother legs for me & my sensitive skin. Yes, it seems kind of expensive but you just need a tiny bit at a time in a thin layer so it actually lasts longer for me than several bottles of regular shave gel.  It also takes up less space

I bought this as a gift for my head-shaving husband. He is very happy with his close shave, and I have used it as well for my legs. A tiny bit goes a long way, and it provides a very close, smooth shave. The downside is the cost; it's hard to justify that much for an everyday shaving gel.

I'm not a big perfume girl.  I mean, I love the pretty bottles and tend to store up the really antique (or antique-y looking) ones.  But I generally prefer essential oils over perfume.  That said, out of the dozens that I own, I keep three on hand at all times.  (Four if you count the little mini I got from SpaceNK)

Santa Maria Novella for rubbing on my ankles. I know it's a bit mature but it reminds me of Italy.  And monks.  
Chanel Mademoiselle because my mother always taught me to love Chanel and I just prefer that scent to the others. 
And Marc Jacobs because, to be honest, if I had to choose the loveliest, this would be it.  It's lovely and light.  Not too over powering.  Affordable.  And gets tons of compliments.  

Also comes in cute bottle.  :

If I had to choose a fragrance that was THE most feminine I've ever smelled, it would be Marc Jacobs.  Yes, it's a gardenia based scent, but definitely not your typical musty, heavy gardenia by any means.  Marc Jacobs is different in that it is a 'wet gardenia', like you're smelling a bunch of gardenias that have been swirling around in a bowl of fresh water.  Intoxicatingly alluring.

The notes of this fragrance are: Gardenia, Wild Muguet, Skin Musk, Cedar, Ginger.  The gardenia in this is faint, but lovely.  It isn't a knock-you-out strong gardenia, but very mellow and mesmerizing.  It'll follow you like a breath of fresh air, and you'll have people sniffing the air you leave behind. :)  If you've ever smelled Michael by Michael Kors, this is DIFFERENT.  Michael is not gardenia, but it is a tuberose scent.  It is very strong, creamy, heavy, and thick.  If you like Michael, you may like Marc Jacobs as your spring/summer alternative.  They're in the same family in terms of florals and such, but different in terms of how they wear.  Marc Jacobs being flowy, and Michael being heavy.  

The 1.7 oz. retails at $65, and the 3.4 oz. at $85.  It's quite expensive, but it does have that brand-name smacked on the front. :)  I think it's worth it.  The lasting power is decent.  Even when you may feel it is gone, it's not, and people will compliment you.

Try it out and see how you like it on your skin

My husband and I sat next to a woman on our flight to Prague who smelled absolutely delicious.  A asked her what fragrance she was wearing, and she replied Marc Jacobs.   I remember it was fresh and clean, and subtly floral without being overly sweet.  

 Now -  6 months later -  I came across it in Lord & Taylor, sprayed a tester on my wrist, and instantly remembered why the fragrance was so captivating.   Without more than 30 seconds of contemplation I purchased the gift set - can't wait to experience this fresh, winning scent over and over again.

For a long time I avoided anything with gardenia like a plague-it always smelled too sickly sweet to me. This perfume changed my mind completely-yes, there is gsrdenia but its very light and fresh and unlike any gardenia you've ever smelled. Try it for yourself

My boyfriend used to search online stores for the French cologne Jean Patou pour Homme because it was the only "upscale" cologne he would wear (It was awesome!). However, it is not produced anymore and is very hard to find and very expensive. He searched high and low to find a replacement, and this is it!

Sean John Unforgivable is surprisingly good. Masculine, but not too musky or cheap smelling. Now, this is all my boyfriend will wear - and I'm not complaining!

Guys - women will love how you smell when you wear this. Women - buy this for your boyfriends/husbands, but only let them wear it when they're on a date with you! :)

Anyway, it's worth the cost, and it's our new favorite.

I have to say that I was quite impressed with this fragrance. I tend to look the other way when a product receives a little too much hype or attention. I can't say that this cologne is worth a great deal of hype, but I can say that it has a pleasant and 
disctinctive odor.

The cologne is not something you would wear on a daily basis, but would go very well with a suit on a special occasion. 

On the bad side, along with the cologne's elegant odor comes a slightly feminine aroma. While I am not one to prefer a "musky" cologne I could do without smelling like a woman. An additional downside would be it's high cost per ounce... 

Overall, since receiving the cologne as a gift, I am quite pleased with adding this fragrance to my collection. Good job Diddy Daddy Puff...

I have NEVER smelled any cologne as good as this. Unforgivable is absolutely wonderful! I saw diddy on several talk shows promoting this fragrance and thought here we go... another famous person in the perfume industry - not gonna be any good. So I go shopping the other day and see a tester bottle. I had to try it. sprayed it on the little piece of paper and immediately asked the sales clerk to give me the biggest bottle they had. It is amazing. My boyfriend comes home from work, I present him with the cologne and he wasn't thrilled (not into colognes and such), but promises to try it anyway. He didn't hate it!!! And that's about as thrilled as he gets about anything, so I knew then it was a good thing. I just can't quit smelling him, his clothes, his car - everything smells Unforgivable! We went out with some friends for dinner and drinks and both of my girlfriends pulled me aside to ask what cologne he was wearing - they wanted to buy it for their guys too! Now I can't wait for the women's fragrance to come out... SeanJean DEFINITELY has a winner here

Lush makes a few products with lemon, but I think this is one of the best because it has coconut oil for deep conditioning and it is a little intoxicating with the scent of Vetivert. 

The earthy fragrance may appeal to your wilder side if you enjoy the Jungle conditioner which also contains Vetivert oil. Use this conditioner after the Daddy-O shampoo and all you can imagine you are walking through fields of lavender drinking a coconut milkshake. 

I can also recommend the Honey Trap Lip Balm and the Smitten Hand Cream. "All that Jas" is also a wonderful product for the bath.

when I first got the package delivered to me at work, my assistant and I were smelling all the products... this one made both of us scrunch our noses in distaste. But when I got home and actually applied it to my hair, it smelled nothing like the nasty old lady smell I had detected before. The reason why I have given this product 5 stars, is because I feel that this conditioner has been unfairly graded here. The conditioner is for people with curly or processed hair -- meaning, if you have straight, thick hair, this conditioner may seem like a waste of money due to the amount of product you have to apply. Also, as us girls with curly hair know, not all curly hair is equal. Some have thick, springy curls that gets curlier the shorter the cut it, while others have a thinner quality to their hair which actually gets curlier the longer it gets. I'm the later, and I think this is why this product works for me. I can understand how this may seem misleading to those with the thicker curl types, but I'm here to set the record straight on that one. I hope it helps in deciding if this product is right for you

I really like this conditioner from Lush. I wash my hair everyday, and because of this (and long soaks in the bath) my hair gets pretty dry. This conditioner is absorbed really quickly and doesn't have an overpowering scent. I am not a huge fan of coconut, but this and the shampoo makes my hair smell like a tropical cocktail which I think is really nice. I wouldn't use it every day and don't recommend it unless you have dry hair that needs a bit of extra care. I have used American Cream but I think Coolaulin is better, at least for my hair. I have thick, straight, mid-length hair. Great conditioner to make hair soft but strong, and also shiny

I really enjoyed this bomb - it was very refreshing and relaxing. It is a big bomb and I could have broken it in half  but I didn't want to risk missing a thing! So far I have been happy with my Lush purchases and my favorite bomb is Sex Bomb, but I would buy this one again or give it as a gift

After suffering from a terrible cold all week I finally succumbed to a hot bath. I had to rummage through my box filled with Lush products ( gift from a thoughtful boyfriend) when I pulled out this huge disc and broke out half while saving the other for one more bath. I didn't even know what this was called but the minute it touched the water, refreshing and invigorating essences of lemons and milky cream escaped my nose, I felt happy in an instant, it was amazing! Even thought my nose refused to recognize scent for days I smelled the oils and citrusy botanicals, the bath water filled with tiny bubbles and I soaked my cold and stress away. 

After the bath I felt great, my skin and bones felt refreshed and I was warm, cozy and felt a lot better. After looking it up online I was really surprised to see that this was called The Happy Pill, because it really did make me happy. I am really looking forward to using the other half, hopefully when I'm not sick anymore. Once again Lush came through for me with the products they so lovingly create and I cannot recommend their bath bombs enough. Whether taken as a fun bath product or to relieve cold or sadness they always work in gentle and relaxing ways.

The main ingredients in this little love ball are good skin nourishers such as Olive oil, Hemp oil, Grapefruit oil, Bergamot oil, Frankincense oil, Lemon oil, Grange Flower Absolute, Mandarin oil, Gardenia Extract ( yum!) and sodium bicarbonate.

Happy Bathing!

- Kasia S.

Olive oil moisturizes while grapefruit, lemon oil and mandarin orange oil refresh. This is a large foaming bath treat that looks like a big fizzy orange vitamin pill that you put in water. It seems to foam slowly and eventually I broke it into pieces to help the process along. It kept fizzing and foaming creating tiny orange and yellow islands within the bubbles (I added some bubble bath first - you might want to try some Happy Hippy shower gel). 

Eventually the water turned creamy (olive oil and hemp oil) and this bath reminded me of a creamsicle. Bergamot, orange flower and gardenia also make this a beautiful calming bath that leaves you in a good mood. 

This bath is fun with the Lemslip Buttercream. I keep applying some "Whoosh" temple balm to my wrists and happily inhaling deeply. This bath made me feel warm and snuggly and in the mood for lemon meringue pie or lemon sugar cookies or lemon tea. 

This is a good bath for the morning or evening, depending on your mood. I was drinking Celestial Seasonings Tension Tamer Extra with this LUSH experience. If you love "Happy Hippy" shower gel, this fun bath product will impress you.

I tried the apple cider clarifying shampoo on a reccomendation from a saleswoman at Sephora.  I have never been happier with a shampoo.  I have fine/ oily hair and product buildup is a problem for me.  After using this, it felt like I just left a salon.  My hair was shiny, squeaky clean, it had body and was sooo soft.  I also got several comments from people at work about how good my hair smelled. I only use it about once a week, not only to conserve (it is pretty pricey per ounce), but also it's clarifying so I don't want to dry out my scalp (this has happened to me before).  So I shampoo and condition with other products during the week

Much better in terms of coverage than the new Loreal makeup that Diane Keaton touts, which is more creamy but just doesn't cover as well.  Avon's mousse foundation goes on almost like a powder but doesn't block my pores.  I highly recommend it

This product blended well into my skin, and I forget that I was wearing makeup. What is amazing about Avon is that their products are very economical and yet is of very high quality. I am usually acne-prone so I am careful about what I use on my face. It is not oily and yet even dry skins can use it. It is very matte and can be worn alone

This stuff smells awesome.  I have it on my bathroom sink and it makes my whole bathroom smell like candy.  I haven't used it yet because I love the smell so much and I don't want it to go away.  I just ordered a bunch though, so I will try it out.  They are really pretty too.  If I was a kid and didn't know any better I would probably try to eat it

If you love baths, but simply must have bubbles, then the bubble bars can be a lovely addition to a salt soak. You can also add one of these or half of a bubble bar along with one of the bath bombs. I keep buying the bath bombs and giving them away as gifts, which is an excuse to buy more lush products! 

I've tried numerous bubble bath products and these seem to produce an especially fun amount of bubbles. You can literally hide below the bubbles, there are so many. You also get the added benefit of more essential oils. With Lush products, you may have to get a journal just for bath bliss experiences. There are certain products you can blend together to create moods and moments.

This is my favourite Lush bubble bar. It makes lots of bubbles and is good for 2 very decadent baths. It can be divided into 3 or even 4 baths, but I like lots of bubbles so I usually divide into 2 baths. It smells like vanilla candy and is wonderful. The smell usually lingers a lot longer in the bathroom than it does on me. I have a dark blue tub so can't really see if the water changes colour. I think if it does, it can only be a faint pink. It has a strong smell but I think that's part of why I love it so much. The candy flower on top can be pink, blue, yellow, or white. If you like this I would also recommend you try Melting Marshmallow Moment, which is a bath melt (ie no bubbles) but it's also really yummy, and a lot more skin-softening. This can also be divided into at least 2 baths, and still be indulgent

This powder provides excellent coverage without being thick.  (Thick powder base is horrible - it always looks like you dunked your face in a bowl of flour.) My freckles are still there, but my skintone is more even.  It did its job of concealer very well - no red spots, no dark circles - and it works very well as a foundation/powder.  Much better than any other powder foundation I've ever used.  Come to think of it, much better than any liquid foundation I've ever used

China Glaze is my favorite polish, but perhaps it's because they are the only ones I've ever seen with this color #86, Your Touch. It's so gorgeous, I've had compliments on it nearly every place I go. China Glaze seems to have limited retail distribution, so I've had to order it online for years - and this vendor was perhaps the best ever in sending it out so quickly! Great job

I bought this because I wanted a primer for make up, but have acne prone skin and felt that most other primers would make me break out, as some reviews have stated. Initially I did break out a little, but I kept using it becuase the rest of my skin looked so great and felt so smooth. After a week the breakouts went away (they were minor) and all I can say is WOW. My skin looks so much better, my make up looks better, I look better without make up, etc. etc. I use it with Complete Me powder foundation and I have never in all my 38 years been happier with a pair of products.

I LOVE this stuff!  I have "my mother's hands" as my sister calls them.  As the years go by they're getting more and more wrinkly and I also have age spots.  I gave some to my sister last year and now she's got me buying it too!

This hand cream makes my hands smooth and silky feeling without being greasy.  It's also improved the condition of my cuticles in only a few applications.  

I'd highly recommend it to anyone who has dry hands and cuticles.  You'll love it too

seriously. at first I thought it may be too harsh (this from someone who has skin that can take a beating!) but after awhile I found it not harsh enough! what I do now is apply it to dry skin for a more intense scrub -- trust me, this stuff truly is wonderful

I am highly sceptical myself when it comes to skincare products.  I received this as a gift after trying the mask of magnaminty (also good).  I was blown away by how this product made my skin feel.  I have used every product under the sun and am a regular proactiv customer.  This scrub was great for my oily skin and left it feeling really clean and soft.  I am totally hooked!  You will love it too...totally worth the money

The best thing about this product is that there is a numbing agent.  Apply and leave on the skin for about 20-30 seconds and then your skin begins to numb slightly, then you start shaving.  It's great because you don't feel the razor on the skin as much; which makes shaving quite pleasant. 

I've searched for other shaving cream on the market with this numbing feature and the closest is Anthony Logistics which I don't think as nice as Philosophy Common Man.

A little goes a long way when you shave and so the tube lasts quite long. I would buy this again...

I received this product as a X-Mas gift this year. I really do like it, considering the last two Philosophy products I did not care for (The Gingerbread Man Bodywash and Amen Cologne). Out of the tube, it's a little thick, but you only need a thin layer to do the trick. It offers up a nice smooth shave, and my skin feels soft and moisturized afterward. Definitely a keeper..

This stuff is fantastic1 It smells and looks like mint chocolate chip icecream (too bad it doesn't taste like it). It cools and sooths the skin while exfoliateing away the dead skin. I keep mine in the fridge as an extra cool treat

When you buy this perfume for your girlfriend, don't tell her it was under 40 dollars!  I don't know why people make a big deal over expensive perfume.  Yeah, like it really smells better just because it's more expensive.  Anyway, Sarah Jessica Parker perfume has a really nice scent that you'll want to smell over and over.  It's nice that you don't have to spend a lot of money on it either.  Add just a touch for proper use

I got the Gift Box.  I love it.  It smells very modern and you can layer it with a sugar or a vanilla to make your own blend.  It smells "money" - because it is so sophisticated - I love how it wears, it gets nicer as the evening goes on.  I like that in a scent.

Once again, spending a little more money for a product that does what it advertises is WORTH it. This is the only toner I have ever used that completely diminishes oil and shininess without over-drying my skin. I alternate with #3 depending on the weather

If you're like me and your scalp itches like crazy after you get your color done, Nioxin System Scalp Therapy is the answer. (The numbers only represent the type of hair you have, use a lower number if your hair is more fine.)

Use this once or two times after color, and the scalp itch goes away. 

The product claims to help thinning hair. I have no issue with that, and I think I found an "off-market" use for the product, but it works for me so I'll take it

This is a really fun gift for children (although, you might have guessed that I like them too), it has a sweet fruity scent without being a sugar buzz and the colors are very bright and cheerful.

I would suggest one of those wire or slotted soap dishes to help these dry easier and faster though. A regular soap dish without any type of draining makes it melt faster

Whenever I saw glass or porcelain nail files in stores I always thought they were overpriced, you can get all kinds of nail files for a couple of bucks, and I didn't see a reason to pay more.  But I was given one of these and now I think it's worth it.  It is a really strong file, so strong that my mother was startled by how much it took off the first time she used it.  You really only need very gentle pressure and speed with this type of file.  It is very easy too clean and shows no signs of wear, by this time I usually would have killed a normal file

I wasn't crazy about this mascara when I first put it on but it grew on me. The brush is not a regular mascara brush and it took a little getting used to however I love it now. It brushes the clumps right off your lashes as you apply. They'll be long and nicely separated. And the stuff stays on your lashes like glue all day. No smearing and it still looks perfect at the end of the day to the point where I feel like it's a shame to wash my eye makeup off. I'm really pleased with it. I want to try Lancome's new mascara too but this one is definitely a keeper.

Mistral, as many know, is a powerful, gusty wind that blows across the south of France. Mistral, as I was happy to discover, is also the name of a line of bath and body products, all French inspired, all lusciously lovely from scented soaps to soothing lotions to rejuvenating body butters. 

Matthew Tilker, founder and president of Mistral, utilizes Shea butter, which is an efficacious natural healer, in a myriad of must-have forms. Derived from the nuts of the African Shea Tree (according to sacred custom the nuts are harvested primarily by women), this butter is highly emollient, a boon for those with dry skin, chapped lips, any number of skin irritations. 

The pure Shea Butter soap comes in a plethora of inviting fragrances, all milled six times (while others boast being triple milled). South Seas is a particular favorite - it's as fresh as an ocean breeze and as calming, soothing as a tropical island. The marine scent is accented with a touch of grapefruit, white flowers and soft woods. An irresistible combination. 

South Seas is a fragrance with which you wish to surround yourself - made possible by the shower gel, body lotion, massage bath and body oil, bath salts and candle all available at very accessible prices.

The pores of the face become clogged with makeup, cremes, sunscreens, Bronzing Gels, Powders, etc.  

Exfoliation, washing, facials, steaming DO NOT REMOVE BLACKHEADS, WHITEHEADS AND CLOGGED PORES.  

This simple product gets them out!  

Buying one will last a life time.  No need to buy another ever....

I took this supplement for 6 months and I noticed a dramatic change in hair appearance, length, and my nails!! I would like to keep taking it, but I can't afford it for a while, which I am really bummed out about it. I definitely recommend this product. It also has a huge celebrity following and now I know why

I can't say enough good about this lipstick.  I am a Black woman with a light-skinned golden brown complexion, like Halle Berry.  When I received the Malibu Peach my first impression was that it was too light and that my lips were going to look ashy.  However, when applied it is the perfect smooth sheer soft peach color.  It's a very rich product and the case is elegant. It doesn't have that funky smell or taste that a lot of lip products do and it's not sticky!!  I love MAC but if my hair blows into my face it sticks to my lips (eww).  Big ups to Mally! (thumbs that is..lol) I will definitely be trying some other Mally products.  I also ordered the brow kit in Sable which is first rate

I have used Philosophy products for over a year now and am a proponent of their exfoliators and cleansers.  I enthusiastically bought The Present after seeing it as a new product at the Nordstrom counter.

The bottle says that it is clear makeup for fine lines, wrinkles, and uneven texture.  It can be used three different ways; alone as an oil-free moisturizer for sensitive skin; over oil free moisturizer (such as Hope in a Jar) to create the illusion of airbrushed skin; and under foundation for a smooth finish.

I was after that airbrushed skin, and this product works GREAT if used over moisturizer.  It truly does minimize pores and fine lines. If you don't like to wear a lot of makeup, it gives you a very fresh and natural look.  

Unfortunately, no matter how diligent your are, sometimes blemishes pop up and you have to use foundation.  The Present was not suitable in this function for me.  Used under my foundation, my makeup felt cakey, thick, and the foundation did not blend well into this product.  It left unsightly foundation streaks that were difficult to correct.  I could not hold my MAC foundation responsible, because used alone it does not exhibit any of these qualities.

I would highly reccomend this product as "clear makeup" but not as a foundation primer as indicated on the back of the bottle.  If you are looking for a foundation primer, I would reccomend Smashbox's Photo Finish.  It is extremely lightweight, blends well with foundation, and the bottle will last forever because you use such small amounts.

I was given this product as a gift, and I just love it.  I'll often wear it on weekends without any additional makeup.  It smoothes this skin surface.  True - the coverage is not the same as with a tinted foundation - but it offers a lot of improvement worn alone.  Also, I was using a tinted cream makeup base that was not working well on my dry skin.  It would create lines, etc.  So I started combining the two things - the tinted cream base and the Philosophy skin perfector together on a sponge before applying and BINGO - This solved the problem.  So if you want a tint plus the smoothness, you might want to give this a try.

I have been using this powder for about 5 years. It is amazing. I have problems with red cheeks and breakouts. Once I put on my concealer and foundation, I put on this powder and it is truly what makes my imperfections disappear. It even comes with the perfect application brush. This powder is worth every penny because it does what a powder should do

I first tried Amazing Grace a couple of years ago.  At that time I had a dresser full of department store colognes.  The scent of Amazing Grace is somehow undescribable.  Suffice it to say, it is the "perfect" fragrance, and those other scents are history.  It is pleasing to the person who wears it, and is pleasing to someone just walking by you.  Some perfumes walk into a room before the person does, or is so strong it makes other people's eyes water.  We've all been around someone like that. Not so with Amazing Grace. It is just in harmony with you and those around you

I hardly ever wore a fragrance until I received Amazing Grace as a Christmas present.  I love it.  It is clean and sensual.  Whoever says this smells like a granny must have a strange sense of smell.  There's nothing granny about it.  It is never overpowering

I TOTALLY disagree with the reviewers that say it smells strong and like a granny! I don't know what they're smelling, but obviously it's not this. It does smell a little stronger at first than it does when the fragrance has settled in, but it certainly doesn't smell like any granny I've ever smelled. I always get compliments when I wear this fragrance (which is every day)- complete strangers will come up to me and tell me how good I smell. I recommend starting with the body emulsion and then lightly spritzing the fragrance (1 spray should do the trick).

A spearmint top note, a lemon middle, and a clean bottom. Patrick wore this (yes, it's great on manly men too) when we ran a half marathon last week and my nose followed him all the way to the finish line. A truly unusual and pleasurable scent. It's green, but not in the obvious chypre leafy modern sense like Chanel's Crystalle. Nope, this is mint like julep. I've never been the biggest Guerlain fan--I've left the Shalimar-isms to my grandmother, who is ravissante in those old fashioned Orientals...but Guerlain's splendid Aqua Allegoria line--which includes Herba Fresca and the equally divine Pamplelune (a grapefruit and chamomile burst), among others--is truly fresh. I get lots of compliments when I wear Herba Fresca

	Ever notice how many good things are juicy?  Juicy steaks.  Nothing tastes better, even though the price can be outrageous.  Juicy gossip.  Really, you can tell me; I never, ever repeat what I'm told!  

	Ah, and then there's the fresh, frisky, fruity "I Love Juicy" shampoo from Lush!

	This is a thick, rich jelly shampoo that absolutely whisks away city dirt or country soil with a dollop and one shampoo.  Infused with mango, pineapple, kiwi and papaya it not only leaves hair squeaky clean, but also smelling divine with an appealing fruity scent.  Give those perfumed shampoos to a rival (she'll be stunned when you're nice to her) and go for the fresh!

	Let me know how much you love Juicy.  Oh, and if you've heard something juicy - send it along.   Remember, I won't tell a soul!

If you have dry skin on your feet these socks are fantastic.  I place mine in the microwave for 15 seconds while I apply moisturizer to my feet.  Slide the socks onto your feet as soon as the microwave is finished.  In 15 minutes you have a quick, but effective moisturizing treatment.  If your feet are really dry you could do the same thing but leave them on overnight.  I found the overnight option to be a little warm on my feet.  But, it might work fine for you.

These socks are 94% cotton and 6% Spandex.  They can be machine washed and tumbled dried.  I have not found it necessary launder them each time I use them.  I use a light moisturizer (Kerasal), so you might have a different experience if you use a heavier product to moisturize.

I would highly recommend this product.

I have frosted hair that is generally on the dry side.  The problem with most conditioners I've tried is that if they are good enough to get out the knots in my hair and soften it, they are very heavy and weigh my hair down.  I found out about Kerastase at my beauty parlor and can only get it there or at Amazon.  It's wonderful, doing everything I need, including making my hair nice and shiny, without the heaviness.  I recommend it highly

I've suffered most of my life from the "dark circle" syndrome. It's become much worse at nearly 35 years old with FOUR kids! A dear friend in the industry (my personal guru!) recommended this. It is NOTHING short of AMAZING! I wear it with just a tinted face lotion (foundation makes our wrinkles stand out as I now know) and once in a while a quick dust of bare minerals clear mineral veil. My husband commented (in only two days, which is a RECORD for him) that I must have slept well because my face looked so good. This stuff is SOOOO worth the price. I'll NEVER be without it again!

I am very glad with my purchase. It gives a subtle natural glow to skin not a tacky shiny one. I am usually not very comfortable with wearing foundation and I prefer tinted moisturizers. Happy Light gives even complexion without being heavy. It also offers sun protection, SPF 15. If you don't need more than medium coverage, it is worth considering this brand.

I've been wearing Philosophy's Falling in Love as a regular fragrance and liked it so much that I decided to give some of their other products a try... Pure Grace has been a lovely find! I spray a little on a blouse or jacket and have that lovely fresh-washed scent lingering all day. It compliments the Falling in Love scent nicely, as both are fairly light, but I love it on its own as a nice change of pace as well. So far it has been just as advertised-- clean, soapy and crisp-- and I'd add that it's just one of the most comforting smells around... makes me want to curl up in a pile of warm towels fresh from the dryer and take a little nap

I have been searching for what seems like forever for a nice cologne or perfume that is not all flowery and overpowering. Now I have finally found it! I love this scent! It just smells so clean and fresh. I'm so glad I tried it! The first couple times I wore it, I received compliments and questions about what was I wearing. That never happened to me before. So I went and purchased the lotion and shower cream too. The only bad thing about it is that, like many others have said, the smell doesn't last too long and so I keep reapplying it. Maybe now that I have the lotion too, the smell will last longer. I would highly recommend trying this fragrance. I think you will love it

The charcoal in this soap acts as a sort of rasp for exfoliating dead skin cells. The licorice extract soothes and rehydrates. This is a very good soap if you have minor break-outs or oily skin. If you are very sensitive, you might want to try Fresh Farmacy instead (it has calamine lotion.)

Wowzers!

I am a 26 year old male with skin from the devil. It's so oily that only two minutes out of the shower my nose is already greasy. I have been using Fresh Farmacy 1x or 2x daily for the past two months or so and have been thouroughly impressed. A week ago I bought a bar of Coalface out of curiosity. I had read about it on the LUSH website and was somewhat skeptical. I was told at the store that Fresh Farmacy would be the better bet for my kind of skin, and I figured the slightly higher pricetag on the FF meant that it was better than Coalface. Now, having used Coalface for the past week, I can say for sure that my skin feels cleaner and tighter with Coalface than it generally has with FF.

I'm not about to toss out my remaining FF of course! It lasts forever and I probably have another 6 or 7 months of it left. I find it to be a great skin cleanser. So far, though, I think Coalface is the better choice for me.

Give this stuff a try

I recieved a sample of this bar with a large shipment of Lush products I ordered around Christmas, I gave most of the products as gifts so I full enjoyed the Samples no matter how freaky they sounded I loved this bar it smelled clean and was fun to use and even though I have combination skin that usually is dry that time of year, I did not notice any drying out and it cleared all problem areas up especially black heads! I strongly recomend this bar for any one with any problem areas. I wish I could talk more of my friends into using Lush products because their simply is the perfect miracle product for everyone to be found among them. And how fabulous are those bath products simply heaven

I love Auqolinas first and ground breaking perfume "Pink Sugar"  to death but it is such an overpowering scent that I am often smelled before I am seen and perhaps such a strong sweet scent isnt always appropriate.

Aquolinas new perfume "Chocolovers" is similarly sweet, but much subtler.

If you love the sweet scent of Pink Sugar but don't like how you can be smelled from 12 feet away, try Chocolovers

I bought this, mostly because of how obsessed I am with Pink Sugar.  This product smells sweet.  It smells like you rubbed yourself with a box of truffles before you left the house.  I personally think of this as a good thing- I love candy/food scents.  My perfume collection is such that I am suprised I'm not followed everywhere I go by a swarm of bees.  

If you're looking for a sophisticated scent, please don't buy this, or Pink Sugar.  If you are looking to have people ask, "Hey, do you smell a delicious cake?" everytime you walk past...buy away.  And who doesn't want to smell like a delicious cake?

'Don't know what these others are talking about. Chocolovers smells yummy!  What's great about this fragrance is that it's not overwhelming and it's not going to make you smell like dessert. It's got chocolatey tones but it's not just about chocolate; It's warm and musky with orange oil, hazlenut, vanilla...  If in doubt, you can always go to Sephora and try a sample first (see Sephora.com for store locations)

This is the very BEST hairstyler and hair dryer in one! I have very fine, thick, shoulder lenght hair and was a little skeptical that this product would be usefull for me. It is! Actually it is the best hair styling product I have ever purchased. It dries and sets my hair very quickly, usually in five minutes or less. What a timesaver. I am so delighted with this product that I purchased eight (8) to keep in my closet so I don't have to hunt for the best product EVER!!!

This is really good smelling cologne.  I hardly use it anymore though because of its current popularity. Gio may be the most popular cologne out there.  I would much rather be original than one of the herd.  You'll have to make the decision yourself be original or smell like everyone else

Giorgio Armani is know for his excellence and fineness when it comes to his clothing, accessories, bags and of course: Fragrances. Acqua di Gio is remarkable, distinguished, and flawless in every sense. It has been the best-selling cologne since its release and has become synonymous with sexy. 99% of people (men and women) who come in contact with you on the daily basis will compliment you on your smell (at least in my case.) I'm not complimented on any cologne I own more than this one so I usually wear it when I know I'll be in contact with more than a few people. This fragrance is truly awe-inspiring and it proves once again that when it comes to delicate scents, Armani is king

I use to be a huge Calvin Klien fan until I came across this product. I've been wearing it since 2000, and have not been without it since.  The ladies, love the scent, which is obvious as I've had women, come up and sniff me in public (Yes, public and then be excused when asking me what brand of cologone I have on).

 Forget bout those axe and tag promo's, in the real world, this is the stuff that get you remembered, not just noticed.

...every home should have some! There is no greater soap for beautiful scent, gentle cleansing and a unique ability to comfort and pamper. A perfect gift and a must in posh, top notch hotels etc. Some scents are universal while others distinctly feminine, either way they are worth a try and well worth the buy

I LOVE Lola lip gloss, it isn't too tacky, lasts a long time, and the colors are gorgeous.  I bought the Fantastica color as a key chain lip gloss several years ago and was so impressed with it that I bought La Petite Menagerie as a replacement.  I love the idea of having it on a key chain, so your never without lip gloss!  All the colors in this kit are great.

This mascara goes on beautifully and looks great, but it's messy. It's more liquid than most mascaras and, when I travel with it, the tube leaks! It also tends to smear when I first put it on, but after it dries, it's good for the day. If you carry mascara with you or travel often, look for another brand

I'm always skeptical of "age defying" products, but this one really works.  I've been using it since it first came out (maybe 10 years?) and people often think I'm younger than I am (27).  I'm not really using it for that though - I use it because it is unreal how good it is with acne.  It prevents breakouts and also heals current pimples SO fast.  When I run out, the breakouts are back

WOW! My husband and I both use this scrub. It is very refreshing. The salt scrub is easy to apply and leaves a nice minty smell in the shower and on the skin for at least an hour! Like the previous review I feel the chill after getting out of the shower...then I was full of energy! I look forward to trying this one after a hot work out or yard work! This will be a staple in our household!

I recieved this as a gift and have always loved other products by Philosophy.  This is GREAT for a hot, sticky day and you want to jump in the shower, exfoliate, and cool off.  The first time I used it, I have to admit I was freezing after my shower!  It has a very strong cooling effect that lasts on the skin for at least an hour. The smell is very natural, not artificial like a few other of Philosophy's 3in1.  It's a combo of mint and wintergreen..  I would compare it to their Candy Cane scent.  I've been using it reguarly after workouts & it's great!!  A nice cool down

I recently realized that while my wife spends hundreds on high quality skin care products for us, I was still using throw away razors.  I recently received a Fusion razor and loved that, until I went to replace the blades.  $4+ a piece, and they last no longer than any other blade.  So, I got online and researched shaving and what I learned was that, though there have been advances in shaving technology, nothing has been improved, only made more expensive.  I learned my dad was right; all it takes for a great shave is a good safety razor, a decent brush, shaving soap and a mug.

I received my razor a couple of days ago and now, I wake up eager to take a shower and shave.  Nothing has ever cut this close without giving me razor burn.  My skin is sensitive and I have had no problems with that since getting this amazing razor.  It was worth the price, too, because it is the same cost as 4 sets of Fusion replacements.  The replacement blades for this razor are fifty cents a piece and do a far better job.  

I have read reviews for this razor by people who, apparently, weren't trained to shave.  This razor will not cut against the grain.  Also, the handle is weighted, so you have to allow the razor to do all the work, or you run the real risk of filleting your face.  Be patient.  A great shave takes a little more commitment than just breaking out a can of foam and a disposable razor.  Let the razor do the work.  I assure you, even if it takes a few days to get the technique down, you will be thrilled with this razor.

The nicest feature of this amazing razor is that it allows you to adjust the closeness of the blade. I learned that most people like it between one and one and a half.  Mine is set at one and a half and it gives me a perfect shave every time. Until now, I didn't know that such a thing was even possible.  Happy shaving

The quality and workmanship is top notch! The price is high for a razor, but it will take you less than a year to break even if you are buying cartriges like the Gillette Fusion at $4 a pop! And it will last you a lifetime.  Replacement blades for the razor run about 50 cents each and last a hole lot longer! I was only getting 4-5 shaves from a Fusion blade, but I can shave my face and head for at least 2-3 weeks on a single safey razor blade :) Even if I changed the blade after every shave it would still cost less than a fusion. 

It takes some getting used to. I got a few minor nicks when I first started using it, but now I never get any.  I even shave my head with it :)  I've had mine for about 6 months and love it.

I suggest starting out on the #1 setting and work your way up. For me right between 1 and 2 is best, any higher and the shave is too close.

The strawberry milkshake shower gel smells just like Bonomo turkish candy I bought when I was a kid. I like it but I think the shower gel is overrated due to exposure on QVC.  Other shower gels are creamier than this. I'll enjoy using this and the Eggnog then go back to making my own

This is one of my favorites. I love the scent. It doesn't smell like fresh strawberries because it's not supposed to. It's supposed to smell like a strawberry milkshake (and I think they did a good job of it - so this is what I expected). Philosophy does a good job of matching the scent to the name. The only thing I didn't expect was that I still need to condition with another conditioner. I'd say it's a shampoo and shower gel, a 2-in-1, not a 3-in-1

Like I stated in the title, this isn't my FAVORITE three-in-one product from Philosophy.  I have several of their scents, and I really love Cinnamon Buns and some of the chocolatey ones.  

Strawberry Milkshake smells nice, but it is very sweet.  I wouldn't say it smells artifical, but it doesn't smell like fresh strawberries, either.   I have used it as a shampoo/conditioner quite often, and I have no issues with it.  I have fine hair, and it didn't leave me with tangles, like some of the other reviewers have complained about.

i find these soaps to be very good. There are actually 4 different kinds I believe one also for sensitive skin. If someone felt a none clean feeling afterwards,perhaps they are not taking their makeup off with the proper product, or they are using the wrong soap for their skin type. This soap is similiar to DHC soaps from Japan. If they are to drying try using the correct soap. For help I would suggest going to the Clinque counter or ask me.

Everything is fine, except I was a bit irritated by shedding...it leaves bristles on my face, and they get into the razor.  I hope it will pass with time, as other reviewers reported.  Foaming action is very good, and badger bristle is much more pleasent to the touch than boar.

I'll report again on this item in few months

This shaving brush is perhaps the most inexpensive way to get a pure Badger bristle shaving brush. I've now been using it for a year and a half, and it has not shed any real amount of its bristles like the cheaper brushes on the market. The brush head remains densely packed and quite soft. Hopefully, it will remain that way for some time to come. In the meantime, I do enjoy the close and comfortable shaves that are aided by this brush. Because of it, I have sworn off of canned shave gels for every situation except travel. They just can't compare to your average $1.50 cake of shaving soap and this brush. This was a very worthwhile purchase for me

If memory serves, noted designer Giorgio Armani was once quoted as saying that his designs were created not to be noticed but rather to be remembered. A wonderful thought, typifying his always elegant, classic style. It's certainly true of his latest fragrance for men - Black Code. 

This is a subtle, sensual scent with a touch of the oriental found in notes of lemon and bergamot. It's an ultra masculine fragrance, difficult to capture yet impossible to ignore. 

True to Armani's vision, the glass bottle is artfully crafted - a cylinder of the deepest blue. It's gift boxed in the same color with printing in gray and white. Available in 1.7 and 2.5 oz. sprays, Black code is sure to take its place by the side of Armani's always popular Gio and Mania.

after buying some lush products from here, i went into the lush store in pasadena where the staff was awesome and totally helpful. after explaining my horrendous hair issues, they gave me some samples of rehab, retread and big and i bought a bottle of american dream. they all work wonderfully. rehab made my scalp tingly and my hair felt so soft. my hair has literally never felt better. i HIGHLY recommend rehab or any lush products for that matter

One sudsy washing of your hair seems enough, but you may be tempted to wash your hair again. The suds in the Lush products are especially sensuous and fun. Baths and Showers have never been as fun as when you use these products. LUSH shampoos and conditioners are above a salon quality and also contain natural ingredients and scents that are beyond deluscious. This shampoo goes a long way so you can use a lot less. 

This shampoo contains seaweed, enzymes for cleaning and essential oils to detoxify your scalp. This product also contains a lovely helping of pineapple, kiwi and mango juice. The peppermint, rose, lavender, almond, rosemary, olive and jojoba oil are especially healing. If there is a more perfect shampoo, I haven't found it. This shampoo is a true dream and contains everything you want for deep cleansing and scalp refreshing.

For softly scented and highly conditioned locks, use this conditioning shampoo and finish off with the American Cream. The entire bathroom will be scented and the fragrance will drift through the house. You will awake the next morning and your hair will still be wonderfully scented with Egyptian musk, honey water, vanilla, sage and lavender.  The conditioner also contains fresh strawberries.

I have dry, unmanagable, curly hair and rehab has done wonders for it!

Because all the lush shampoos don't contain any silicones, it takes about one or two weeks for your hair to get used to it. The squeeky feeling described in the other review is because of the lack of silicones, this feeling disappears however when your hair dries up. Since I use Rehab my hair is bouncy, soft and shiny. Especially great in combination with American Cream conditoner (just love that scent!

I received a sample of this mascara (in black) and just love it.  It's perfect for everyday wear as it's not too dramatic and is very long lasting.  In fact, it's so long lasting that I  even took a nap while wearing it and it didn't smudge at all.  I was pleased to find, however, that it came off very easily with my Clinque Rinse-Off Foaming Cleanser, so there was no need for a separate eye-make-up remover.  I have more expensive mascaras than this and they are not as good.  Definitely a great product

I REALLY like using this product. The color powder is very sheer and the shimmer powder adds just a subtle amount of sparkle. I like using this after I have applied a light amount of foundation in place of a powder which normally makes my face look older. The shimmer powder doesn't cake like ordinary powders do and gives my face a fresh look.

Awesome product - best concealer I've ever used.  It is lightweight and does not settle into the under eye "creases" that my almost 50-year-old eyes have.  The pink undertone brightens and lightens.

This lip gloss is great.  Not only does it taste great, the initial stickiness goes away after a few moments and stays on longer than most other glosses.  Definitely a must have for anyone's make-up bag

I love Lemon Curd so I was quite happy to discover Philosophy's Frozen Lemon Custard Lip Shine.  The consistency is quite thick and coats the lips well.  This is by far my favorite Lip Shine scent

Yum! Fond childhood memories and sweet almost guilty pleasure is created whenever I use this. It smells wonderful. Deliciously scented bubbles blossom on my mesh sponge. This shower gel cleans well without being harsh to sensitive skin. I don't like it as a shampoo as much. When I do use it to wash my hair, I'm sure to follow up with a conditioner. It's a delightful product and I'm pleased with my purchase

Unless you have super oily skin and cannot tolerate any super moisturizing potions, you shouldn't use this. I have oily/normal skin and find that even this dry lotion is moisturizing enough for me. It is definitely not for dry skins and or sensitive types. Kinerase products are touted for their ultra sensitive ingredients, but beware, this lotion contains retinyl palmitate which can in fact irritate your skin. Though this does seem to deliver some skin smoothing, it is not in my opinion, as good as the cream version which is much better at balancing skin, and does NOT contain the retinyl palmitate. Both are good, but Kinerase Cream is better

OK, here's the deal.
I hate chemicals. 
I am a health nut.
I hate greasy moisturizers.
I love to get the most out of everything I do... you know that NY or 90's philosophy of multi-tasking or "Why do 1 thing when you can do 2"?
The solution is Kinerase... realtively chemically good... if it wipes off on the baby when we hug it's no biggy. 

I think the worst thing in it is Methylparaben... which is in everything, even baby products so whatever... and I can moisturize while I get a serious healthy skin glow on my face that does not quit!

I think it's made for wrinkles but I am not worrying about that yet so I use it for the clear skin glow thing that I have always wanted... the skin of my dreams! 

I barely use skin makeup anymore because my once "icky" skin (that's a clinical term) has been literally TRANSFORMED!

BUY! BUY! BUY! I kid you not... it's worth every penny.

Mally's Shimmmer, Shape & Glow is the best!!! I love the colors and she gives you an instructional guide that aids you on how to apply the shimmer shape and finally the glow.  This girl knows what it takes to help you look like JLo or Beyonce' on the street.  I cannot count how many times people have stopped and said how much they liked my makeup and I give all credit to Mally Roncal for her inspiration to help women feel "girly".  Try the product you will like it

I have been using this product for over a year.  Only took a couple of weeks to improve the very thin skin under my eyes. A little goes a long, long way.  One jar lasted me about 4 months using every day.  This product blends into the skin quickly and I use it under make-up.  It calms my skin.  I am happy about this product

What a brilliant package!  It's a squeezebottle with a brush at the end, and has a twist on lid.  No spills, no mess, no disaster.  Love it!

It is easy to apply with the brush.  I have Lava Flow, which is a shimmery pink.  The shimmer is a more obvious than I would like, as it's big flecks of sparkle, but it isn't so bad that it looks like glitter glue.  There is a strong smell and taste, sorta tropical; although it isn't unpleasant, it is powerful.  Kinda reminds me of red Koolaid.  The color is a bright pink when first applied, but simmers down to a medium pink and is rather sheer.  In the container the color looks unwearable, but in reality it isn't dramatic.  

The only drawback is how sticky it feels.  It is less sticky than Mac's Lipglass, but more so than Urban Decay XXX, if that makes sense.  

I got this as a freebie and I'm glad I got to try it.  I would buy it but in a different color

I'm not a makeup or product junkie by any means, but simply can't miss even one day of using my All About Lips. It is a cream (much like a moisturizer) that exfoliates and smoothes your lips and makes them fuller/plumper. It also fills in any lines you may have around the mouth so I recommend using it not only on your lips but also outside the lipline. Although I have been using it twice daily for many years, I believe someone using it for the first time should see results fairly quickly. 

Friends of mine who wear lipstick (I don't) also claim if they use it right before they put on lipstick it makes it go on better and last longer. 

(Apparently you can also use this product as an eye cream to smooth crowsfeet around the eyes, but I havent tried this- I prefer Caudelie eye serum and cream.) 

Simply put, I HIGHLY recommend this product and know you'll see results as I have!

I have used hundreds of kinds of smoothers and conditioners on my thick color-treated hair (it is poofy and rough without any help!)
And this stuff did the trick to make is smooth, lay down and be soft in ONE treatment!!!!!!!!!!!!
Buy this stuff if your hair is coarse and poofy and spilt/damaged! You need this stuff. It smells good, is easy to use (and just use a tiny bit!) and works

First of all, it seems a bit silly to defend the smell of any product, as everyone has different oppinions on this. I happen to love the smell, but I am writing this review to talk about what this product actually does; which is transforms hair. I have naturally curly hair, and awhile back I chopped it all off on a hairdresser's suggestion. When my hair was an inch long, it wasn't hard to fight my hair type. Now that I'm in the process of growing it out, my hair has been pretty annoyed at the contant blow drying, dying, and straightening I have subjected it to. Regardless of the cut, my hair has been limp and fried. After using this product along with Big shampoo, my hair has been absolutely transformed. People have commented on my hair ever since I have started using these wonderful products. Now to the issue of price: before using Lush, I was using bumble and bumble wich goes for 20 bucks a pop, as well as various styling products that ran in the similar price range... since using Lush, I have no need for styling products, therefore making these purchases very economical. I can't say enough great things about this brand

Now let's get its effectiveness out of the way so we can talk about that love it or hate it scent! It is a really thick conditioner and works great every other day or every few days. I have really long hair and this tames it and smoothes my split ends, and it leaves my hair shiny. It isn't greasy at all. 

If you are used to drugstore or salon conditioners, don't judge the effectiveness of any natural conditioner for a month. That is how long it can take for the silicones in mainstream conditioners to leave your hair (silicones are all those things in conditioner that end in "cone", like dimethicone, etc). Detoxing your hair off silicones is well worth it though, my hair is much healthier and shinier without that buildup.

So the scent: It is green, kind of melon and fresh, with a hint of violet (like Bathos, Gratuitous Violets, and Daddyo) to it. It took some getting used to, and when I first got it I thought it smelled of green beans or some vegetable-like smell. But when you use it and rinse it out, you are left with a rich green scent, with the tiniest hint of gently floral violet. 

It isn't for everybody, but if you buy it, give it a chance to work its magic in your hair before you make your judgement, because that lovely violetty smell combined with how well it works makes it kind of addictive. I use it with Daddyo shampoo to enhance that hint of violet and the fresh green scent I get from it. I use it in rotation with American Cream which is a bit lighter

Earlier on I had read all the reviews for Retread. Paying 20 bucks for a conditioner did not quite suit me. However, I have been using it for a month now and I have to say that the reviews were an inadequate discription of the product. Personally, I believe this to be an amazing product. I used it in combination with Big and I believe my hair has never looked better. Retread is a superb conditioner and really does wonders. I have virgin hair, but I do blow dry it ever day so I felt a heavier conditioner was necessary. Since this is a deeper conditioner I would leave it in for 5-10 min or while you do all your other stuff in the shower/bath. My hair was softer than ever afterwards (that could be from Big though) and shined like the sun. This is not an everyday conditioner but works well for once or twice a week (I mainly use it for special occasions, or when I just want to feel pretty!) I highly recommend it and I feel that it works much better than Lush's conditioning treatments. The only issue was the smell. I am not much into the smell of cucumbers and to me that is what it smelled like. However, this could just be a personal attribute as no one else has mentioned this. The product was still amazing though, and I am willing to endure the smell(It fades as the day goes on). My decision about this product is Miracle! Hope this helps!

HI
</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
I just bought Retread Hair Conditioner today from my local LUSH store and tried it tonight.  My hair was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G after I used it.  After I've read all the reviews about the product, I was still a little skepticle, as I've tried many things that had awesome reviews, but just didn't work with my thick coarse hair.  

I shampooed my hair, put in Retread Hair Conditioner, covered my hair with a plastic cap and set a hot towel over it for an hour (dunking the towel in hot water every 15 minutes to 'reheat' it).  Rinsed out the conditioner and didn't use anything else on my hair (I usually have to put in anti-frizz serum).  

The first thing I noticed was the shine... what a HUGE difference.  Even my boyfriend said there was something different, but he couldn't quite figure it out.  Retread Hair Conditioner left my hair super soft too.  And you don't even need to use that much.

Now for the bad....

the smell (that's why it's not 5 stars)!  I know some people say they love it and some people say they hate it, and I really think that's the way it is... you either hate it or love it.  I actully hated it.  My boyfriend took one whiff (and thought it smelled like old soggy towels) and offered to drive me back to LUSH to return it because he thought it was 'old'.  Another reviewer said it smelled like 'barnyard' and I think that's the best way to describe it.  You do get used to it (and luckly the smell fades as your hair dries), but for me, the smell was too much.  

I will buy again because I absolutely love the results, but I will only use Retread Hair Conditioner when I know I will be home the next day to spare others from the smell

It is a very good conditioner. It is light and yet conditioning. but to me it smells like hay or cud or something cowish.  It smells distinctively barnyard.  but I see that many like the smell so maybe it is just me.

Is there anyone who doesn't know the name Sarah Jessica Parker? Okay. Think "Carrie" on TV's enormously successful "Sex and the City." She was the gal who dressed to the nines - always with style and glamour. She brings both of those qualities to her first fragrance, "Lovely Sarah Jessica Parker." 

It's a unique, almost indescribable blend of classicism, chic, and innocence. There's not a scent like it with top notes of fresh Mandarin, Bergamot, Lavender, and Apple Martini. Vibrant and warm it's a fragrance that caresses the senses. 

Middles notes are Patchouli, tender Paper Whites, and luxe Orchid. These are enhanced by bottom notes of irresistible white amber, sensuous cedar, and the very sultry musk. This is a scent I revel in, and enjoy wearing. 

The bottle is, of course, simple and exquisite, curved with polished glass, ultra feminine. 

Lovely Sarah Jessica Parker is a beautiful, dreamy yet quite alive fragrance appropriate for every occasion.

I have sensitive, acne prone, combination skin (oily in the t-zone). I've used various toners for months at a time and this is the first toner that doesn't burn when I use it. It reminds me of a better smelling witchhazel astringent -I used witchhazel as a kid to help prevent my skin from breaking out. It has a nice fruity scent which is great since most toners (especially Clinique) smell like alcohol. I just wish it was a little cheaper! The bottle is pretty big so it will last me for 3 months which makes the price not quite so painful. I use it with the Clarifiance Oil Free Gel Cleanser morning and night

I normally do not like anything with a "sandalwood" scent..but this stuff is absolutely wonderfull!  They are not lying when they refer to it as an "addictive" scent in the description..I got a small sample bottle and fell in love...it is perfect for the winter/fall seasons, not so much for the summer.  It's fun when people ask what I'm wearing and I get to casually say "Prada."  Considering I live in Tennessee most people have no idea what that means..but I still feel special

Rice Bran is the secret to these products and the results are immediately apparent in the texture of your skin. After just one to two uses, you start to notice a sense of calm and order descending upon your formerly sensitive skin. This is especially apparent if you layer the products, first using the cleanser, toner and then the essence and skin creams. If you have oily or combination skin, you may be amazed at how balanced your skin becomes. 

The Skin Essence contains Mulberry that naturally lightens discoloration from sun damage and aging. The antioxidants help to revitalize the skin. This is applied before the cream. Who knew when we were climbing around in mulberry trees staining our fingers and faces as children that one day we would use an extract in a lotion that would heal the skin and lighten our skin. 

Age spots and freckles literally start to disappear or may even slightly whiten more than the surrounding skin so they literally seem to fade away. I noticed this after just a few uses so it is super effective. 

Another reason to use this product is the "super" and I mean super fast healing properties. I was amazed. Put this on any skin irritation and watch it disappear in days. 

These products are so fun to use, I've incorporated them into a little night routine for my husband where I give him an antiaging facial before bed. I saw the results of the products on my skin and wanted to share this secret with him. His skin looked instantly more hydrated and he has dry skin. With my combination skin I've seen great results in balancing and clarity. 

The cleansers are like the champagne of skincare and the rest of the line is equally impressive. These are sort of out of my price range if I they didn't last so long and were not so effective. You only need such a small amount so in the end, it will be very economical and the results are superior to other products I've tried. The products also seem to encourage a natural exfoliation and deep cleansing, so you save money on all those other products you used to have to buy all the time. Plus, your skin will clear up and you can say goodbye to all those annoying costly solutions to a problem these products actually prevent. 

The entire line deserves 100 Stars! If you struggle to 
keep your skin clear, these products also provide
a new sense of confidence and are emotionally healing. 

Another surprising use for this product is on scars. Old
scars and new scars. They seem to just fade away. 

As Liv Tyler once said: "I Swear Buy." Well, she was talking about the shampoo. 

I say: "Collect Them." These products are essential and the best I've ever tried.

I have coarse afrcian-american hair that is relaxed straight. This conditioner is the best I have ever used. I wish I could buy it in a larger bottle.  The only thing however, I think it is expensive.  Because of the price I use it only when wanting to deeply condition my hair. Otherwise, I would use it after every shampoo. Wonderful stuff

About two weeks ago I got a very small metal splinter embedded in one of my fingers when I picked up an old office magnifying glass that had a corroded metal trim piece.

I used my conventional tweezers and managed to break off a piece, leaving an even smaller piece that I could hardly see still in my finger.  My conventional tweezers could only push it further into my flesh, so I quit trying to get it out.  

It wasn't doing any harm, surrounded by upper skin layers, so I looked for the best tweezers I could find and ordered these.

I got them a few days ago at work and within a few minutes I had that teeny tiny splinter out of my finger.  These are great

I am obviously addicted to Philosophy, but it's a good addiction.  My skin looks great, better than it ever has in my life!  Whenever I feel like doing something for myself, I try a new Philosophy product, because it's sure to give me a lift.  This product is called a "microdelivery peel", but I view (and use) it more as a toner.  Philosophy's two-part microdelivery peel is awesome, and I would not attempt to replace it with these pads.  With the two part peel, you clean your face with Purity Made Simple cleanser, then massage in the abrasive crystals.  After a few minutes, you squeeze out a little of the liquid, which mixes with the crystals on your face and heats up, infusing your skin with vitamin C and other healthy goodies.  That is a real peel!  These little pads, on the other hand, are cool, refreshing, and subtle.  You can use them every day, and they won't make your skin red.  They freshen your skin, and you know they contain great things that will help your skin, because they are made by Philosophy

After years of searching I've finally found the perfect perfume. Pink Sugar makes me feel fabulous when I wear it; it's so light and `warm' with a base of sensual vanilla. I have the large bottle, body mousse & deodorent at home, and the smaller bottle in my handbag. I don't get bored with this fragrence, like I do with everything else I've tried over the years.

The first time I wore Pink Sugar to work one colleague commented on the aroma of drinking chocolate as I was in the lift with her. The next time I was in the lift, everyone commented on my lovely vanilla perfume. After I applied a freshen up spray, another colleague said she could smell cakes! Yet another colleague demanded to know what I was wearing, and where she could get some. Strangers come up to me in the street to ask what scent I'm wearing...

No this isn't a cheesy ad, it really happened!! 


What do I sense first? Liquorice, a rich aniseed scent that gradually settles into a middle note of caramel. Marshmallow is the first word that springs to mind to me. 

If you like Angel, Fantasy or Princess you need to give this a try!



 *Aquolina needs to make Pink Sugar available to the U.K. - Postage and packing costs a fortune!!!

Go read the review I wrote on the shampoo the same goes for this product. Cheaper at QVC then Amazon like all the other 30 or so products I have shopped around for in the last 6 months. Go back into the stores people you will find prices cheaper than at Amazon!!!

I purchased this after reading the reviews. I had never heard of it, let alone tested it. I had some gift certificates & thought I'll be impulsive. ~ When I first opened it I thought "oh no, this is going to be heady (or strong)".. but it seemed to 'change within seconds upon application, and got even better as it settled. My daughter wears vera wang princess, and she, too, loves Lolita. It's my newest fav & a possible signature scent for me. Will def. buy again

I have been looking for this eyeliner for years!  Ever since they stopped carrying it at Rite-Aid I have been on a quest to find the perfect waterproof eyeliner to replace the 2.99 lord and berry one.  I even tried expensive brands like mac and clinique with no such luck.  This eyeliner is great for women who like to line their inner eye, it goes on smooth and dark and stays put until you wash it off

The resort we stayed at in Fiji (Maravu, on the island of Taveuni - also highly recommended) used Pure Fiji products in their bures, and I fell in love with this pineapple soap.  We showered outdoors and the smell and feel will always remind me of our honeymoon.  I brought some of this soap back in my luggage but it was lost somehow, so I just had to buy some!  We did get some of the shampoo and conditioner samples which also smell wonderful!  Mmmm..

This is a great cleaner, but I'd suggest getting the Anthony Algae cleanser first.  This glycolic facial cleaner does prep your face for a good shave, but overdries.  It is not suggested for those who have dry skin or acne problems

This stuff smells just like philosophy's handmade hand cream but not as strong, that's why I took one point off. It has a light, sweet lemon scent with a vanilla background. Of course it's is wonderful as a shampoo and body gell just like all the other philosophy 3-1's. If it where stronger scented it would be my favorite

I use this purely as shower gel/cleanser and absolutely love it.  The smell is great - not too overpowering and really perks me up in the morning.  It reminds me of the lemonade stands I used to have as a kid.  Easily one of my favorite Philosophy fragrances.  I also recommend "Falling in Love," and "Strawberry Daquiri."  In fact, I don't think you could go wrong with any Philosophy products!

I received a free sample during "Clinique days" at my local department store.  I wore it the next day to work and received several compliments on how "clean" and "light" it smelled.  Two coworkers even went out within the next week and purchased some for themselves.  It is perfect for a light, clean scent during the day... to wear to work, or a day out with friends or that special someone.  It smells wonderful, but not as though you are trying too hard.  Perfect

The citrus touch in this perfume keeps it from being flowery, and potentially old ladyish.  It is not too strong even at first application, but wears quite well.  You will not feel as though you are wearing perfume; it seems far too light for that.  I would certainly recommend it for its versatility, as well

I love this perfume because it really lifts my mood.  I always thought of it as a little more citrus-y, but it's just a very fun perfume.  It's also nice because it's fun and flirty but still mature in a young professional type of way--if that makes any sense.  Ultimately, it's a great perfume, and I wear it almost daily

     This product is wonderful for individuals with very dry skin. I usually apply this cream right before I put my foundation on and it works very well together.  It leaves my skin feeling very moist without it being sticky.  In addition to that, it's got a luscious cucumber smell to it.  I would highly reccomend this product to those who are seeking to get rid their "Moisture Thirsting" skin.  *Although it may be alittle costly, it will last you about 4 months~

I have Amazing Grace, Pure Grace, Baby Grace and Falling in Love.  These are the only scents I use now.  But Falling in Love was a bigger bottle than the other three and I'm almost out of it.  This is the best I've ever smelled.

I really love this gift set..you will smell sooo yummy!!  At first when I put it on it smelled so familiar, then my husband and I decided it reminds us of sweet cotton candy..we love it!  Although now I am getting hooked on Amazing Grace...also a familiar, clean, fresh, scent. Philosophy is great

I have used these for years, and when I run out, my skin knows and shows the difference.  I have super sensitive skin that tends to become red and itchy when exposed to any kind of change in weather....cold or hot.  I carry these in my purse, and have them stashed all over the house....misting my face many times a day....voila....clear and moisterized skin!  They really do work wonders on sensitive facial skin, and they keep mine from being red and itchy, which makes me very happy

I don't have excessively oily skin, but I've never been able to wear mascara without smudging.  Waterproof, smudgeproof, expensive, drugstore, you name it I've tried it.  Every single one left dark shadows under my eyes within 2 or 3 hours.  I'd given up on mascara completely, but thought I'd try one more time with this (with the money back guarantee from spalook, what's the risk?)

This mascara lives up to it's name as smudge-proof.  Even wearing sunscreen on my under-eye area, it doesn't transfer.  Even in 100+ deg Phoenix heat, it stays.  I *love* it for this reason.  It also comes off easily at night; no problems there.

However, I'm giving it only 4 stars because it does flake a little throughout the day.  Not a lot, and not enough to make me stop using it (the first truly smudge-proof mascara I've found), but it is there.  Since it's advertised as smudge and flake-proof, I can't give it the full 5 stars

Ever wished you could rub your eyes while you're wearing your make up?  Now you can.  You can't be rubbing at your eyes too much or it will start to flake off, but this mascara takes quite a beating before it will budge and will never, ever smudge.  One might be led to believe this means it is difficult to remove at night, but all you need to remove it is water.  This stuff is practically worth getting just to ponder the chemistry involved

This mascara is great, it's easy to remove with a little warm water, but the best thing about it is that it won't give you 'racoon eyes'. There's no dis-coloration of the skin around the eyes. It also keeps looking great all through the day, no need to re-apply it.
The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is, that even though they come in different colors, they all look more black than colored when dry. So the color doesn't stand out enough.
Still, I can highly recommend it

Philosophy products are very eye catching.  Their smart, clean looking bottles and the cool names given to each.  I work with skin care products and don't always believe what they claim.  There are usually far too many claims to be made that simply can't be done to someones skin.  
This product however, is pretty good.  It's a fairly good moisturiser that could honestly sell for less considering the cost of the product, but it does do the job it promises.  The only problem I have with it, is that for someone with sensitive skin, there is far too much frangrant extracts in here.  It cannot be good for sensitive skin.  I'd recommend this to Dry skin people only

I have suffered from rosacia for the past nine years. As I was fairly young to be starting through a change of life, I had no idea what was causing my complexion problems. Not understanding (or expecting)what was happening to my skin, I made many many mistakes during the first year or so, trying to remedy the symptoms with countless products formulated more for adult acne or aging tired skin, bad idea. If you have rosacea or very sensitive skin, you know that sometimes it seems that all you need do is touch your skin the wrong way and you break out, let alone slathering some chemically based, perfumed, or exfoliating (ground pits and the like) product on your face. This becomes especially discouraging when you are also beginning to see the normal signs of aging but sensitivities won't allow you to take advantage of some of the great treatments out there to nourish your skin and stay a step ahead of the wrinkles, not to mention feeling starved for the moisture which is the real key to younger, healthy looking skin. After awhile I was afraid to try anything else, so I just stopped. I washed my face gently and left it at that. Well it only got worse and I felt like a dried up prune. Enter Philosophy hope in a jar for dry sensitive skin. It's as if this product was made just for me. Now instead of people asking me "what's wrong with your face?" they ask, "what type of skincare do you use?" Since I've been using The Philosophy skin care line, I find I guite often feel comfortable going out without makeup, something I had rarely done since my twenties. Since sun protection is so important, Philosophy offers a product called, When hope is not enough with spf 20 for daytime which comes in a bottle, but I have found that my skin responds much better to the Hope in a jar-dry sensitive formula, then followed by Philosophy's seperate sunsreen called Shelter-spf 15. This is because "Shelter" does not contain vitamin C or peptides and has a slightly lower concentration of sunscreens, contrary to the spf-20 moisurizer combo. You may be able to get by with the combination product and save a few bucks, but the aforementioned ingredients in it do not agree with my sensitivities, especially the vitamin C. As for the much needed exfoliation dilemma, try philosophy's, Micro-delivery peel pads or their "Peel kit" both are soothing and non-abrasive. Hope this helps and enjoy your new skin!

I LOVE everything about these sops!!!  They are luxurious and delicious at the same time......one thing I need to indulge in.
The scents last for days after you've used them.....my bathroom still smells like a mix of verbena and honey-almond!!!! Just scrumptious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Not to mention how your skin smells and feels afterwards!
These are amazing soaps that EVERYONE should use.  I feel exquisite using them and the gift sets are a fabulous thing to give to friends or even aquaintences.  They are sure to think of how thoughtful you were to give it to them everytime they use this wonderful soap!!!!!!

With just a hint of sheer red color, this lip balm in a tube is one of the best I've tried. The smell is intoxicating, the feel divine. What's best to me: 1) the subtle shade of red color, sheer but sexy, moisturizing but not greasy or gloppy and 2) it lasts FOREVER. I have never before paid $10 for a tube of lip balm, but I will gladly do it again. For those that wonder who it looks good on: my opinion is everybody! I am a dark-brown haired, light skinned, brown-eyed girl, with no pink or rosy color to my natural dead-white skin color/coloring. I burn easily and freckle, too. My sister has brownish-auburn-hair, medium-toned beige skin color with hazel-brown eyes and it looks great on her, too. She tans easily. My niece is blondish-brown haired, has light brown eyes and fair skin with a bit of pink in it and tans easily. It looked great on her, too. 

Buy it and enjoy it

This has been my everyday scent for the last six years. The predominent note is a sparkling anise, an anise that affects a cold, even metallic, chemic artifice. Swirling about this shivery base note are hints of moss, violet, and vanilla-like tonka, lending an aura of both forest and fantasy. 

Though this is a relatively popular scent, Lolita eschews convention. There are no white flowers, no rose, no peach, none of the banal and cloying sweetness that plagues so many scents. This perfume is instead sensual yet apart, not at all come-hither but insinuating and dark as a Grimm's tale. The tonka is sweet and powdery, gently seductive, while the more prominent anise intoxicates.

The bottle is stunning; I never throw out a spent one.

Orris Root powder has a scent similar to violets although in this Tisty Tosty bath bomb, even with the addition of rose oil, it is not an overpowering fragrance. I think they could add double the rose oil, but you can add in rose and ylang ylang if you are in the mood. The Tisty Tosty heart-shaped bath bomb is perfect if you enjoy blending your own essential oils or prefer a mild/calming bathing experience. 

I'd suggest using this one for skin calming and also adding in a "Romance In a Stone," "Sex Bomb" or "Chelsea Garden" bath bomb to add a little more romance to the bath. 

I did feel emotionally calm (rose balances the emotions) and my skin loved this bath bomb, but it was not as sensory as I'd hoped. Following this bath with the "It's A Pleasure Treasure Massage Bar" is fun, also heart-shaped. 

You may want to try the "Violet" soap with this bathing experience. The next time I try this, I might mix it with an "Elixir" bath melt and a bit of the "Bathos" bubble bar, also scented with violet. 

As far as this being a magic spell, you just never know who might call you when you use this bath. Probably right when you are in the bath. So, if you think this will work instantly, you might want to keep the phone by the tub. It was funny, but when I was in the bath, my husband was trying to call me and said he let the phone ring and ring. Did he really think I would leave the pleasure of a Lush bath to answer the phone? 

Personally, I think they should scent this bath bomb like the It's a Pleasure Treasure Massage Bar. It is blissfully delicious and almost seems edible - looks like white chocolate (it is mostly cocoa butter) and has a heady scent of orange blossom honey and neroli.

This smells good and the heart shape is cute. But, it lost it's scent when it dissolved which was dissipointing and the flowers turned the water darkish. I liked it but it's not one of my favorites.

If you love roses, this is a romantic bath luxury, with seven rose buds for your bathing delight. For a candlelit bath with romance, let it dissolve unencumbered. For scent but no mess, put it in a mesh bag first, because little flower bits will be all over the tub. At least it has no glitter. The scent is not particularly strong, but it is full of a natural rose scent that smells wonderful

I have been using Lush products for a few years now. First introduced to them when I was in Australia.
I always keep some in my linen closet as it gives a faint wonderful scent to all the sheets and pillowcases.

Try all of the bath bombs. I use the Tisty Tosty whenever I need an evening of self indulgence. Put the water on and watch the heart-shaped bomb fizzle and send hundreds of rose petals floating to the top of the tub.
Put some fluffy bath towels to warm on a rail.
Place some Dr Haushka's oil to heat by a radiator.
Pour a glass of champagne.
Surround the tub with lots of  tea lights.
Put on some Rahman music.
Get in and imagine a private Ganges.
When you get out its very eassy to scoop up the petals- take the pre-warmed towels and wrap yourself in one.

 By then the oils will be warm and pour in palm of hand and rub on body. 
I also like to put some  bath bombs in guest bedrooms with the towels- 
If you haven't tried the Karma soap do try it ......alone or with someone special..

This is the one you give to someone you love. The wonderful rose scent is very light, not overpowering at all. And the pretty little dried rosebuds are so charming. I love lying in the tub with those rosebuds floating around me. It makes me feel like I'm lying in a beautiful garden

I had read about these new creme eyeshadows in one of the magazines within the last few months. I decided to go to the counter at the Bloomingdale's near my house. The SA at the counter said she thought based on my coloring and eyes that the rose gold would be a good choice for me. I was looking for a shadow that could be good for daytime and also nighttime. I took home the rose gold and it was really really beautiful on. Not only that, but it is long-lasting and doesn't crease. I may have to invest in one or more of the other colors available. Definitely a worthwhile purchase and the tube will last you a long time.

I am 5'11" tall, and have stretchmarks everywhere from growing 8 inches in one year as an adolescent.  So I thought I'd get even more of them during my pregnancy and 40 lb. weight gain.  I bought the Mustela lotion as a "might as well" gift to myself, not really expecting anything.  I am thrilled to say that after using this cream every day on my breasts and belly during the last 6 weeks of my pregnancy, I didn't get ANY new stretchmarks anywhere.  I still can't believe it -- and I was looking closely for them just to be sure.  The lotion is quite rich, so a little goes a long way -- the tube lasted 8 weeks.  I'm completely sold on Mustela products, and use the super soft and fragrant baby wipes on my new little girl.  No diaper rash at all so far

I started using this cream during my 2nd month of pregnancy.  I think it's important to start building the elasticity of your skin early on, which could be the reason I had success with it.  While the cream is kindof expensive-- when you think about avoiding stretchmarks, no price is too high. I used about 4 tubes for the duration.  I expected to get stretchmarks because my mom had them with me, so I was happy to get anything less than hers.  Anyway, I didn't get any at all on my stomach until the last two weeks (my baby was 8lbs. 8oz.) and they are really small.  I put the cream on my breasts and abdomen every day after a shower, but because it was expensive I skipped my sides (love handle area) and did get stretchmarks there which were darker than the ones on my stomach. Since my stomach has gone down, the ones on my stomach are very light and will probably go away enough to satisfy my ego.  I highly recommend giving the Mustela cream a chance

I first tried this when my Mum bought a bottle during her holiday in November. The weather was cold, wet & dark at home. When I sprayed some on my wrists I wasn't impressed.

Come June & sunny, hot & bright days, I found myself trying `Just Me' in the shops & buying a bottle (which I'm quickly making my way through).

Lighter & easier to wear then `Paris Hilton', I'm using it all the time. Scent wise; the strongest note for me is the pink peppercorn - sharp & tangy. It contrasts nicely with the floral notes, so neither individual note overpowers me.

Overall `Just Me' can be worn anywhere during the day; work, shopping or lunch.
For evening and autumn/winter look elsewhere.

I'm 18! Well you will think what does 18 have to do with this cream.

I don't have any wrinkle. My skin has been really good until I get into college. My eyes become really tired and I start to have a lot of dark circle plus puffiness.

After reading a recommendation from a fashion magazine, which says everybody at every age need an eye cream. Ok, fine, I will get one. I chose the one got the highest rate!

Overall quality, it is very good to moisturize my eye area. This means it is easier to apply foundation/concealer/eye makeup. But my puff is still here. I still have dark circle! No reducing! I know that I need to have a better schedule to have enough sleep but still, I expected higher on this product.

About the size, the small little teeny tiny one is good enough for you to use for months. Usually I will use it at night. When I have to apply concealer, I will apply another time.

I received a tube of philosophy's cinnamon buns flavored lip gloss for Christmas (along with other philosophy products). I was super excited to try this because I've been told by numerous people that philosophy's products are spectacular. First, I must point out that there are sparkles in this lip gloss. Although they're very subtle on your lips, if you're the type of gal who hates sparkles and shimmer in your makeup, I'd stay away from this product. As for smell, it DOES smell like cinnamon buns. It certainly does not TASTE like it however (which is a good thing... I tend to lick off my lip gloss if it tastes good... this lip gloss does not taste good). It's very sticky and thick so you don't have to use too much. It also stays on your lips for a good amount of time. Would I suggest this product? If you're looking for a good-smelling, long lasting lip gloss, I'd definitely recommend this. However, if these two things don't matter to you I'd suggest you skip this ($10 for a tube of lip gloss isn't cheap after all) and go for a drugstore brand lip gloss

I was pretty wary of buying this because of the price, but it really is worth it. The can has lasted me almost a year, and it's not even empty! It's wonderful! I have very oily, acne prone skin with rosacea, and this stuff makes me look like I have a flawless, beautiful complexion. And I'm not exaggerating. It feels like I'm not wearing makeup. I just can't say enough about it. This is the one thing that I couldn't live without. You need to try it!!!

I have been looking high and low for a fragrance that wasn't strong.  I have tried so many perfumes and body sprays it is ridiculous.  I have finally found the one I will use for more than a week.  I love it!  

The smell is so clean and simple.  The first day I wore it I had 3 seperate people tell me I smelled good.  I have NEVER had even one person tell me that, let alone 3.  I was amazed.  Also, I noticed that they told me I smelled good.  They didn't say your perfume smells good.  

I am not sure how to describe the smell.  It reminds me of that out-of-the-shower fresh smell that we wish we could have all day.  I will never use any other fragrances but Philosophy fragrances.  I plan on trying all their other wonderful scents as well

I have very sensitive skin and this product does not irritate by the end of the as other products have.  Also my coloring is very fair, red hair and blue eyes, even with brown/black mascara I always looked a little off-matched.  The brown in this line is a beautiful color and looks more natural than any I have ever used.  The ease of removal is the icing on the cake

Most waterproof mascaras are designed to come off with an oil-based remover.  Stupid idea;   our skin has oil in it.  After a couple hours we end up with "racoon" eyes."  DOH, who needs that?  Mirenesse mascara only comes off with soap AND water, in combination.  Better living through chemistry!  Since I happen to be one of those people with a little extra oil in their skin in adulthood, I especially appreciate this fact, plus they make it in Brown/black  I'm a redhead, and am so sick of   searching for something other than black-black mascara!  It is simply too dark if you are not a brunette or blonde.  I need something with some brown in it, and this mascara fits the bill, perfectly.  For those who find it too clumpy, well, learn how to apply mascara--tweens!  This mascara goes on best with one coat, so make your first application count.  You don't need a second coat.  It won't look good, so do one coat, period.  If you can't get it right the first time, you need some practice and a mirror with a higher magnification.  If you think you need more mascara than that, think again.  Unless you are walking Sunset

I really loved the clean, citrus scent of Tommy Girl. It has a grapefruit-like scent--very clean and pungent.

Unfortunately, after I became pregnant and had my son, my body chemistry changed. Now, it stinks on me. :o(

Still, it smells great as a scent, but you may want to try a tester before buying it. This is one of those fragrances that I think are a bit risky to buy "sight unseen"...unless you're sure your gal absolutely loves clean, citrusy, pungent scents. (But remember, that doesn't mean it will smell good on her...

The first thing you notice is the clean burst of citrus. It's yummy and fresh and sexy. Then the fragrance reveals its deeper layers and you are drawn in. This is a wonderful fragrance for men. Both of Vera Wang's fragrances (for men and women) are top quality, multi layered, emminently pleasing, and would make fabulous gifts. Buy this for your man and enjoy

This is truly the best in highlighting products and I have tried many high end and cheaper products out there.  This is so light and just doesn't get all cakey and greasy.  I have tried so many brands that claim to look natural, but they just don't.  This really does and don't let the price fool you either.  It only takes alittle and lasts a long time, so well worth the price for the look it gives.  I love this!

I'm giving this product 4 stars for how well this pencil blends with any brow color....I would think for people who use and like to define brows with pencil, this is a perfect neutral color.I subtracted one star because i
prefer to apply brow definers with brow powder and a brush. I think it looks more natural..  Brenda Christian makes a brow powder which I prefer over pencils but the color of this pencil is far superior to any powder
I can find.  Sometimes I mix the two. I start with the pencil and add a bit of powder.  All all, it's the color of this pencil that is superior to all other eyebrow pencils

I like that the gloss isn't goopy or sticky, and that it provides a sheer wash of color that seems to stay put for a while, but you don't get much product. I bought Flare and love the color and the way it somewhat stains your lips with a light wash of color, so even when the gloss wears off you still have some color on your lips. I wasn't really thrilled with the small amount of gloss you actually get in the pen. But overall, I do like it, but don't know if I'd buy it again

Bought this for my boyfriend, and I can't stop smelling him because it's unlike any other cologne I've ever come upon.  It's so intriguing that I find myself sniffing him just to get another whiff of it.  I can best describe it as a soft-suede with hints of amber, vanilla, and wood. It smells better after it's been on the skin for a while.  It does  have a slight feminine scent, however, this makes me like it more, and makes me want HIM to wear it more.  It's definetely for a confident man

Eternity was signature scent of the late 80's early 90's and has been around long enough to gain a rightful, classic status now.
It is one of the best on the market, it smells classy, clean, zingy and has more than a touch of the erotic about it.
Always worth having a bottle handy even if you don't wear it everyday, it is a yummy, scrummy scent

I absolutely love this eyeshadow. I have it in three different colors, as after my first one (the Illuminateur), I got addicted. I've since bought the Ambre and the Bleu Swimming Pool. It can be hard to tell from pictures on this site, or any other, what the color of this item is really like. That is it say, it changes depending on the light. My white Illuminateur looks purple in some lights, shiny white in others, and a light blue in others. It's really amazing on its own, or layered. All of the colors have a lot of "oomph" to them. Make sure you shake the bottle before using for best color results (as mentioned on the packaging).

As someone who doesn't own a lot of makeup brushes, I love that it includes one. However, I have noticed with these, and with other brands of eyeshadow that have similar packaging, if you're not careful, you can bend some of the bristles backwards (and they may stay that way) when reinserting the brush. Simply solved by not rushing. :

	Glamorous, mysterious, seductive all describe Armani Code, a captivating orange blossom based scent from Giorgio Armani Fragrance.

	As one would expect from this master couturier the bottle itself is a gem.  Tapering from a weighted base the slim flacon seems to glow as lacquered shades of blue sweep from an early dawn at the bottom of the sleek holder to midnight nearing the top.  Adding to the fragrance's intrigue is an oriental effect achieved by  lace embroidery on the glass.

	The scent  is sweet yet sensuous with a sparkle provided by orange zest.  With orange blossom at its heart Armani Code is enhanced by Sambac jasmine, Madagascan vanilla and honey.  The man in my life called it "delicious," and I do, too.  It's now high on my list of favorite fragrances.

I don't know how many mascaras I own but there's always about two or three that I hold as my favorite or just for different occasions. One of those is Hypnose and I really like it for when I go out or just looking for that dramatic look.

Postive:
1.) The look: I've never neccessarily wanted to wear fake eyelashes but they do look almost perfect. Unbelievably, Hypnose gives you that look. It's amazing just how feathery your eyelashes look.
2.) Flaking: This mascara never really flaked on the bottom of my eyes. That's really important to me.

Negative:
1.) This mascara starts out great but after about two and a half weeks it starts emptying out on you. This might just be because there were days when I reapplyed it or simply because I just used it pretty well (1 coat just about everyday because of how much I liked it).

Summary: If you want that natural yet "are those real lashes?!" look, then you'll like this mascara. I'm giving it four stars instead of five simply because of how long it lasts but if you use it once it a while, then it will last you a while

I was very impressed with the texture of these shadows. They slip on softly with a great feel and last all day or night with no creasing. I also like the way the colors will go on subtley with a light touch or with a heavier hand build up for more intensity. The color selection is gorgeous. Just one word of warning -- you can't really go by the color samples. It's better to see them in person. I bought Lilac Mist which is beautiful on the brow bone and was very close to what I was expecting. But Paris By Night looks like a gray but is actually a deep mauve. I was dissapointed until I tried it. It contoured my eyes beautifully and while intense is very natural looking. This is about the fourth time I've bought Laura Mercier products and I've been totally pleased with the quality.

Like the powder blush, this eye shadow is silky not chalky.  It goes on sheer and looks natural but beautiful.  All of the colors I've tried are very nice.  Toasted Almond is a wonderful ivory.  American Coffee is a rich brown (but doesn't go on too dark -- you can layer it for more drama), Caramel is a creamy beige.  
This is a great product for everyday.
NOTE:  You will need an eye shadow brush for this just as you need a blush brush -- it does not come with one

I have used this product for the past 16 years. It is wonderful!The Super Double Face Powder is actually a foundation and matte powder all rolled into one product. The product comes with an application sponge, goes on dry, gives superb coverage! I don't even use my Clinique concelar when I wear this product, it is that good! This product works best with those individuals who have normal or combination skin.

As someone who really dislikes making up, but needs a bit of cover in her face powder, I have found Clinique's Superpowder to be just the right product. I have been using it for nearly ten years. In between Superpowder purchases I have tried other lesser brands and have always returned to this product. It is truly no muss, no fuss. No foundation, or concealers, just a nice simple matte powder that sets in naturally. No powdery bits sitting on the skin surface, no flaking ... and stays on all day with nary a touch up ... just perfect

This is a fantastic product and lasts forever, so the relatively steep cost is not so bad.  This is a great product for using under eye makeup, because it makes the eye makeup slip on better and stay on longer, or alone, for a natural but still 'put-together' look.  I love this product more than mascara, and haven't found anything like it in other product lines.

I have never found a compact foundation, cream or powder, that looked and lasted even remotely as well as a liquid foundation with a dusting of powder over it. Until now. This is an amazing makeup, and the best part is that it doesn't take a whole lot of product to achieve perfect coverage. My skin tends to be red, but this doesn't even hint at it. Plus, it's a nice matte without being too dry. 
For everyday, this is my time saving, face perfecting miracle.

For a mirror shine and one that doesn't disappear on the rim of a glass with the first sip my choice is MAC. Lipglass feels good on your lips, as if it contained some emollients. And (this is a big AND) it's not tacky or sticky. 

The colors are a veritable palette of shades to suit every mood, occasion and skin tone. They range from a playfully innocent baby-doll nude to a dramatic dark diva red. 

Another plus (and this is a big PLUS following the big AND) MAC Lipglass is so price accessible that you can easily pick a bouquet of these delicious shades. Try adding a Lipglass over a country cousin lipstick for a wow impact. 

Enjoy!

MAC LipGlass is the absolute best. There are plenty of colors to choose from, SUPER-Shiny, and the gloss is thick, stays on and doesn't run. 
The best colors are....
NICO for a cute lavender pink color with a glittery shine. 
OYSTERGIRL is a shimmery baby pink.
OH BABY is the perfect gloss for any earth toned lipstick.
CHAI looks amazing with black smokey eyes. It's the perfect neutral earthy gloss and has no glitter or shimmer - just pure shine

I'm REALLY anal about scented/flavored lipglosses- especially ones scented or flavored with vanilla, but MAC LipGlass isn't that vanilla-ish at all!  It's got very pigmented color, it stays on a LONG time for a gloss, and each tube lasts a long time...  Don't let what the other reviewer said about the vanilla scent throw you off

I thought this stuff smelled fantastic, and very similar to a lavender poundcake. I guess smell is very subjective, though, so if you're not sure about this one, you might want to have a sniff at your local Sephora or department store before purchasing

I received this as a gift, and love it.  I don't normally use dusting powders, but this is light and silky.  The scent is very patchouli, which I happen to like.  Sort of reminds me of the head shops from the 60's-70's.  

I especially like the fact that all LUSH products are natural without a lot of chemicals

This tool is great for removing whiteheads and blackheads both.  As a RN with dermatology experience I have used many tools, I like this one as it saves you from bruising, or squishing your skin. So it solves the problem with a minimum of damage.  If you haven't used anything like this it may take some getting used to, but it's way better than using your fingers.  I gave it 4 of 5 stars as it can be a bit difficult to line up because the hole is so small

I love this scent - it's so fresh yet so distinctive.  Light enough to wear to a ballet or other event where you're in close qurters with others, but distinct enough that people notice it.  Every time I wear it I get compliments on how great I smell.

I really smell the peach in this, and thats why I love it. I love how its mixed in with the powdery florals. Its not heavy, its sexy without trying too hard and there is something old fashioned about it but it has a modern twist. I love this perfume

I am so sick of all the fragrances out there that smell like chocolate, pie or cake. Why people want to smell like food puzzles me. That's why I was so glad to find a feminine floral scent with a little tease to it. Maybe Baby is delightful, not too heavy but making its presence known. The complements will flow. It's sweet (not too sweet though) and innocent while at the same time being flirty. If I had to pick a season it reminds me of it would be Spring. I can't describe a frangrance anymore than I can describe a wine but with all the stinkers out there I just had to put in a good word for this very wearable scent.

If you love the scent of the Bathina line, Benefit has finally come out with an eau de toilette with the same scent. I wear this scent everyday and I always get compliments. I love to put the scent in my hair because it lingers in hair longer than skin. Many scents smell different on different skin types, but Maybe Baby is a pretty true scent. I guaruntee you will absolutely love this perfume and so will everyone around you. :

Ok I have really large lips and for years I have tried everything to protect them. Get this tin, for some reason the stick doesn't work as well, and your lips will be unchapped for the whole day. It's pricey but worth every penny if your like me and your lips chap easily. Trust me I have tried everything, even pricier chapsticks and this one does the trick

L'Occitane combined their famous lavender note with touches of peach, marigold and freesia to create a lovely, fresh and relaxing scent.  It's a nice one to wear before bed, too, not overpowering.  In the summer, I look for fragrances that contain natural notes mosquitoes do not care for and lavender is one of them.  The peach note in some fragrances also turns funky on my skin, but I have not had this problem with Eau de Recolte Bleue.  I prefer this over their Lavender Harvest fragrance, which I think would smell better on men (JMOP.)

Here is a description from their website:

"Eau de la Rcolte Bleue exudes all the pleasures of Provence. Both fresh and as light as air, it captures the celebratory feel of the Lavender Harvest.

Composed from a blend of the green scent of leaves and A.O.C. Lavender essential oil, Eau de la Rcolte Bleue is accompanied by the delicate notes of freesia, marigold and frosted peach. Woody and musky aromas then leave a lingering and sensual, fragrant trail."

All in all, I find this soft, gentle and thoroughly wearable.  Especially enjoy it on a summer evening.

Growing up worshiping the sun had finally taken its toll on my skin. As of late I have noticed sun spots on my face, chest and hands (yuck!). My Esthetician recommended I try Murad's Age Spot and Pigment Lightening Gel. In about a month I noticed the spots beginning to fade! It is super light weight and soaks in fast too!  Now all I have to do is remember the sunscreen..

Simplify, simplify, simplify! That's what I try to do with my beauty routine. Hence, I was first attracted to LAURA MERCIER'S facial cleanser by its name "ONE-STEP CLEANSER." 

I'm staying with it because it works. No more separate purchases for eyemake removers or "deep cleansers. 

"ONE-STEP CLEANSER" removes all traces of makeup even from the delicate eye area and leaves my skin feeling clean, supple and nourished. It's both easy and effective

I decided to try it out and have found the only soap I want to use.  The fragrance is great, it does not overpower.  I guess the milling process gives the soap it's texture which removes the need for all those bath/shower accessories.  And 1 bar lasted over 2 months.  I will definitely be ordering more and trying other products this vendor carries

The ground almond hulls are gentle enough for daily use of the soap directly on the skin without being scratchy. The scent is strong, but not overpowering and both the soap and scent are long lasting. This soap is also so moisturizing that my  skin doesn't require lotion as it does after most store brand soaps and shower gels. This particular soap is my main shower bar and my great experience with it convinced me to return to bar soap after years of being a Bath and Body Works shower gel and lotion fiend.

I got some of this body balm yesterday. The lady at the Benefit counter said that it would make my skin look luminescent like a Victoria's Secret model. She put a sample on one of my arms and I held it up to the other arm. The difference was amazing! The arm with the Bathina looked smoother, silker, and had a pearlized look. I can't stop raving about this stuff. It is slightly expensive, but the tin is really big (and adorable) and the supply of the balm is huge. It should last a really long time. This balm is one of the best products that Benefit has

Benefit claims that this is all you will want to wear, and I am starting to think this might be true...

First, I have to say that the texture is intriguing.  It's a balm, but it feels much more velvety, and the slight shimmer gives you a sheen.

Second, I am a sucker for the packaging and presentation.  It comes in a little tin box, with the signature Bathina (very retro chic) and a black powder puff that has a pink ribbon holder.  It makes you want to apply the product in public, just to have an excuse to show off the set.  Also, it ups the feminity factor of applying a product with the little puff (very "I adore being a girl...")

Then, there's the scent.  It's a floral, sexy fragrance that doesn't overpower.  It's clean and a big plus is that it doesn't make me sneeze, like some other scents.

I think that a little goes a long way, and thus, I can say that even though it's a "boutique-brand" product, it is very affordable.  I think that as warmer weather sets in, and you want to show off a little more skin, this is a product that would enhance a tan.

I couldn't resist the very feminine and retro look of the packaging. And it does look cute in the bathroom. That being said this is great to add a layer of sheen to the legs. Your calves look great without stockings. I find it too waxy to use on the rest of the body but there's nothing better on bare legs. To add a glow to the skin, especially to a tan, try Benefit's Flamingo Fancy

I've seen lots of negative feedback on the strawberry milkshake scent, but I have to say I love it.  This lotion takes me back to my child hood.  It's got a strawberry quick/bubblegum smell to it.  I think it's fun for summer days

Clinique's Bare Brilliance is one of my absolute favorite lipsticks ever!
It has a fairly sheer finish with lovely little sparkles in it.  I have Berrylicious(sheer grape) and Cherry Quartz(sheer, true red--doesn't look like it does on the color swatch) and neither overwhelms my pale skin.  I wouldn't be caught dead without a Bare Brilliance lipstick in my makeup bag or purse!

     Here's a gem of an idea for a small gift or stocking stuffer for the preteen girls on your list - a cute lip gloss ring from Hard Candy.

     The ring is heart shaped with a flip top filled with a lightly tinted sparkly lip gloss.  It comes in three shades and glosses - Heartbreaker, which is a peach; Kiss Me, which is hot pink, and Yummy, which is baby blue.  All are fruit scented.

      Boxed in a ring box with a faceted lid (presentation, you know), it's finger fun

Mastering the stencils does require some practice...but the color is good for blondes.  I also follow up the powder with an eyebrow pencil to make my eyebrows look a little more defined.  I think my eyebrows look better since using this product

After watching Anastasia do eye brows on TV i decided that i needed to get this item and try to do better shaping of my eye brows.  After receiving this kit, i found that is is quite hard to do by yourself.  Holding the stencil in the proper alinement is difficult for one person to do on themselves.  I do however shape my daughters brows.  In conclusion i think that it takes a lot of skill and i think it would be better to go to her personally or some other experienced person.

One time while in Los Angeles, I had the forward thinking enough to book an appointment with Anastasia because I'd seen her on Oprah and in magazines and knew she was Queen of the eyebrows.  I thought if I had one appointment, I could maintain them afterward myself.  If you live nowhere near Bev Hills or aren't going to be in LA, this is the next best thing.  It's like having her in your home permanently.
The kit is fantastic.  There are different colours to choose from and it's easy to use.  It does look a little weird at first if you use the colour where there are no brows, but I don't know if everyone can tell, or we girls are just a little more fussy when it comes to ourselves.
This is the best way to get the perfect shape and it really DOES make a difference to your face.  You'll look better and ultimately feel better.  The stencil is the best invention and I highly recommend it

This powder is great. It has great coverage without looking cakey. I also have sensitive skin and this has never bothered me. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it's still a little dark for very light skin and it needs to be "touched-up" a little more often than other powders I've tried, but it's worth it

If you have smooth skin, this product is not for you. 

My skin had no human quality about it; after I went through many procedures of bleaching and laser treatments. I suffer from extreme skin dryness, uneven and dull skin. Other lotions made my face look greasy, or failed to give it that moisturised look.

I have tried many products, for my extreme dry dull skin issues, and this is the first product that has worked for me. Now my skin looks hydrated and normal. It is quite a feat

I was recommended this product for my son's hair and have had many recommendations over the years, since he has beautiful thick curly hair that can tend to be dry and frizzy.  I used a little of this product in his wet hair and it leaves it shiny with less frizz and more curls.  He is 10 and not crazy about the smell, but I think it smells nice.  Fantastic product

I purchased this product based on the reviews, and I can't begin to tell you how glad I am to have the Hair Honey.  It is wonderful!!  It leaves my hair looking absolutely healthy and bouncy.  The smell was overwhelming at first but the benefits of what the product does for your hair are far greater.

I will be using this for a long time to come

I just started using Carols Daughters products but I really like the Hair Honey as an everyday moisturizer for my ends and to smooth my natural hair in the front. I just use a little water and hair honey, tie a scarf for about ten minutes, and my all-natural new growth is smooth, soft, and exactly where I want it to be without using harsh gels, sprays, or spritzes. I am using this and the CD Healthy Hair Butter as a leave-in. I love the fact that its all natural ingredients that are really great and yummy for the hair.

Forgive me for the rhyme, but the sentiment is true.  This product is rich, but at the same time light.  After opening the jar, I loved the way the Hair Honey smelled, it has a sweet aroma but I didn't detect the "cirtus" smell in the product description.  I am only sorry I didn't get the larger size.

I originally bought this item because I was hoping for the same scent that Yankee candle produces in their candle line.  The smell is nice, although it doesn't reach out and grab you like true buttercream.  Still, it's nice to shower with and you won't be disappointed with the lather.  I put a quarter sized amount on my shower puff and still had to ring out foam from it after I was finished.  Also, the lather is creamy and it just feels like it is moisturizing your skin.  All in all, I am happy with my purchase.  I only gave 4 stars because I like a stronger scent, but if you like more subtlety I'm sure you'll enjoy it

This concealer comes in a pencil form, so it is very precise and offers very good coverage.  It stays on well.  It is more waxy and not as soft and creamy as most concealers, so you can put it in a small, precise spot and it will actually stay there.  I have tried many concealers for small blemishes, and this is my favorite.  It comes in enough shades so you can find a good match, which is important

 wear make up every day, and I usually wear foundation, eyeliner, mascara, eyeshadow and lip gloss. That's my every day make up. By the end of the day I have to get it off in order to sleep well. Lancome make up remover helps me a lot. Its very easy to use,it takes off make up quickly and without scrubbing. It's gentle and not irritating. It also smells nice. Though it's kind of expensive, it's a good product.

The emotionally healing benefits of orange oil and lavender become immediately apparent when you apply this to your scalp. If you can find someone to give you a head massage with this product, then you can truly relax. If applying this yourself, it works well as an at home hair treatment to nourish the hair follicles and promote healthy hair growth. You will also notice your hair becoming stronger and retaining a much deeper shine. The essential oils in this product help to activate micro-circulation which may cause a slight tingling and warming of the scalp. Leave this in for about 5-10 minutes and then wash your hair as normal. You may find you need less conditioner when using this product. Many hairdressers will use this product when giving a conditioning head massage and that is where I first found out about this product. I bought my first bottle the day I had the massage. I was that impressed and I keep buying this product.

I use this everyother day before shampooing. My hair is much less greasy after using it!! I've also noticed that my hair seems to have more body at the roots. It also has a very pleasant orange/citrus scent. This product is worth every cent. I definitely recommend it for those with oily scalps and thinning hair

For those bored with the same old bottles of shampoo an hair products at their local drugstore this is a fun new way of washing their hair with no chemicals and natural botanicals that truly do wonders and enhance every single hair.

This solid shampoo bar works wonderfully; I had my doubts just like everyone else, and was worried that this would remove the build up but leave the hair overly squeaky clean and stripped, and if it would later at all. To my surprise this small disc turns into an avalanche of bubbles once I wet it and rub it between the hands. I also wet my hair and rub the bar all over, working with the lather form my hands and the lather from the wet bar. I have to admit that this produces more lather than liquid shampoos and washes the hair without leaving it feeling like it was tortured, instead its slippery and wonderfully light. Afterwards I follow with the American Cream conditioner (probably the best hair scented product in the universe) also from Lush for a head of hair that feels rich and buttery soft, with a fresh light fragrance that lingers on.

The scent itself is wonderful, citrusy and earthy, with Patchouli Oil, Orange Oil, Lavendin Oil, Pine Oil , Lemongrass Oil , Elemi Oil , Gardenia Extract and the Roman Chamomile Flower. I often find that all the oils and rich botanicals nourish the hair and leave it feeling happy, organic and natural products have been of high interest to me lately because of the results they deliver for bouncy hair and supple skin. After using drugstore and even expansive brands of hair products and skin potions, I find that my skin and hair never really benefited from all those preservatives and unnatural products derived from mineral oils and god knows what else. Lush and Burt's Bees, Jason and The Body Shop made me change my mind and seek out products that are as good as they smell, and that truly transform me from a sleepy duckling in the morning to a happy princess by the time my morning routine is over.

I JUST got out of the shower a minute ago, and I must say this is the best shampoo I've ever bought. My scalp hasn't felt this clean and fresh in a long time. Washing my super-thick and waist length hair didn't feel like a chore for once, and I actually look forward to my next washing. The smell reminds me of the hippie shops on Haight Street in San Francisco. I love it

For a mirror shine and one that doesn't disappear on the rim of a glass with the first sip my choice is MAC. Lipglass feels good on your lips, as if it contained some emollients. And (this is a big AND) it's not tacky or sticky. 

The colors are a veritable palette of shades to suit every mood, occasion and skin tone. They range from a playfully innocent baby-doll nude to a dramatic dark diva red. 

Another plus (and this is a big PLUS following the big AND) MAC Lipglass is so price accessible that you can easily pick a bouquet of these delicious shades. Try adding a Lipglass over a country cousin lipstick for a wow impact. 

Enjoy!

I received this a a gift for Valentine's Day this year.  It's a nice bubble bath with lots of foam (rather than big, double bubbles).  It's chock full of natural ingredients and no SLS so it's very gentle- even for little ones.  I do however prefer the Deep Steep in the calming lavender chamomile or energizing rosemary mint.

I used to sell Iman when it was in a major department store.  This stuff would fly off the shelves.  Too bad it was hardly ever in stock which made many customers go to something else.  I stuck with it for 10 years now and would not dare use anything else!  Buy it - you will not be disappointed

Knowing how I love everything pink, a dear friend of mine gave this to me as a present. I love the scent, it's not overpowering but has that lovely and alluring smell. It's so fragrant and I feel like I'm forever in a garden full of freshly-bloom beautiful pink roses. 

One of the simple pleasures in life - Truly Pink by Vera Wang. 

Leave a scent of you behind. 

Wholeheartedly recommended.

Face Oasis isn't like any other moisturizer I've tried - One application makes my skin appear plump and well-hydrated even if I've neglected to drink my 8 glasses of water that day.  It isn't at all greasy, absorbs quickly, and serves as a great base over which to apply my makeup. The guys I've introduced it to have raved about it as well!

I have thick in-between wavy and straight hair that is also dry and frizzy. Other curl enhancing lotions I have tried have made my hair feel crunchy, hard and sticky, yuck! Not this one. After I wash and condition my hair I apply this spray to almost dry hair, scrunch it and let it air dry. It gives my otherwise limp, frizzy waves definition, lift and bounce. It even adds shine and smells great, sort of like watermelon. It also looks more natural and is much easier than having to use a curling iron. The spray is easy to use and you can't really use too much of it, which is a problem I've had with other products. In between washes I just spray my hair with water and scrunch it to reactivate the waves.

I always liked the way my hair looks after a swim in the ocean and drying in the sea breeze. Unfortunately I couldn't do that every day but now I can get the look with Fekkai's Wave Creating Spray. The underneath part of my hair has some natural curl and waves. I spray it on damp hair, scrunch and air dry and although it doesn't dry in a toussle of Renaisannce waves and perfect (bong!) ringlets, it really amps up the curls and waves and gives me that beachy look. There' not a crunch factor either although if you keep spraying it on dry brushed out hair the hair can tend to get dryed out. It does add spring and holds well. I don't know how it would work on very straight hair since the top part of my hair doesn't want to respond much. But it works nicely on enhancing what Mother Nature gave you.

So I was a little suspicious of this product at first; eye creams seem to be the most benign things on the market.  When the beauty consultant put this on my face I let her just to be obliging not really expecting anything.  We continued to talk about her products and I realized that I was feeling burning under my eyes (not painful just noticeable) and she said :"See look it is working already!"  I looked and saw nothing but it felt good and she was kinda high pressure so I bought it.  When I got to the car and looked at myself I could see a definite improvement.  The skin under my eyes was tighter, it was still dark under my eye but without all the baggage it was much improved.  So I think that if I use this product and put my concealer on over it I am going to notice a huge difference.  Highly recommended

i'm so happy that this product finally made its way here in the states. i was introduced to this particular brand a few years ago by a friend when i went to visit her in osaka, and i've been hooked since.

i'm one of those unfortunate few who for some reason or the other always end up with "panda eyes" at the end of the day due to mascara run-off. i've tried everything from cheap to expensive, and from regular to waterproof mascaras to no avail. somehow though, this mascara, because of the unique properties of the fibers will not smudge on the skin, no matter how humid or wet the day is. the cool thing about it is that if you rub your eyes the fiber will fall, but not stain the skin, thus eliminating the panda eye effect. the fibers will coat the eyelashes and dry up, forming a sort of tube around the lashes and are surprisingly easy to clean at the end of the day, no special solutions needed. when you clean your eyelashes you can actually see the fibers loosen up and leave your lashes without any residue.

i am also a contact lens wearer and this product, unlike many other mascaras, doesn't irritate my eyes and lasts practically forever.

this has to be the best mascara i have used yet, and that is saying something. even the expensive department store and specialty mascaras pale next to this. and i even bought it at a local japanese drugstore!

never leave home without it; it's possibly the last mascara you'll ever need

I was a bit weary at trying a Shampoo Bar, but as soon as I took a whiff of this little hockey-puck of sunshine, I was sold.  The scent is strong - so watch out if strong florals give you headaches - so strong, in fact, I can smell the jasmine and honeysuckle wafting out of the shower at this very moment.  When I had it in the bag, fresh from purchase, it scented the entire living room!  The conditioning agent isn't enough for people who use deep conditioners -  I recommend following up the shampooing with a seperate conditioner.  But the Fragrance and ease of rubbing a bit of soap onto wet hair, achieving masses of luscious lather, a quick rinse and go - Priceless!  This is definately a little gem that everyone should try

HI

<review_text>
I work retail so I'm on my feet for hours at a time.  Throughout the day, my feet sweat (yes, gross I know... but there's no smell), so gave LUSH's T For Toes a try.  I noticed a huge difference the first time I tried it.  For my whole shift, I wasn't able to feel any moisture on my feet at all!!  My feet and toes felt as fresh as it did when I first started work.  

The dusting powder is made with real Tea Tree oil, so it works as an antibacterial agent as well.  It's supposed to handle stinky feet as well, and my boyfriend swears by it.  He works construction and uses it everyday and loves it because it's not girly smelling and even the packaging is not girly, so he doesn't mind leaving it at work.

T for Toes is a wonderful product and you only need to use a real little bit

Like most others, I fell for all the hype that convinced me that every couple of years, I had to buy the latest, greatest design in razors.  With each new design, the blades got more and more expensive until I realized that it was just a gimmick to get more of my hard earned money.  About a year ago, I bought a Merkur razor and have not regretted it.  If you are a newbie to this type of razor, you may want to start off slow and make minor changes to your technique.  Then, enjoy your smooth shave and think about what to do with the extra money in your pocket

I have hard facial hairs (Thanks Dad!!) and after being Gilette user (last used Mac 3), I finally decided to go back to classic style of shaving with Double Edge (DE) razor and blades. Merkur are the first ones I have used after the multi-edge blades and after 4-5 shaves, I am getting closer shaves (w/ no irritation) than by using mutli-edge ones. Also, to get better results, I would recommend a "Badger" brush which really softens the skin before these DE blades with a good heavy razor (Merkur is a good one) can smoothly get your facial stubs. Good luck !

This is the second time I have ordered these blades for my husband. He has a very heavy beard and says these are the only razor blades he's ever used that last anywhere near this long, regular blades dull almost right away (sorry he's not here or I'd ask for the details from him, I don't know how long "a long time" is) but at 50, he's tried a lot of blades! He says never buy him anything else again so I guess these are the best!!!

With the advent of those truly ridiculous multiblade "shaving systems" (oh, no--not "razors"; they're "shaving systems." Feh.), Merkur blades are a welcome standby. They can be had by the full case (20 10-blade packs) for about $80 or $90. And at about a week per blade, even with "two-pass" shaving (once with the grain of the beard and once against it), that's enough for a few years.

I've been using Merkur blades for almost 25 years, and for overall quality and value, I'd say they're the best around. I've found them best when teamed with the Merkur "Progress" adjustable razor. Using both correctly furnishes the best shave next to a straight razor, and without all of the trouble (well, "enjoyment" for the straight razor aficiandoes) inherent in that practice.

This luxurious milky, creamy and rich cream smells like an island made of coconuts, not overly sweet but luscious and truly indulgent, it pours out and can be used with scrubbing gloves ( also sold by The Body Shop) or simply on it's own to envelop the skin in a coat of soft cleansing lather.

This product has actual coconut oil which I also use on it's own, my boss who is a gorgeous Indian woman gets me coconut oil from her local supermarket and she told me to heat it up in the microwave for 15 seconds and then apply to dry hair, massaging into the scalp and letting it sit as long as I can before shampooing out twice to find my hair shiny and luxuriously full of volume and softness. The same oil is really amazing on the skin, not only does it smell like coconut milk with powdered milk mixed together but is wonderful on dry winter days when my skin wants to turn red and be irritated.

Fabulously creamy and comforting this indulgent cream settles me in for a cozy and warm night, because there's nothing better than a warm shower with a great product that makes me want to jump into a clean, fuzzy bed and dream of sweet things.

This product is awesome; nice texture, great tingling feeling, and very smooth/clean feeling after use. But I'm not sure if you should use it daily, as exfoliators should only be used 2-3x/week because they're too abrasive. So just remember that. Otherwise, this is definitley a top notch exfoliator.

I wasn't so sure about the claims that this shampoo bar would make my hair super shiny, but I didn't really care either way because it smells very nice and I just like relaxing while I try to wake up (or wind down) in the shower. Anyway, it did make a difference! My hair has been noticeable shinier while using this stuff, though I would try Lush's "BIG" shampoo if you want to see an even bigger difference.

Perfect format for brining with you to the gym or travelling - nothing to spill! Make sure you get one of the little travel tins to bring with you so it doesn't soap everything in your gym/travel bag :)

My only complaint is that it only lasted about a week for me. I have medium-long hair, and didn't use that much. I haven't tried my other shampoo bar yet, so I don't know if that's more of a problem just for this particular bar, or if it's a problem across the board. Read the reviews and find out!

like all lush shampoo cakes, it does a great job in cleaning hair and is nice and sudsy. I find the smell to be nothing to write home about. Yes, my hair was shiny, but it tends to be with all of their products. Don't be scared of the glitter though, it's barely there.....all in all, I prefer New and Karma Komba to this one.

During the winter months I have flaky skin under my beard and on my face.  This product has prevented that problem the last 3 winters that I've used it.  I'd recomend for that use.  I don't think it has much of a scent at all.  Certainly not like most soaps and skin care products.

As someone who really dislikes making up, but needs a bit of cover in her face powder, I have found Clinique's Superpowder to be just the right product. I have been using it for nearly ten years. In between Superpowder purchases I have tried other lesser brands and have always returned to this product. It is truly no muss, no fuss. No foundation, or concealers, just a nice simple matte powder that sets in naturally. No powdery bits sitting on the skin surface, no flaking ... and stays on all day with nary a touch up ... just perfect

This cologne smells great. A guy I know wears it and whenever he hugs me I smell this and well, he smells fantastic. In fact, the way he smelled was one of the first things that interested me in him. I'm a big fan of the original Curve cologne, which smells really nice as well...boys/men can't go wrong wearing either of them

I've heard lots of stories about people using beer on their hair and I will admit to trying it once. Cynthia Sylvia Stout is a much more pleasant experience with beer blended with fresh lemon juice, cognac oil and lemon oil. It looks a little like a chocolate syrup and I didn't think it had a very strong beer scent. 

Strangely enough, the scent sort of reminds me of freshly made whole wheat yeast dough (perhaps with a hint of lemon zest), which is currently baking in my bread baker. This is a very cleansing shampoo that you might want to use when your hair is misbehaving and needs a little shine and control. You may only need to shampoo once since this really cleans well the first time. 

Using this with the Veganese conditioner will leave your hair feeling super clean and not overly conditioned. If you want a deeper conditioning experience, try American Cream conditioner which is simply intoxicating. Please don't make me live without it! 

While I enjoyed using Cynthia Sylvia Stout shampoo, I still think my first love is Rehab shampoo (the scent of Rehab is divine). This shampoo did make my hair feel silky and soft so I'll definitely buy it again.

I am a big Lush fan - but Cynthia Sylvia Stout shampoo is my favorite product!

It does smell VERY strongly of beer when you use it, so if you have an aversion to that smell, you won't like this.  At first I didn't like the smell, but now I think it's sort of a nice "wake up."  I don't smell it on my hair when it's dry as other reviewers have noticed - although I use (non-Lush) conditioner afterwards, so maybe that tends to wash the smell away?

This shampoo makes my hair SO shiny.  I have long blonde hair, and it really makes it glow like nothing else.  I don't know how it does it...but people will literally come up to me and comment on how nice and shiny my hair looks on the days I use this product!  

Oh, and this shampoo is very concentrated - a little goes a long way.  So, think of it as though you're getting twice as much when factoring the price in.  It's still expensive, but I think it's a great product when you need a little splurge

This shampoo totally fulfilled its promise of bright, shiny hair for me. I have nice hair to begin with (if I do say so myself), but I used this in conjunction with one of Lush's conditioners(American Cream)and my friends told me I had shampoo model hair that day. I'm not crazy about the beer-ish smell,which is why I'll give it a four rating.However, it doesn't seem to be very strong once you wash it out and the benefit is worth it

I'm a sort of sweaty type, so I usually like an antiperspirant/deodorant, but sometimes the antiperspirant ingredients give me a rash, and it's really not practical to use them all over everywhere on every single part of your body that might get whiffy. Aromarant is quick and easy to use, doesn't make you itchy or rashy no matter where you use it, and works so well as a deodorant that it makes you want to do an infomercial for it free of charge

Does anyone remember being told that freckles were beauty marks? Do believe I was told this numerous times as I tried eveything to banish the light spray of freckles across my nose. Well, those nose freckles did eventually disappear but in their place came sun spots on my hands.
Gardening is one of my hobbies, and I love to be out of doors. I know, I know - wear garden gloves. For me, digging in the dirt isn't enjoyable in gloved hands. Hence, sun spots.

Over a period of weeks Cellex-C Fade Away Gel has markedly faded the most obvious spots. It isn't oily so I apply the gel to the sun spots twice a day, in the morning and at night. 

By remembering to apply sunscreen to my hands before going outside I think I'll be able to maintain the beneficial effects of this gel.

I have been usinghte same two for years now and I gotta tell you, washclothes come and go but these still look almost new after all these years.  I am  so glad I can stock up on these!!  Buy them, you will ove them.  I have ultra sensitive skin and these washclothes are outstanding for exfoliating

I love this cleanser!!! I have combination skin and I sometimes have breakouts, especially when I am stressed. This cleanser is great because it sloughs off the dead skin without irritation. I also love how it doesnt dry out my skin! And I have a lot less breakouts now, and when I do, its not as bad as it used to be. Even if you have sensitive skin, this cleanser is perfect, of course there are other great cleanser options if you think this will irritate your skin. Also, this cleanser really helps to minimize/clean out your pores. I really noticed a difference after using it for only a week.
I also recommend the Perfecting Lotion especially if you have slightly oily skin. I use it during the day and even at night(!)because it really improves my skin and I dont wake up with zits in the morning :)Plus, It saves me money since i dont have to by an acne treatment gel to put under my lotion

lipstick going. This review is for the Guava Stain shade. I first bought this lipstick, I believe in the mid to late eighties. I was delighted with it then and am now. It is sheer, light, non greasy and the color never changes. The color is NOT neutral, but I find that I can wear it with almost any color of clothing except primarily pink or red outfits. Over the years it has become just about the only lipstick shade I wear. I would buy different brands,different shades and wear them maybe once then back to Guava Stain. It along with Clinque's soft pressed blush in New Clover, orginally bought about the same time as the lipstick have become my favorites, and the one's I reach for time and again. They are my dependables. Daytime wear for sure, not night, this is a subtle sheer color

I bought this for a frriend and she love it so, I have to give it 5 since it was not that expensive, the only problem I had was the item was not giftwrap as I pay 2.99 to have giftwrap and it wasn't.  So  the gift wrapping option does not work very well with the seller

For those with dry, tight and thirsty skin or perhaps for any phases and changes in the texture and comfort level of their usually good skin this is the balm of the Gods as I call it. The cream comes in a slick white tube with a gold and orange stripe at the top and can be squeezed out like toothpaste as the thick metal tube lets me get to the very last bit at the end, a total bonus since I hate wasting product.

Expensive, but well  worth it since Dr. Hauschka products are extremely natural and healing in their properties with no harsh chemicals disguised by pink dyes and fragrances. This cream smells like a pale pink Bulgarian rose garden, something I got to experience as a child as it makes me smile twenty years later as I used this cream. Winter and high times of stress or freaky dry skin episodes are the usual scenarios that would require me to use this cream as I usually stick to my favorite green tube of Cetaphil lotion as my day and night moisturizer ever since I got it from my dermatologist who did wonders to my complexion two years ago.

Great as a face cream and also wonderful as eye cream, especially when the computer I use at work always seems to suck any moisture form my eye area right out. This patted right on top of makeup refreshes and plumps up the skin, and only a tiny bit is needed. This cream lasts for months so at this price it's really a bargain considering that what I put on my face always shows up as results or neglect if the wrong product is use.

Subtle yet powerful! I LOVE this scent. I actually used the entire bottle instead of using half of the bottle, getting sick of it and then purchasing a new fragrance.  Many compliments from men & women. A little spritz does the trick! You can also purchase a sheer moisturizing  body spray. Perfect for daytime wear ~ especially during the summer.  Pricey, but definately worth it!!

...if you don't use this stuff! After too many years of uncomfortable shaves and having to wait 2-3 days between shaving to let my raw, sore neck recover, I finally started to do some research into what I could add to my regimen/technique to improve results. I read numerous articles about the benefits of pre-shave oil, so I decided to add this stuff to my arsenal...and I'm NEVER going back.

First off, the price might be a detrement to those who are used to $3/can drug store shaving cream, but a little goes a long way, and this little bottle might actually last you longer than 4 or 5 cans of cream or gel. You only use a small amount each day, and it spreads evenly over your whole face. When used in tandem with a good shaving cream, it virtually eliminates razor burn and uncomfortable shaving. My razor glides over my face each morning now. If you look at your razor each morning with disgust like I used to, give this stuff a shot. I guarantee you won't be disappointed. Try their shaving cream and "old school" shaving brush as well. Pamper your face...this is how shaving was supposed to be before cheap aerosol shaving cream and disposable plastic razors started ripping our faces to shreds

I am actually an employee for L'Occitane (pronounced Lox-ee-tahn; that's the question i get asked every day! lol). I have only been working for the company at their Santa Barbara store for about 2 weeks, and this is what I've learned about the Artemesia Shampoo: This IS the shampoo that ALL Four Season's Carry. The packageing may seem different if you were at a four season's in another country, but this is the ONLY shampoo of ours that they carry (once in a while people dont believe me, but TRUST me- they train us on which one it is).  People come in everyday for this shampoo because they loved it so much at the four seasons.  In fact, the company SOLD OUT and our store (which ran out quickly because there is a four seasons in Santa Barbara) had many unhappy customers because they couldnt find it.  The scent is heavenly and lasting on your hair. Some other products you might want to try out? The four Seasons also carrys our Verbena Shea Soap, Verbena body lotion, and our Lavender linen water (which makes clothes smell great when used in ironing). Also, just to let you know, this week we're getting new products for our Honey line (btw- try the honey body balm- I'm HOOKED) including a cleanser, milk bath, and honey massage nectar. Hope this information helps some of you- Enjoy!

I have tried many different products and this one is the best. I rely on it for many years already and it always works faster than anything else I have tried. Four Stars because it leaves a thin barely but visible film on the skin where you apply it. You can gently blend it with a facial brush after it dries so then its no problem. Especially if under makeup

       Powdered eye shadows have not been high on my list of must-haves, primarily because they  tended to crease in a few hours and looked a bit artificial.   What a happy surprise to find Paula Dorf's Eye Color Glimmer that comes in powder form but is actually creamy so that it goes on smoothly and does not crease.

	Her line of Glimmer shadows have a hint of gold in them - not too much but just enough for a sun kissed effect.  Another plus for these Glimmer shadows is that they can also be used to contour or line.  For lining simply use a moistened eye liner brush.

	There's a lovely palette of shades to choose from depending upon day or dramatic evening wear.  "Nymph" is an appealing innocent blue, while "Hypnotic" is ready for a night on the town

What a great modern selection of elegant colors and what a perfectly textured eye shadow. Paula Dorf says "Where are the brights? Not here" and calls the shadows "softly muted". That is true but don't take that to mean there is no life to this shadow. It's also named Glimmer and it does have a slight velvety glimmer to it. The selection of very wearable colors has a shade for everyone. I bought the gold, which is subtle but is still gold. I love the way it goes on and it's suitable for day or night. Paula Dorf will never have you looking like a clown but I don't find these shades boring either.

I absolutely love this Chanel foundation.  It is lightweight and yet provides fair to good coverage.  I like this foundation because it does not feel heavy and it is water-based.  It can be worn in the daytime or evening.  Use with Chanel loose powder and Chanel concealer for a perfectly flawless finish

For a mirror shine and one that doesn't disappear on the rim of a glass with the first sip my choice is MAC. Lipglass feels good on your lips, as if it contained some emollients. And (this is a big AND) it's not tacky or sticky. 

The colors are a veritable palette of shades to suit every mood, occasion and skin tone. They range from a playfully innocent baby-doll nude to a dramatic dark diva red. 

Another plus (and this is a big PLUS following the big AND) MAC Lipglass is so price accessible that you can easily pick a bouquet of these delicious shades. Try adding a Lipglass over a country cousin lipstick for a wow impact. 

Enjoy!

Due to the ravages of 60 years worth of gravity, nursing babies, and losing a LOT of weight, the "girls" need a little help. (Actually, they need a LOT of help, but we won't go there!) I have worn bra inserts from the fabric store, the ones that kind of remind you of a shoulder pad. They do the job, but create a line across the bra cup and have to constantly be adjusted during the day. I LOVE the silicone inserts. Iinserted in your bra, they look like the real deal and, since they cling to your skin, they stay in place all day. I call them my "ex-plants!" Love 'em!

I have tried so many products out there to firm up the area under my eyes and nothing has worked.  Initially I was a little skeptical cause of my lack of success with other products.  I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised.  It certainly has improved the look of the skin around my eyes.  It may seem  expensive, but a little goes a very very long way.  Has a nice texture and easily absorbs and not the least big irritating...and I have sensitive skin.  Try it...I don't think you'll be disappointed.  I wasn't

This concealer comes in a pencil form, so it is very precise and offers very good coverage.  It stays on well.  It is more waxy and not as soft and creamy as most concealers, so you can put it in a small, precise spot and it will actually stay there.  I have tried many concealers for small blemishes, and this is my favorite.  It comes in enough shades so you can find a good match, which is important

My boyfriend always got ingrown hair on his neck, and he was very skeptical about using this. Now he  doesn't get any ingrown hairs and he doesn't pick at them anymore.  He will not live without it now, and we both recommend it!

Tend skin was introduced to me for after waxing ingrown hairs.  But, she said the secret was that it stopped itching from mosquito bites and within 24 hrs any pimple and just blooming pimple are gone!!!  I introduced this to friends at work and now everyone uses it.  We all have clearer skin when nothing else ( even pro-active) didn't work

I don't know why nobody else likes this product, but so far it's the only one that works for my ingrown facial hairs..

Yes, it stings a bit when I put it on, but it quickly goes away.
It doesn't dry my skin out, it actually helps get rid of the dry, white-looking flaky skin after I shave.

I used to get ingrown hairs so bad on my face that they would be there for MONTHS. Eventually I'd get to the point of having to do my own surgery with a needle to try and extract the hair.

If I get an ingrown hair now, I just use Tend Skin once in the morning and once before bed, and it actually extracts the hair on it's own! It gets rid of the redness and swelling also associated with ingrown hairs.
For the only time in my life my face actually looks clear, and Tend Skin is the product that has done it for me.

Before I finish, I'd just like to add that I'm the kind of person that NOTHING ever works on. Any product I try, never does as advertised. Whether it be shampoo, deodorant, medication, etc.
Tend Skin is one of the rarities that actually DOES work for me.
And believe me, I've tried a LOT of products for ingrown hairs

I'm sooo happy with all 3 of these scents.  The candy apple is definitely the most accurate and I'd sell my soul if I could only continue buying it on its own.  But the other 2 are good, too.  The cotton candy is awesome but not 100% on accuracy and the cherry sno-cone makes me start slobbering when I smell it.  Highly recommended

This stuff is awesome if you have dry, coarse, or damaged hair.  This is lush, creamy and lathers up well. This is a wonderful luxury shampoo. You will feel like a queen/star when you wash your hair with this. The smells is fresh and yummy. I love using this stuff except I cannot use this every day as it will weigh my hair down. My hair is fine and straight and has some natural wave in the back. I highly recommend this product and will buy it again

I originally wanted the Black Ginger Aromatic Candle, but after reading the reviews it seemed that the Red Currant is the all around favorite.  The smell is nice, but I think I expected something a bit different.  The candle's scent does travel throughout my home like others have stated, and it seems to be burning slowly.  The candle itself is fine quality, and comes packaged nicely!  If I found a scent that I liked a bit better I would be 100% pleased

I received the Soku Lime candle as a gift and was so thrilled!  The box itself is decorative and I re-used it as a pencil holder on my desk. The scent is very aromatic and long lasting. I had relatives over and they remarked on the scent as soon as they entered my house. I was very pleased.

I have tried every shampoo and conditioner on the market and was dissatisfied with the results until trying this combo. My curls are well formed and bouncy and I use less styling product. Plus this line smells great! It has a light citrusy smell that I wish they'd bottle into perfume. I even got my boyfriend (who has curly hair like mine) to buy and use these products by letting him sample mine. I am hooked

When I was a little girl, I would watch my Mother take her makeup off at her dressing table.  Cold cream and soft cloth tissues.  A gentle misting of water and then another dabbing with cloth.  Then night cream, eye cream ("dab on gently, never rub"), a special lotion for her throat and collarbone area.  She would impart her beauty secrets to me while I sat transfixed.  Although I was convinced that she was the most beautiful woman in the world, I was surprised that with all these lotions and oils, she didn't' slide right out of bed at night.  "Exercise, Sweetheart.  Drink lots of water.  Never go to sleep in your makeup--no matter how tired you are.  Never wash your face with regular soap.  Moisturize, moisturize, moisturize.  Your skin has to last you a lifetime and nothing gives away a woman's age like uncared for skin."  While I am not sure where I would even find 'cold cream' today, I follow the vast majority of her regimen.  The two items that I use for under my eyes are Avon's Repair Eye Serum and Hydrofirming Bio6 Eye Cream.  The cream plumps up and firms the delicate tissue around the eye, and the serum smoothes and moisturizes the skin.

I consider Avon products to be the unsung work horses of the beauty industry.  They almost always do exactly what they say they are going to do and at a very modest price.   Expensive boutique and department store products rarely do a better job and are usually exorbitantly overpriced.   When you factor in that Avon products go on sale regularly (which is when I usually stock up), you are getting an even better deal for your money.  While I am not a complete cheapskate, I love a bargain and I want to feel like I am getting full value for my money.

The skin around the eyes is quite thin and delicate, so I think if you follow my Mother's advice and "dab on gently, never rub" Avon's Repair Eye Serum and Hydrofirming Bio6 Eye Cream you will be able to keep this area smooth, without being greasy, even with the most drying of climatic conditions

I've been using Avon products since I was a teen.  I started using the eye serum a couple of years ago after Avon discontinued their wonderful eye gel.  I will be 60 this year and have no wrinkles around my eyes and few on my face either, though I am a dry-skinned redhead. 

Contrary to what someone else here said, I find that it does absorb very quickly.  I buy it because it is NOT oily--oily makeup around my eyes makes my eyes burn, and this gives me no problems at all.  Also, I have sensitive skin so I have to use hypoallergenic makeup.  This fills that bill too.  Try it!!  It's great!!

I agree with the reviewer who likened it to actual lemon juice.  It is very strong, and I realized after spraying it twice it only needed once... most likely because it is an eau de parfum and not eau de toilette.  Very much worth the money.  I was complimented on it the entire day. It does not resemble lemon Pledge to me at all

I tried the lemon sugar perfume and I am absolutly in love with it. It is like no other perfume I have ever smelled before. I will probably be using it the rest of my life, I hope they never stop making it. I think everyone should try it. The scent is lemony and sugar just like it says. It is light and last a very long time. I am already going to order a bigger bottle tomorrow. Do not just take my world for it, order it today and experience something great and new

I could never expect to like a lemon scented perfume,but this one is definately different.

When i first smelt it in the bottle i thought:"Oh,no!Dish soap!",but when i put it on i immediately loved it.

On me it smells like lemon scented candy.It's so fresh and clean!I couldn't stop smelling my wrist!And everytime i smelt it i felt as if i were in a wet garden and lemon blossoms were falling on my skin!

It was a nice alternative to all my candy scented perfumes.
It lasts a long time too and it's affordable,plus it smells like spring!

The best choise to welcome the hot days of the summer,since it will keep you fresh and cool.

A must buy!

This is a very lemony smell, and the sugar takes away the sour 'edge' of the lemon. It is simply only that-lemon and sugar, then it gets warmer and airy throughout the day.If you want to just try it, get a sample size one from ebay, or a mini perfumes website.If your considering the more expensive Clean fragrance but aren't sure about the price, Fresh Lemon Sugar is similar in scent, the only thing being left out is the laundry, 'air' fragrance

Not your typical thick, floral-smelling perfume, this perfume smells exactly like its name advertises--like lemon juice mixed with sugar.  It's a seasonal perfume (I can't imagine smelling like lemons in the winter).  It smells very crisp, fresh, and clean, which I enjoy a lot, but I imagine others would not; the same things I like about this perfume, could smell like a cleaning product to others.  Go to your fridge.  Get a lemmon, squeeze its juice out into a cup and add some sugar.  If you enjoy the smell you get, buy this perfume--I highly recommend it.  If not, stick to something more traditional and vanilla/floral like Ana Sui's "Dolly Girl"

I buy these in bulk, and have done since my darling sister in law gifted me with a boxful of Lush goodies some years back.  

I have terrible circulation.  I get cold and stay that way.  From time to time I'm also an insomniac.  The Wiccy Massage Bar has a cure for both.  The cinnamon leaf is very warming on the skin and the Aduki beans seem to help this warmth penetrate. (They also fall all over the floor if you're not careful...but you wont care..the bar is THAT good). The oil is thick and lovely - but be careful about rubbing up against anything it may stain.  This is one of the reasons I only ever use it before bedtime.  Who cares if it messes up the Cartman Flannel Pajama bottoms?  

Speaking of bedtime...I'm not sure what it is..whether it's the cinnamon or the other essential oils I can't name, but they have a very calming effect.  Much better than yucky smelling lavender.  Helps me get to sleep in no time flat.  

I rub it on the back of my neck and sometimes, even on the underside of my pillow case, for this soft comfy shut eye

After a long day of hunching over my computer at work for 8+ hours and a brutal workout after, I came home tonight and enjoyed the best shower experience I have ever had by myself with a bath bar!  :)  
The cooling sensation of the wiccy magic muscles bar, the cool air in the bathroom, mixed with the warm water of the shower made for a incredibly relaxing, blissful, enjoyable shower.  
I feel great!  I'll sleep great tonight!  This experience has made me a LUSH customer for life

I havent gotten the treatment myself yet but my husband loves it.  Dont rub it on too long or you'll have too much.  It melts quickly when it touches skin.  I love the peppermint/cinnamon mixture scent and he likes the heat it provides.  It leaves a coating of the buttery stuff on your skin, so wear a shirt to bed so it can soak in and moisturize

I bought this after using other Murad products and loving them. I like this, but I wouldn't say I love it. First, it's a bit overpriced. I can get a comparable drugstore product for a fraction of the price. The toner itself is decent, but doesn't seem to clean as deeply as other toners. However, for those who find toners to be a bit harsh, this may be a good option. Non-drying and doesn't have that toner "burn". Overall, a decent product, but not one I am sure I would re-purchase

So glad to find this hard to find item..!  I have tried every kind of polish dryer.. but it did the surface and left a tacky mess underneath .  For Years.. I have used Dry and Shine with the great success.. It goes on like lotion... drys to a haze and you buff it off to a beautiful hard shine...and... dry nails.. 
  I love it!!!  it is magic!!!!

A Clean and refreshing scent. Not heavy at all - its top notes are citrus based, and this is  appropriate for day or night wear. It is one of my favorites. It reminds me a little of Happy for Women, which I love, but don't wear, because of its distinctly feminine smell. Cudos to Clinique. Happy is a terrific man's cologne, it smells clean but not like laundry soap ( which too many men's colognes smell like these days )

I have ordered a few of these as gifts and the recipients are always delighted. Responses I have heard about the products are "Marvelous!", "Heavenly!" and "To Die For!"... and keep in mind that these are ladies who take there bath times seriously!!! The range of "flavors" makes it easy to give this gift again and again. The order always comes pre-wrapped suitable for gift giving. You can't go wrong with giving this as a gift. I give this seller my highest recommendation! Kudos

I light this candle every other day in my bedroom because I enjoy this scent so much.  It is a very light scent, but the smell does fill a room quickly.  If you like the Amazing Grace and Pure Grace lines from Philosophy you will like the "Clean Crisp White" candle. The candle is high quality and comes in a very nice container that I didn't want to throw away.  Great for gifts

know you. You were me. Looking for what seemed to be a simple thing - a scented candle that ACTUALLY smells up the room when you light it. You've bought the cheap ones in the grocery store that sent out the weak scent of, well, grocery store. And some candles smell like spray room deodorizer which smells like what one would use in the toilet which then make you think of poop which is not at all what you were going for in the living room. So then you hit the expensive pretty versions - perhaps even in candle stores with cute waxy names. They are not candles, my friend. They are sculptures. Some fancy ones come with cute packaging and crispy dried flowers. This is when you lose your patience. I DO NOT WANT CRISPY DRIED FLOWERS. I WANT A CANDLE THAT PUMPS A GOOD SCENT ALL OVER A ROOM WHEN I LIGHT IT.

This is it. Votivo. You will walk into the room and that room will smell like the candle. The most universally loved scent is probably Red Currant. I also enjoy Rain. The little glass it comes in makes a cute vase after the candle is done. Plus, they make perfect last minute hostess gifts, as the box is very nice and expensive-looking.

So, Votivo isn't the cheapest candle in the world. They're still cheaper than buying a bunch of cheap candles that stink...weakly stink.

Tweezerman tweezers are by far the best tweezers I've ever purchased. They stay sharp for an incredibly long time making tweezing precise, quick and virtually painless. And when they do go dull, all you have to do is send them in for a free sharpening and in a week or so, they arrive back good as new. You can't beat that!

I'm sure that you don't need any more assurance, but just to let you know, I've had my tweezerman's for over 5 years now. They are still sharp! Plus if you ever were to drop them, they probably wouldn't be significantly damaged. These tweezers are a must have.

Tweezerman tweezers are simply put - The Best - with capital letters!  I bought my first pair at Bed, Bath, & Beyond 2 years ago and I just now broke down to buy another pair because I couldn't even go without them long enough to send them in to be sharpened for free! I tell all my friends (and after one use of mine, they agree) that once you use a Tweezerman you realize that no other tweezers out there even come close to their quality or how well they work.  I have had to fight them out of the clenched fists of quite a few of my friends who have wanted to borrow them. How many times do you make "Rules" for a pair of tweezers?  My number one rule? You can use them, but not take them out of my presence!!  Definitely worth the money - in spades!

The pictures posted here of the Paul & Joe blotting paper compact don't do it justice. The compact is very beautiful, large and all covered in a pretty flower-patterned material. Very feminine, very stylish, very pretty. My only complaint? I wish it had a snap or something so it'd stay closed instead of only folding...

The price is a bit steep at first but fortunately, they did consider refills at an affordable price. In my experience, I haven't found different brands of blotting paper to be very different amongst themselves and this is no exception, it gets the job done adequately, only in a prettier package...

As far as blotting goes, this one blots shine like it should but get it for the stylish case and the convenience of affordable refills

Givenchy's Very Irresistible is magnificent!  Floral, yet spicy overtones with a touch of black current in a rose peony base.  Better than Bob Mackie's "Perhaps" perfume. And infinitely complex, so that the scent is never tiresome.  Irresistible lasts all day and is a fragrance that captivates.  This perfume is different than the typical scents that arrive on the market and well worth a try!

I have shoulder length natural dredlocs and while this didn't lock my hair it did smooth out the flyaways around the crown of my head.  It also has a great light scent that doesn't compete with the other hair care products I use like the vanila leave-in conditioner and the hair butter

This stuff is sooo great. This three-pack set gives you the creme de la creme in men's skincare. The shampoo is wonderful and actually prevent hair loss. The body wash is my favorite...its smells awesome. The after shave is fantastic...soothing and refreshing. I suggest this pack for those who've never used Billy Jealousy or those loyal followers such as myself...this is also a great was for someone to get introduced to Billy Jealousy, this has all the essentials. You will not be displeased, in fact you'll be in awe...you'll be compelled to tell everyone, this also makes a great gift. Billy Jealousy is the absolute best and I've used all upscale lines from department stores, Sephora, and spas...and this stuff is the best

I love this conditioner! It smells divine and it made my hair feel like silk! My hair is ash blonde and i noticed a very slight lift in colour. Regardless, I recommend this product highly, especially for dry, damged hair. I recommend this product in conjunction with "NEW! (Hair) Solid Shampoo Bar", also made by Lush Cosmetics

I've had my marilyn hair treatment for some 3  months and it makes my hair smell great! Kind of like a smooth scent in my hair. It didn't really lighten my hair, but it smells great, and it did add some extra softness to it

Got this sample from a friends mom who worked for a major department store..and I loved it...but I couldn't believe it was a scent from Clinique!

Love that it's light and has little hints of powder and citrus to it.

I definitely recommend this scent...especially for the Springtime.

Great for daytime wear

I purchased the TUI shampoo and conditioner and although it is watery it lathers very well and leaves your hair squeaky clean. I wear my hair natural with no chemicals and it held my natural curls in place the entire day, my hair did not dry out nor did it become poofy all day. I love Carol's Daughter and I am thankful for her products

I was so surprised by this eyeshadow. I usually buy cheap brands from the drugstore but when I tested this on my hand I had to have it! Be Mine is a light, shimmery pink paired with a soft charcoal. Pink usually looks weird on me but this shadow is so soft, smooth and lightweight that it glides on and doesn't look cakey. Since I bought this I hardly wear any of the cheap stuff I own. This is worth the price and now I'm saving up to buy a few more shades

One whiff of this delicious soap and you are transported to a land of pine trees where plates of freshly sliced oranges are served on a bed of lemongrass, surrounded by patchouli candles. This is the best way I can describe the scent that seems to awaken from the night and mingle with memories of exotic honey and wide-open skies. I am not sure where I go when I inhale deeply, but I am no longer in the shower. Follow this with the Skin Sin lotion and you will enter a little bit of heaven on earth. Also delicious to use in a bath with sea salts and patchouli, orange slices optional, but you might crave the taste of oranges while using this soap.

This is my favorite soap in the whole, wide world. It makes me happy when I use it. It smells fresh, like the wind, the ocean, grass, sand. I don't know, it's just the perfect scent. I have both the "karma kream" lotion and karma dusting powder from Lush, and I love them as well, but the soap is still my favorite. Next time I go to their store I'm going to buy the biggest brick of this stuff that I can, because it's great! Just a simple gylcerine-based soap with a dark orange-red hue, but the smell is just so wonderful that every time I wash my hands it turns into some sort of new-age deep-breathing exercise while I try to get as much of that lovely scent into my nostrils as I can.

I've found that this soap lathers better than others, but you have to be careful not to leave it in the shower all the time, or it will get soft and melt away with the condensation. Trust me, you don't want to waste any of this stuff by letting it leak into the drain while other people are using the bathroom! I leave mine out so it can make my bathroom smell really great as an added bonus :)

Fresh, fruity, citrusy, with just a tiny hint of patchouli to give it an earthy note. Definitely a winner from Lush! As soon as I smelled this soap in their store for the first time, I loved this scent. As you can tell from the reviews, a lot of other people do, too

worth every penny. someone gave this red currant soap as a house warming gift and i became obsessed. i really cannot tell you how good of quality these products are. the candles burn forever and really scent the place up, but not in an ovepowering fake way. i can't wait until they make body perfume in red currant. all of them smell good however.

Ive never liked spicy or musky scents, but Im in love with Burberry Brit.  Its got a great musky overtone but its not too heavy like most fragrances like it.  The scent sticks around all day which is also a plus.  I've a;ways used light scents like Romance by Ralph Lauren and CK One but Burberry Brit is easily my new favourite...Im actually here to buy my second bottle..

This is just incredible. Many subtle layers of scents, non of them too strong or overpowering, despite the fact that this will stay with you all day long ( no need to respray, in other words, so it's a great value for the price ). I had  never tried a Burberry product before and quite honestly bought this on a whim because I was running low on cologne ( yes, I'm one of those types who has to wear something different every day ) and wanted to try something different. I am happy to say there is really nothing I can compare it too - and that's a good thing, it's not "samey" like so many men's fragrances out today, and not feminine at all. Very nice.

If you ever wondered what it would be like to wander in a field of violets, then this shampoo gives a lush interpretation of what it would be like to walk through one of Raymond Gehman's photographs. 

The deep purple color is remnicent of crushed blackberries and the scent is a mingling of lemon, coconut, Bergamot and violets. The truth is, this shampoo is one of the best shampoos Lush sells and I think it gives even more body and texture than Rehab. Use this and follow with the Coolaulin conditioner for shiny bouncy hair that is scented with violets and coconut. 

The fragrance follows you around for hours and envelops you in a comforting warmth. This shampoo may have you dreaming about the Purple Haze gift box filled with violet, lavender and blackcurrant items or looking into the "Gratuitous Violets" soap. 

To complete the experience, you may want the "Smitten" hand cream - quite luxurious and comforting. For some reason, the All That Jas bath item worked well with the violet scent so my house is now scented with Jasmine and Violets and I feel like I'm walking in fields of flowers.

This is alittle "heavier" than usual summer skin products, ie
light, and non greasy, but when you are maintaining your tan and or recovering from skin peeling, this cream is rich and works great!  The ingredients are rich and they really make the skin feel smooth.

This is a treat to wear, I alternate it with my Secret Sparkling Lily clear gel deodorant. The Fresh deodorant doesn't dry my skin and my it rubbery feeling but it keeps me from sweating. It smells just like Fresh's Sugar perfume, sweet and lemony, but doesn't last as long, that's why I only gave it 4 stars. It also doesn't cake or pill up like other deodorants. This is my favorite deodorant

I have been using this mascara for years.  I have tried other brands--drugstore varieties as well as department store varieties and have been disappointed with everything else I have ever tried.  Why?  This mascara is smooth; it does not flake off and fall into your eyes.  It does not ever look clumpy.  It is also easy to remove without losing any eyelashes.  I would not say that this mascara will make your lashes "a mile long" or "dangerously thick" or whatever hype you hear from other brands.  Those kinds only ever look like clumpy mascara.  Just a simple nice, natural looking mascara that won't irritate your eyes

This gel-based mascara does an excellent job of creating long, separate, and well defined but natural lashes. If you like your mascara to have some oomph to it, you would want to look elsewhere. For those who can't stand a single clump, you may have found your new favorite! If you've ever gotten a mascara in a slender green tube in a Clinique 'gift with purchase' - this is the one. The one you buy is in a slender and slightly larger silver tube.  You can brush on coat after coat of this gel like wonder and not get a single clump! Wow! This mascara is fiber-free and has been opththalmologist approved for contact lens wearers. The Jet Black is a true black and the Jet Brown is noticeably brown on the wand but looks great on the lashes. As with all long wearing eye makeup products such as mascara, this one needs to be removed with an eye makeup remover.

I don't remember when I first tried this product, but now I've been using it for years and I love it! This is a great eye color base. It goes on smoothly, without rubbing or pulling the skin, and provides a smooth base for powder eye color. I wear it every day under my eye makeup. It makes my eyeshadow last all day without creasing or fading. Plus it comes in many colors to compliment whatever colors of eyeshadow you're wearing. Try it, and you'll love it too

This product is GREAT!!!

I wear it during the day under my moisturizer but the biggest difference is when I put a drop or two on at bedtime. One night I was really beat, too beat to wash my face so I tried putting a little on over everything instead. It worked great. When I wear it at night, my skin looks dewy and fresh and soft like I'm 19 again! (I'm almost 40!) 

I can't say that everyone will have the same results I do. All I know is that I am very, very happy to have found this product!

Great product from a company that only offers innovative wonderful products- this product shouldn't cost this much though.  It costs less at authorized Bb. retail outlets and buying Bb. products online doesn't guarantee the consumer that they're getting authentic Bb., so beware.   Check out www.bumbleandbumble.com for authorized retailers

     I love the shine lip glosses offer but really do dislike the stickiness.  When wearing a gloss lip prints come off on glasses (paper cups are the worst!), napkins, and whoever you've just buzzed.

      Found the answer to the stickies with Chanel's Aqualumiere line.  The lipsticks give the slick shine without the telltale spots.  It can be blotted and still shines.  As if that weren't enough it's SPF15.

     My favorite shade is "Macao," a rosy pink

Only  drawback. It stays wetter on
your face prior to shaving  than the competitive stuff
i.e., AFTA, which dries quickly so you
can get to shaving quicker.

Inis has a very fresh/crisp/clean scent that I love.  It's kind of a subtle scent and not overpowering, which is what I like about it.  It's also very androgynous so a man or woman could wear it.  Whenever I wear it people always sniff and make comments like "what are you wearing?" and "mmm! you smell so good.

Inis has become my favourite perfume, every time I wear it I am always being asked "What perfume are you wearing?" It is light, fresh & fragrant, not overpowering but makes an impression. I have tried lots of perfumes but none compare to Inis. The fact it is not tested on animals is a bonus and also it is not too expensive. Can't recommend it enough. Buy and try

Our local Macy's recently offered free skin typing and the samples to go with it. I really only went to pick up a free moisturizer as I've found with some judicious sampling you don't have to pay for that item. Instead, I fell in love with this soap (and got free moisturizer too-hooray!!)

When the sales rep first handed me the bar soap, I balked. I've known people who've used Clinique but just the idea of washing my face with BAR soap freaked me out. They do offer a liquid version but the rep told me the soap was a better exfoliant. I can't say for sure if that's so but I can say this really is a great face wash. I was addicted after one use. And since it is a bar of soap, you'll get a really great sudsy foam. It has a mild, pleasant scent and it washes off easily. I have the mild version and I just love it. My skin feels clean but never tight and not only does it not cause breakouts, it immediately calmed the one I had. I'll definitely be buying more. 

I do want to add, however, it is drying in the wintertime if you have normal skin and I had to switch to a cream cleanser. It may not be a problem for oily skin. For dry skin, I'd really avoid it in the winter at least.

You still ideally need a makeup remover before the soap. I also became a recent convert to Clinique's Rinse Off Foaming Cleanser. But even if you don't want to use that product, remember that removing your makeup is a separate step.

I'd never bought a perfume above ten dollars when I tried Burberry Brit's Eau de Toilette one day. I couldn't believe how wonderful the scent was, especially after it had been on for a while. I splurged on a bottle which seems set to last me for a long time (even with almost-daily use, it's still mostly full). I consider this to be my signature scent, and get many compliments on it

I got this as a gift.  I had tested the Eau de Parfum version at a department store cosmetics' counter and was less than thrilled, however the EDT was just right for me!  I believe in "signature fragrances", so I'll let this be the signature of one of my many moods..

With the texture of an aloe vera gel, this Hibiscus Enriched Aqua-Collagen-Gel smoothes over the skin effortlessly and penetrates the skin to create some stunning results. Not only will your complexion improve, your skin will firm and tighten to reveal a renewed tone. 

The secrets in this formulation include Hibiscus flower extract, Hibiscus fruit extract, Citrus Junos Peel Oil, Bergamot Fruit Oil, Orange Oil, Collagen and Allantoin. This gel is perfect alone if your skin is combination to oily or can be used along with another moisturizer if your skin is dry. The ingredients seem to balance and soothe the skin and also encourage an anti-aging effect. 

The firming and toning of the skin is truly amazing. This is one product you won't want to live without and you can alternate the various Dr. Ci:Labo Collagen Gels to gain the full benefits of each. 

The Super Moisture Moisturizer is also perfect in the driest of winters and would seem to be essential when living in desert conditions. The Super Moisturizer contains Hyaluronic Acid, Aloe, Lobata Root Extract, Flower Extracts, Grape Leave Extract, Sea Salt and Horse Chestnut.

Rice Bran is the secret to these products and the results are immediately apparent in the texture of your skin. After just one to two uses, you start to notice a sense of calm and order descending upon your formerly sensitive skin. Weeks later you look at your skin and it seems like you are at least ten years younger. The smoothness, clarity and youthful glow truly shows with continued use. 

If you have oily or combination skin, you may be amazed at how balanced your skin is and how you no longer experience the shine breakthrough in your makeup due to the initially drying aspects of other cleansers. 

The Komenuka Bijin Facial Cleansing Foam is very economical and an eighth of a teaspoon is enough for a wonderful face cleansing experience. The ingredients include: Rice Germ Oil, Rice Bran, Coconut Oil, Seaweed, Aloe Algae, Ginkgo Biloba, Matricaria, Yeast, Perilla Ocymoides, Honey, Lithospermum and Fountain Water.

The Moisture Cream goes a long way. The main oils are Rice Germ Oil, Jojoba Oil and Olive Oil. Vitamin E, Rice Bran and Aloe make this a skin-healing treat.

Other products to fall in love with: 

Cleansing Powder - Packets of deep cleansing grains turn silky and creamy when you add water. 

Makeup Remover - A fragrance-free cream that removes makeup and mascara. Based on olive oil. 

UV Cream - Slightly tinted and waterproof, this sunblock also seems to even out skin tone. Could be used as a makeup base if you are looking for a more natural look. 

Hair Shampoo & Conditioner - Thickens fine hair instantly. Removes buildup and leaves your hair feeling luxurious. 

Essence - This is a product that is magical. It can be used for skin healing and it also lightens freckles and age spots.

Used the cleansing foam, then bought the moisture cream.  Whatever is in rice bran is truly wonderful, it cleanses without any dryness and a rosy glow has returned to my skin. Have stopped using my old department store stuff, replacing 4 of those products with just these 2 with better results. Good value on both, they should offer a deal on the shampoo and conditioner too

I absolutely love this fragrance.  When I put this on, I get a warm musky scent that lasts for hours.  I put the spray cologne version of Falling in Love on top to brighten it up a bit when I feel like it.  It is subtle, but I think it is a very sexy and warm scent and not at all overpowering.  Definitely something my husband wants to be near

I was unsure about this item in the store- but took a gamble. I cut 1/3 of the bar up and crumbled it and I wasn't particularly impressed with the smell of it dry. So I grabbed the rest and tossed it all in. Wow! It was so silky and smooth against the skin, I jumped out and grabbed my husband to join me! With some nice classical music on in the background and a Tahitian Vanilla candle- you'll think your back in the womb- all safe and warm. The bubbles didn't last very long, but it leaves the skin silky and comfortable with out a perfumey scent

my first thought on crumbling some of this into my running bath was that it reminded me of bubble baths from when i was kid. there's this really nice subtle clean smell to this bubble bar. i really like that it's not an overpoweringly smelly bubble bar. it's great for those who don't want a flowery bath, but who can't tolerate the overwhelming patchouli in the blue skies bar. i wish i'd bought two of these instead of one of this and one of the blue skies. plus, this is a good bar for mixing with a bath bomb. really probably any bomb would do. good stuff

This was my first Lush experience and now I am hooked. Something about the scent of this bubble bar relaxes me like nothing else. It didn't smell like hot (coconut) milk to me - it has a warm, spicy, pleasant scent - but it definitely had that "warm milk before bedtime" effect. And it works miracles on my rambunctious two-year-old daughter. Not only does it produce LOADS of bubbles (fwiw we have an oversized clawfoot tub, and a third of a bar filled it to the top w/bubbles) but the scent seems to calm and relax her as much as me. Warning: don't take this bath if you're planning an evening out! You'll just want to snuggle into bed afterwards

Bubbles nicely but does not smell like "hot milk". I've never tried milky bar so I have no idea if the two compare. Hot Milk? IS comforting though. Its like being wrapped in warm fluffy towels straight from the dryer

I developed acne after I turned 23 and have had limited success using over the counter products. I purchased the acne kit and it began to clear up my skin, but I would still get the cysts that took for ever to go away or they would never get to the surface. I starting using the oxygen peel one a week and found that it wasn't doing much and that there was a lot of extra get that I had made that was wasted. I talked to the girl at the counter several days ago about this and I had a huge cyst that was very painful. She told my to use the oxygen peel 3 times in a row and that should help. I would be using all the extra gel that was made and would see more results. 
I went home that night and did just as she said. I was amazed to see that the painful cyst had risen to the surface and I was able to relieve the pressure. This is a truely amazing product and would recommend it to anyone who has this same proble

	For a touch of the sun without risking  skin damage the always innovative and practical  Laura Mercier came up with the "Solar Flair" Collection.

	One of my favorites in this line is the Illuminating Stick, an easy way to achieve an instant glow.  The stick is available in two shades, Golden Honey Glow, which provides a subtle bronze luster, and Golden Rose Glow, which very much resembles a natural blush.

	With earth minerals for a lovely luster and shine, the color is applied directly to the skin with fingertips or brush.  It blends smoothly and leaves a soft, velvety texture.

	There's no limit to where it can be used - as a blush on the apple of the cheeks or across forehead, brow bone or chin for a "just in from a day at the beach" look.  For evening my preference is the Honey Glow applied across shoulders as well.

	Key ingredients include Vitamin E, Vitamin C, Vitamin A, and Bismuth Oxychoride, which acts as a light reflector by sun or moonlight

Having shaved with everything from cheapo disposables to Thiers-Issard straight razors, I have to say that the Merkur Progress is probably the best all-around razor available today. It has excellent heft and balance, and the adjustment feature is simple and straightforward. (Although I do agree that the numbered adjustment seems to perform a little differently depending on the blade used.) It is easy to keep clean--assuming you don't mind unscrewing it and taking the blade out to wipe off the head and frame. Having also used a venerable old Gillette "fat boy" from the 1950s, I'd still have to rate the Progress as a better razor; the screw operated adjustment makes it constantly adjustable, not just in steps. 

Since this is a safety razor, its performance is significantly dependent on the blades used. I've tried both the Merkur blades and the Japanese "Feather" blades, and would say that it's a toss-up. 

And since it is an adjustable safety razor, it is perfectly suited to two-pass close shaving. A higher setting is excellent on the first pass with the grain of the beard, and a lower setting for the pass against the grain. The adjustment also allows you to adjust the razor to the conditions of your skin and beard. If you've let yourself get a day's worth of stubble (c'mon--don't we all?) you can set the blade high to mow that hedge. If you need a quick clean-up before a night on the town, you can set it lower for a "Once lightly, James."

So if you want a really well-made, no-nonsense but very versatile razor that will last for a good long time, this is a good bet. The only problem might be preventing pals from swiping it, or reminding your wife/significant other to take it apart to clean it after she smooths up those pretty pins you love so well.

One recommendation: Shop around. You can get these for under $40.00 if you bargain-hunt, likewise full 20-count boxes of carded Merkur 10-blade refill sets

I bought this on a whim because I just remodeled my house after Hurricane Katrina and now have a huge jacuzzi tub...nice to take long baths in so of course I needed some bubble stuff.  The bath bombs smell wonderful.  My whole bathroom smelled of the bath bombs until I used them all.  I even put the box they came in into my closet and it made my closet smell wonderful (for about a week)!  The bombs each have something special inside of them that you find out about when they dissolve.  The fizzing is fun and the smell lingered on my skin until the next day.  I loved them and will definitely buy more

This was my fisrt foray into lip scrubs.  I like the dual concept, with a scrub on one side and a lip balm on the other.  I also like the fact, this slips into you purse or pocket easily, so it's convenient for those on the go.  I took mine skiing in Vail, and it was the first time I didn't come home with chapped lips. 

The textures are good.  The scrub side is slightly grainy, more of a polish than a scrub.  I would not recommend it for heavily chapped lips, but it works well for weekly maintenance. The lip balm side is a little waxy, but moisturizing with vityamin e.  It's quite long-lasting and provides a sweet, natural shine.  This smells of spun vanilla, sweet and sugary. 

Why only 4 stars?  I think Tarte should have added SPF 15 sun protection.  Doing so would provide sweet, kissable lips and the protection you need

I got this as a present, when it finally came back in stock.

The scrub part of the stick does a great job, but you need to have lips that aren't in dire need of help for it to really work.  To do that, just use a moist, soft toothbrush, and gently scrub.  The scrub side will sometimes leave a little sugar behind, so you might have to wipe your lips off a little after you use it, but I found that this doesn't happen all the time.

The balm side goes on smoothly, and feels great.  It's silky feeling, but does not provide a lot of moisture, so, if you lips are on the dryer side,  this is not going to replace your regular gloss.

This stuff is great for on the go, and I will be buying it again when mine runs out

Forget all those other so-called good colognes out there. Happy for Men is the best smelling one of them all! It may be expensive, but it is well worth it. Example: I sprayed down a shirt with it and send it home with my girlfriend at her request! She requested this because she wanted have something of mine that she could sleep with it while we are apart. That is how good it is! Enjoy

I'm not kidding, it's worth every penny (though I must admit that I get it at a lower price from a secret supplier in Asia). After using this, you'll swear that you just got a hot oil/deep treatment done from a professional salon. 

I have chemically treated hair (relaxed, double process - colored & fine hair equals damaged hair), and this is the only conditioner that works for me. Another plus is, this is the only conditioner that elicits "your hair smells sooooo good" reaction from my boyfriend & daughter.

Surprisingly, even if it moisturizes my hair excellently, it still leaves it bouncy & with enough volume.

This lasts about 6 months if you use it once a week, so it's really not that expensive, especially if you substitute this for your regular deep conditioning treatment at the salon.

If you're still wary, try a smaller bottle

The Avobath bath bomb turns water a lovely luminous pale green. Avocado, olive oil, lemongrass, bergamot, rosewood oil, gardenia extract makes this a skin calming, soothing, moisturizing dream. The "green luster" makes this bath especially beautiful and gives it a mermaid mood. I loved this one so much, I'm ordering two the next time. 

The scent is lemon/lime, but by the time you get in the tub, the floral scents are more prominent. You can add in some bubbles, but they don't seem to last very long - well, I was using a bath gel. 

So, you may want to find a bubble bar because the olive oil seems to make them disappear pretty fast. At least, that is my theory because I've noticed bath oil does the same thing. Avobath goes well with Whoosh products or the Happy Hippy Shower gel. If you are in the mood, you might want the amazing "Godiva" shampoo and conditioner 2 in 1 bar (has a magical quality - makes hair super shiny) or the "I love Juicy" shampoo and "Veganese" conditioner. The last two also have a citrus scent and are especially delicious. 

When I use Lush products, I'm in a good mood all week long. It is truly amazing how happy and content I am as long as I have some Lush products around. :)

This cheery green bomb releases the uplifting scent of lemongrass blended with some other elements that make it well-rounded and fruity - the reviewer who likened it to Froot Loops cereal wasn't too far off base! Add a sizzling lemony-herbal top note to Froot Loops and you have this bomb's scent.

Since lemongrass oil is good for uplifting the spirits, this is a great bomb for those tired or grumpy days we all have sometimes.

There is the mildest shimmer to it, that you really have to look for in the water itself, and it gives the lime-green water a lovely depth and sparkle. But it isn't glittery and you won't end up with anything you can see on your skin. It is more an in-bath pony trick!

This is a great bomb for cheering you up on a wintry day, and one I keep a small supply of and use often

     As we've heard, it's not easy being green.  It's more than easy, it's delightful if you're an Avobath Bath Ballistic.  Infused with avocado (hence the name) and olive oil it moisturizes skin.

     The fragrance is fresh,  rather citrusy, thanks to lemongrass and rosewood.  Bath water is a lovely shade of green, rather like new spring grass.

      If there's glitter in it I didn't find any, which was as I wished.  It's suggested for morning - I'd relax with an Avobath any time of day

I love the fresh scent of the Avobath, there's just nothing like it. It smells like springtime to me. I have yet to notice any glitter in an Avobath bath (and I've taken about 10) so if you're glitter shy, don't let that stop you from trying this one

I like to eat avocados, I like avocado face masks, and now I can bathe in eau de avocado!  This bath bomb is possibly my favorite - very softening, great color (turns your tub into a nice green lagoon), and great lemony scent.  I didn't find the glitter to be very noticeable, so don't worry about that.  Stock up on this one

O.k,these glosses are just plain yummy!

Actually,they don't taste like lipglosses at all,which is a good thing.No one wants waxy or 
chemical flavored gloss that 
makes you want to throw up,right?

All the flavors are amazingly delicious.Each one tastes just like sweets.

The colors are sheer and radiant without looking cheap or tacky.

They go with any eyeshadow or blush color and make your lips sparkle.

I wish the  tubes were just a bit bigger and the glosses were less sticky.

Overall,nice glosses but a bit overpriced for such lil tubes

I am absolutely addicted to this lip gloss. I own over 300 different brands of gloss, and this is by far one of my favorites. It's a pretty good deal, at only $28 for so many colors. I like the small size because it easily fits into any evening bag or pocket. It's fun to layer the different colors as well, and there are an infinate amount of combonations between all of the different colors and flavors. They also taste amazing, each embodying a yummy taste exactly like sugar. It goes especially well with the Aquolina Pink Sugar fragrance, for a sugar-themed cosmetic experience

Was using philosophy's various light scents, discovered this Burberry London sample in my last Sephora shipment. Went to Macy's and bought the set for under $77-lotion, shower gel and 3.3 oz fragrance. Fretted over price until I actually used the products-layering them. Recieved SO many compliments! Not "an old lady's perfume"- not strong nor weak- it has an elegant floral fragrance. 
top notes: rose, clementine and honeysuckle.
heart notes: tiare flower, jasmine and peony.
dry down notes: sandalwood, veil of musk and patchouli. All my favorites

I've tried several shampoo bars and had finally given up hope that I could ever use them - they had always left my hair feeling gross and gummy - no matter how much I rinsed or tried vinegar/water mix rinses after (as was suggested).
But - this one had had some good reviews so I gave it a go. It was awesome! It lathered rather well, and rinsed out very easily. I used it in conjunction with the american cream conditioner - and my hair's very very silky and soft right now. (it had gotten very course over the period of a week with using avalon organics shampoo and conditioner)
I'm excited - now that I've finally found a shampoo bar that works, I can finally say goodbye to bulky shampoo bottles and same some space

Reincarnate can be a hard shampoo to get used to, especially if you're not already using LUSH products. It doesn't 'sud up' much, and feels a little bit muddy and grainy. Don't fret though! It will certainly clean your hair, and will also leave it smelling like wonderful spices (almost as good as "Arabian Bright"). The highlights are not something that come with one or two washings, but with many many washings, and they are /very/ subtle but there. The only reason I don't give this product five stars is that it was not as conditioning as it states it is, and I needed to use another conditioning product with it

I bought these with the also great socks and was completely pleased by the way they left my hands, hydrated and soft. After leaving them on for half an hour with the Glamour Gloves Gel my hands felt reborn. I couldn't get over how the moisturizers had penetrated. I've had these for a couple years and was almost sure they would stop working but they're still doing the job. I've recently seen less expensive gloves on the market and don't know how well they work but these are very high quality

I first caught a waft of this fragrance in a magazine as a tester. I fell in love with the sweet, sugary light smell of it and so did my husband. It's perfect for all seasons since it's light and it definitely makes people ask you what you're wearing. I've been told it smells everything from edible to kissably sweet. Now I want to try some of their other fragrances. If they are half as good as this, they win in my book

I have been using this product for about 3 months.  It is great!  Not only have I noticed a difference, but I get comments from people all the time about how refreshed I look.  I had a baby about 5 months ago and decided that I need to pamper myself a little.  I came across this product in January and was very cautious about purchasing another eye cream.  Nothing has worked in the past.  However, I decided to give it a try.  I noticed changes after a couple of weeks, but wasn't sure if it was just me wanting it to work or it actually working.  Well, now after 3 months, I can totally tell the difference.  I look so much better even without makeup.  I don't even need to put concealor under my eyes any more!!!  Plus, I receive so many great comments from people.

Thank you Hylexin.  Finally something that worked for me

This is the first bronzer I actually finished. This gives the most natural finish and blends really well. I like that it's matte because I'm not a fan of sparkly bronzer. Ever since I started using this, I'm just addicted and can't live without it. It gives the skin a really natural, healthy-looking flush.

I've got medium/olive skin and I use "Light". My skin doesn't look orangey or dirty. Try it and I'm sure you'll like it. Make sure you use a really good brush.

I love this fragrance!  It reminds me of some of the most beautiful and fragrant flowers of Hawaii.  If you've ever visited The Islands and smelled a pikake lei or walked past luscious jasmine bushes, and thought to yourself, "What is that heavenly smell?"  THIS IS IT!  There is not a scent out there on the market that evokes such memories and enjoyment as Kai.  My only concern about this fragrance line is the $cost$, but how I feel and think when I am wearing it makes it all worth it

While most sunscreens these days protect against sunburn, did you know that very few of them actually protect against photodamage? Only two sunscreen ingredients protect against the long UVAI rays that cause photodamage (brown spots, wrinkles, etc); zinc oxide and Parsol 1789. Zinc Oxide protects a broader range of these rays than does Parsol 1789. 

This Skinceuticals sunscreen has zinc oxide and it goes on without any white film or greasiness-perfect for daily use on the face. While Neutrogena Dry Touch suncreens feel more invisible on the skin (you can't even tell it is on except for the smell) and is a good alternative (has Parsol 1789), I still prefer the Skinceuticals for the added protection and virtually no scent whatsoever. Since it's expensive, I tend to use it just on the face and use a cheaper (like Neutrogena) sunscreen on the body when out in the sun.

This foundation provides a flawless finish and natural look, while also giving a good coverage.  I've been using this foundation for years, all year long, and it is one of my favorites.  Not too heavy and not too light, it's the perfect foundation.  

Being Asian American and with a light complexion, finding a good color match had always been a problem unless I spent $40 for a bottle of makeup.  Zhen is one of the best deals around - clean but stylish packaging with a superior product inside

This product is truly amazing!  The application method can be a bit tricky and the performance varies depending on the type of mascara you use, but if you follow the directions and find a good mascara formula then you WILL have long, long lashes.  My lashes are medium length, but when I use this people who know me thing I am wearing falsies.  This stuff rocks!  I've never been able to find a mascara that can do what this does

Is so true of this product.  I have to admit when I first saw the price tag of this product, it was half out of curiousity that I purchased.  I mean could a pair of $20 tweezers be THAT much better than the ole $1.75 or $3 pairs at home?  

Well if your asking yourself that question, YES!  These things have amazing grip and can pull the tinyiest of hairs.  Things that you would have to dig with normal tweezers until you finally rub your skin raw.

Without a doubt, you will get your moneys worth from this product as well as be amazed at their performance.  It's the type of "WOW" that makes you feel like, "How did I ever get along without these before".

Worth every penny and I'll never buy another cheap tweezer again.  These have lasted for years and still retain their fine point.

I had an Amazon reward certificate and was looking for something practical to use it on.  It so happened that I needed new tweezers.  I read the reviews and thought I'd give these a try.  Wow, I can't believe the difference in quality from any other tweezers I have ever owned.  They almost seem to adhere to whatever your are trying to grasp.  It is so easy to precisely and almost painlessly remove even the finest eyebrow hair.  Tweezerman Tweezers ROCK!

I'm sure that you don't need any more assurance, but just to let you know, I've had my tweezerman's for over 5 years now. They are still sharp! Plus if you ever were to drop them, they probably wouldn't be significantly damaged. These tweezers are a must have.

These are great for removing excess oil when you can't stop and wash your face or don't want to disturb your makeup.  I prefer this brand because they unfold to twice their size when you pull them out instead of the size of a half-dollar like the rest of them

I have been wearing Obsession by Calvin Klein since it was first launched in 1985, the year I first arrived in California. It seems I am one of those people forever stuck in a time warp and prefer this classic instead of trying new scents. While I prefer the eau de parfum spray I have both variations. Although at first this tends to have a strong aroma, this doesn't last after being applied to your skin. I love the blend of vanilla, mandarin orange, peach and lemon that make up the scent of Obsession.

My preference is more of a racy, provocative, alluring scent instead of brimming like flowers. With my skin irritations, asthma and allergies I have no problems with spraying my body parts with Obsession. The color is quite appealing, reminding me of Spiced Rum with the brown, amber and gold tones. Obsession cologne is suitable for both day and evening wear, indoors and outdoors and those luscious intimate settings. 

This is definitely a feminine scent, sweet, sexy and not too fruity or powerful.   There is a gold toned rim with the cap snapping on and pulling off most of the time with ease. Sometimes the lid does not go on just right and then the cap part becomes undone and this makes two pieces.

Once the scent has set in for awhile on my skin I detect a hint of floral with wood combination and have read on fragrance.net that Obsession has oriental spices. It really is a winning combination that has captured my interest over the years. This is a scent that is recognizable by men and women and can be worn through out the seasons. 

I would not say this is a musk scent but more of a spicy tingle that needs to be only administered once a day for long lasting appeal. The appeal of Obsession seems to run from girls in their early twenties to those of us in our early forties, from conservative ladies to party animals. 
 
Although it is a darker color than most fragrances, there is no staining on clothing, but I do not wear sweaters, whites or turtlenecks. When I do use the glass jar I have noticed frequently when standing over the sink the yellowish/brown tint left in the sink and have to rinse it off as well as my finger tips. 

Obsession is a potent and romantic perfume for evening. The prices of the assorted sizes of Obsession range from forty to sixty dollars.

This is by far the best Shampoo and Conditioner set I have used.  I have very fine, very straight, and very long hair that breaks easily but not with this shampoo and conditioner.  This set makes it smooth, but not oily and so when I brush my hair there is no yanking going on.  My hair is noticeably more shiny and soft.  It has a very pleasant scent and it is all natural.  What a great way to pamper yourself!  Definitely worth the extra investment

	Mistral, as many know, is a powerful, gusty wind that blows across the south of France.  Mistral, as I was happy to discover,  is also the name of a line of bath and body products, all French inspired, all lusciously lovely from scented soaps to soothing lotions to rejuvenating body butters.

	Matthew Tilker, founder and president of Mistral,  utilizes Shea butter, which is an efficacious natural healer, in a myriad of must-have forms.  Derived  from the nuts of the African Shea Tree (according to sacred custom the nuts are  harvested primarily by women), this butter  is  highly emollient,  a boon for those with dry skin, chapped lips, any number of skin irritations.

	The pure Shea Butter soap comes in a plethora of inviting fragrances, all milled six times (while others boast being  triple milled).  South Seas is a particular favorite - it's as fresh as an ocean breeze and as calming, soothing as a tropical island.  The marine scent is accented with a touch of grapefruit, white flowers and soft woods.  An irresistible combination.

	South Seas is a fragrance with which you wish to surround yourself - made possible by the shower gel, body lotion, massage bath and body oil, bath salts and candle all available at very accessible prices.

	Highly recommended

The cream is great. It instantly gets absorbed  after application and i believe helps over time close up leakage of blood capilleries (which causes black circle appearences). I suffered from chronic dark circles. This cream after 1 month of application has considerably lightened my dark circles and has reduced puffiness. I would suggest anyone who is looking for an effective cream give this product a shot. considering my condition i still have light dark circles left and hope this cream will continue to benefit me. I still have doubts on this cream totally brightening my skin tone around my eyes, but never the less I find it effective

Through luck of genetics, I have dark circles. I've had them since as far back as I can remember. No amount of sleep, eat well, or generally good lifestyle choices changed my dark circles. 

I was pretty hesitant to try it out, since, woah... $95 is a lot of money, but I gave it a shot. I used it exactly per the instructions.

I was actually pretty discouraged because I didn't see a change, but then BAM, in the 3rd week of using it, I woke up and my circles were soooo much noticably lighter. I could cry. It's hard being so young and having dark circles under your eyes, but now I  look more my age. And I'm still only in the 3rd week, so I have a lot of hope for the product. 

I feel badly for the people who didn't get a reaction, but as they state in their pamphlet, it will not work on 100% of people. Like anything, really, won't work for 100% of people. 

But it worked for me, and I'm so very happy. I would have paid sooo much more for these results.

I love how this product works and feels on my skin!! Does an excellent job off removing makeup and cleaning the skin with out drying your skin out! Makes skin feel cool and clean!!

I have very sensitive skin an was concerned that this product was going to break my skin out OR be very drying because this product tones as well as cleanses the skin. But that  wasn't the case. My skin didn't break out, nor is this product drying. Highly recommend!

I used this relaxer for the first time after using many brand name ones. I was impressed with the results. It leaft my hair with much needed moisture, and very shiny. I normally apply the realxer myself at home, but I choose to go professional to really capture the promises that this product states. The smell was not noticeable, which was good since most chemicals are so harsh and strong. It didn't burn my scalp like most have. The quantity was ample considering that most relaxers are cheap with the amount they give I think that it was worth the price! I'll be buying it again

This is by far the most expensive relaxer I've ever used and it is worth every penny.  I first heard of it as being Oprah's relaxer so I decided to hunt it down.  One of the best things I've ever done.  I have very coarse, thick "horsehair" that usually defeats most over the counter perms after a few washings.  Not Phytospecific's relaxer.  My hair stayed soft AND STRAIGHT no matter what the weather or I did to it. And it's the healthiest it's ever been.  No other relaxer ever did that for my hair.  In fact they usually made it worse! I absolutely love the Phytorelaxer and I am officially addicted.  If it were less pricey, it would get 5 stars

i'm black, have kinky hair, and i've been relaxing my hair for about 25 years. i've used many many types of relaxers to my dismay:- hair falling out, breaking, dry, etc.
so i let my hair "rest" for about 5 years then i tried the relaxer thing again after i found phyto. i've been doing my own hair now for about 1 year, and it's been great!- except for the price. my hair still feels as if it has life in it, it it is not breaking, it is not falling out. it burns like regular straightener. i use vinegar to neutralize it, then use the neutralizing shampoo with indicator to check for pink. please, there's not enough neutralizing shampoo to get rid of the staraightener.
the price is scary, but i'm more afraid of having my hair fall out and having to fix that. 
soon, i'll have to get a hairdresser though, because my hair has now been retaining it's length and growing - and it's harder to straighten it myself.

I'm a big fan of "non-traditional" perfumes - I don't care for sweet floraly scents, and I have been known to poach my man's cologne occassionally, just to enjoy the scent all day. So if you like citrusy/woodsy scents, you MUST try this one - it has an unusual top note and dry-down that are hard to describe, but anyway it never fails to get compliments from men, and the "WHAT are you wearing?" from women.  

It's intense, but it's not overpowering the way some Orientals can be.  But it's also summery-light.  I can't explain it - just try it.  A couple of times.  And for something even more unusual, try Jardin Mediterrenne (sp?) also by Hermes - the only perfume I've ever given 5 stars

I *love* this formula for my thick, naturally curly, slightly hilighted hair.  It does a great job cleaning without stripping, and this is the first conditioner that did a good job tackling my naturally curly hair without weighing it down.  I did get a good deal at my salon - $9 for the shampoo and a little more for the conditioner

To tell you the truth, I have tried everything on my hair to take away the frizz.  Nothing really worked at all...but Biosilk is a miracle!  The first time  I tried it, I noticed a major difference in my hair.  Just add a little bit to your hair, and it will immediately smooth it out, adding shine and softness.  It will also not weigh your hair down or make it too greasy..just don't use that much of it.  I mostly use this with my flat-iron, and I get amazing results.  I happen to like the smell of it...it reminds me of being in a salon!  Try the shampoo and conditioner as well

I have wavy and coarse hair and I have a whole lot of it. I use this product after shower on damp hair and then blow-dry. This product really works and makes my hair soft and silky and it gives the hair nice movement and makes it easy to style. My hairdresser who has similiar hair as mine recommended me this product and she said she loves it. I am very happy to find this product before wasting a lot of money on trying others that don't work. It is a bliss

My hair stylist first introduced me to this product a few years ago and I've used it ever since. It makes your hair really soft and shiny and even smells good. Just a little of biosilk goes a long way. Gets rid of the frizz and dryness and really improves the look and feel of your hair. I definitely reccomend it

I was hooked on Sebastian's shine serum forever.  Then I switched to this after hearing all the rave reviews.  It makes it just as shiny as the Sebastian, but for my thick wavy hair, it is easier to apply.  I only need about a quarter size amount, way less than any other product.  It has a nice soft finish.  
So if you like Sebastian and Redkin's shine serums, you'll like this.  
I'm not going to go as far as to say it's a miracle worker.  It makes your hair shinier.  It helps a little with my frizz, but doesn't depouf.

I have straight hair, but it is super-long and thick, past my waist, so I have problems combing it and keeping it smooth.  Biosilk is the best stuff I have found to detangle after washing, and keep my hair soft after it is dry.  I have tried everything else, and I mean everything, and nothing compares.  I'm so hooked I have bought it by the gallon, and believe me, that is not cheap!  It even smells great, it's not greasy, and it is fantastic for giving or receiving massages, too

This is truly one of the best hand and nail creams out there.  It is quickly absorbed and not at all greasy - I put some on before I walk out the door in the morning and again before bedtime and it has made a real difference in the softness of my hands and the health of my cuticles.  Hangnails have always been a problem for me but this product keeps them under control as long as I apply it regularly. Love it!

I really like this mascara. I only gave it 4 because it is clumpy and I have to spend a little time with my eyelash comb getting the clumps out.  Otherwise, it is the only mascara that doesn't cause me to loose a ton of lashes.  Everything else from Estee Lauder, Bourjois to Great Lash causes me loose a lot of lashes.  I also like that if I cry, I don't wind up looking like a raccoon, it subtly melts away; no mess! It washes off easily with soap and water and is flexible, not flaky.

I have been using mascara since I was a teenager and this is absolutely the best ever. Ocassionally I have read reviews about other 'fantastic' mascaras and strayed and tried them, only to be disappointed. Now I wouldn't even bother trying anything else even when given in free gift packs. I have very long fair eyelashes and use black. The brush is easy to guide and you do not end up with big thick, clumpy patches especially when the mascara is new. It parts and separates the lashes perfectly. For night I apply 2 coats for a more dramatic look. It never smudges and is easy to remove (I use Clinique 'naturally gentle eye make-up remover'). And yes, it may be a little expensive but it lasts for ages (doesn't dry out like other mascaras)and the quality of the product surpasses anything else. Also my eyes tend to be a little sensitive and I have never had any problems even when accidentally getting the mascara in my eye. Try it, you won't be disappointed

Follow the cleanser with the Komenuka Bijin Skin Lotion and you may wonder why you are suddenly catching the scent of SAKE. In fact, this cleansing toner does contain SAKE along with Rice Bran, Seaweed, Aloe, Yeast, Glycyrrhizate, Orange, Lemon, Matricaria, Algae, Luffa Cylindrica and Fountain Water.

The toner completes the process of removing impurities and also has the added benefit of contracting the pores so they look smaller. Men may also enjoy this as an aftershave lotion.

It's amazing how much you can smear on, leave on with the socks for at least half an hour and have all those great softening agents completely absorbed when you take off the socks. It leaves feet renewed. Use it once or twice a week to tame tough tootsies

I received this razor as a birthday gift from my brother a couple of weeks ago. I thought, "Hmmm...Handsome looking vintage piece, but there's no way in hell I'm gonna put that meat cleaver to my face!" Well guilt got the best of me, I figured the razor looked expensive so I'll give it a go and hope that if I die from blood loss the police will figure out that my death was from shaving with a new razor and it's not from suicide. I'll tell you after a few times shaving with this razor I am now going to retire My Gillette Fuzion. It's takes a bit longer to shave with this razor than with a conventional multi-blade but the results are undeniably better. My wife can't wait to kiss my cheek with school girl glee right after I shave! I have a beard that is as tough as sandpaper and I've never had a closer shave than with this Merkur. I don't have the same spots to go over and over again and therefore my face is less irritated. I use a brush, a glycerin based shave cream and always shave in the shower and that makes a significant difference as well. Factor in that blades for this razor costs so much less then Mach 3 & Fuzion's (I buy cryogenically tempered blades that last 2x longer than store bought) and the way to opt out from expensive razor marketing ploys becomes clear. Don't sit on the fence on this one ditch whatever Mach, to the nth power, razor you're using and pick this Merkur ASAP

This razor rocks... the proper technique is easy to learn: short, light strokes, down, then up (if you want a closer shave). This gives me hardly any nicks compared to the Gillette Mach 3 and is way easier to unclog than the Shick Quattro. 

The sample blade continues to last with about 2 shaves a week since Dec. 2006. Typical razor cartridges wouldn't even come close to that longevity, and they cost about 4 times as much as the replacement Merkur blades, which are 50 cents each.

I am just doing facial shaving with it at this point; hopefully it will fare just as well with head shaving. I expect I'll be using Merkur for the rest of my life

My very first DE razor after many recommendations, and I must say that I am yet another one of those enthusiastic supporters of the Merkur HD DE Safety Razor.  I may eventually decide to upgrade, but if I ever do, it will only be after much practice with this razor and simply for the sake of having the adjustment feature, which may or may not be necessary for some individuals depending on the toughness and thickness of your beard.  When used in conjunction with a badger hair shaving brush, some excellent shaving cream (Proraso was my first, and the only thing mildly unpleasant is the scent, and even that grows on you after a while...check your local Target near the women's spa section) and the highest quality DE razor blade, changed every so often, of course, this razor provides an excellent, close, irritation-free shave.  After using this marvel, I vow never to return to the cheaply made, ridiculously expensive (when the cost of replacement cartridges is considered over the course of a man's shaving lifetime) multi-blade systems of Gillette or Schick.  Just be a little more careful of your technique, and getting an outstanding shave from this razor should be a cinch.  Highly recommended

I'm a first time DE shaver and this razor is great.  My grandfather used these types of razors, and it feels wonderful to be able to enjoy shaving rather than scraping my face with a Mach III.

Only advice is, try a couple different blades.  Depending on your skin type/beard you'll need a different type of blade.  One blade doesn't fit all.   And always remember, this isn't the Mach III, don't apply pressure

I have very fine, poker straight hair that is not dry or oily.  Then I got this conditioner and BIG shampoo and my hair regained it's shine, but more importantly -- I got bounce!  I never had any waves or body in my hair before but this conditioner did it.

I have used the BIG shampoo with other conditioners and it was not as good for me.  I like Big shampoo, but this VEGANESE conditioner is the real key to my newly bouncy hair.  VEGANESE just works perfectly for me and my hair has never looked better.

One thing -- I kind of hate the smell and I do not think it is lemony at all.  It smells...I don't know, too much like an "granola girl" or something -- almost patchouli-like to me.  HOWEVER it leaves my hair looking super, so really, who cares if it smells good in the shower

This conditioner leaves hair ultra-soft and doesn't weigh it down. If you have trouble with conditioners leaving a strong residue on your hair, this one won't.

The ingredients contain rosemary infusion, lavender flower infusion, seaweed and fresh lemon juice. The lemon is great for washing the hair clean of residue. It's a great conditioner

If your hair alternates between various moods every day of the week, then a good supply of conditioners and shampoos should keep you happy all year long. The lemon oil in two of the Lush products work together especially well. Veganese Conditioner and I Love Juicy shampoo could not be a better solution if you need to deep clean your hair. Like after you have put too much hairspray in your hair or you went swimming or say you fell in a mud puddle (In that case, also reach for Happy Hippy body wash). 

You just never know what may occur and one must always be prepared. The Veganese is also a lovely vegetarian product that can be enjoyed by anyone. It has a very clean, happy energy and a lemony scent. The slippery conditioner slicks across your hair, making it shiny and manageable without weighing it down.

This also contains rosemary infusion, lavender flower infusion, seaweed and fresh lemon juice. Will be appreciated by anyone trying to lighten their hair. 

If you use the henna products by Lush, these two products might slightly lighten your henna results. This could be desired or you may want to go back to using Rehab and American Cream if you want to keep a deeper henna shade.

If you want to feel light and breezy, this conditioner won't weigh you down. My hair feels fluffy and deliciously light and bouncy. I have this strange urge to go wander in lemon orchards, run through mud puddles and pick flowers by the side of the road. 

Now officially in the mood to make lemonade!

I used Veganese for quite awhile, quite happily.  As there is no artificial fragrance, or strong natural fragrance oils in the product, it has a ho-hum scent.  This actaully was a nice break from all the overwhelmingly perfumed hair products on the market.  I felt Veganese adequately conditioned my hair, did not irritate my scalp.  I liked that it had no animal products and is not tested on animals.  Those who try to avoid chemicals may not like sodium lauryl sulfate in this product

You use the peel kit by mixing a clear gel capsule with water and smear that onto your face.You then  put some cream on top of the gel on your face which mixes together creating a shaving cream beard. After using the creams you then scrape it off using a tongue depressor look alike to shave off the foam. After a quick rinse my skin looked less dull,  and helped clear  blotches.4 stars because I ran out of the cream, and still have some unused gel capsules

I really like this peel.  It is very easy to use and I have noticed a difference in my skin.  It is clearer and the redness and discoloration is fading.  I even noticed my clogged pores are diminishing.  I recommend this peel to anyone.  I have very sensitive skin and it did not cause irritation.  I use this one about twice a week.

I also recommend the microdelivery vitamin C peel.  That one I use once a week.

Calling this a peel doesnt seem quite right. When I think of the word peel I imagine the old gel type peels that you would let dry on your face and then take off like a mask. Or I think of something that is harsh or abrasive. While this works like a peel it is gentle and goes far beyond what you would expect a facial product to do.

You need this product if you
- your skin is prone to break out and is very congested  
- your skin is sun damaged  
- your skin is aging rapidly  
- you enjoy in-office medical peels 
- you have a big event coming up and want your skin to look great  
- you want to maximize penetration of your treatment products 
- you want baby soft skin 


Also if you smoke! I first tried this years ago when I was a smoker and it made such a difference in the texture and clarity of my skin. 

This is a truly amazing product and completely different and unique to anything else on the market. Try it and you'll see.

This product also lasts a surprisingly long time. You only use half a capsule for each treatment which gives you several months of usage out of it

I wanted to try a new lipgloss because all of the colored ones that I have are horrificly sticky and if they aren't sticky they do not stay on for long.  This one however, manages to combine my love for lipgloss with all the needs of a chapstick.  The color (apple a day) was intimidating looking in the tube but looks perfectly on and doesn't go anywhere.  It also has NO STICKYNESS!  YAY!  I love this gloss and is the perfect gloss for all of my needs!

without being obnoxious. I genuinely feel like a woman of

Caleche is an absolute classic.  I'm often stopped and asked what I'm wearing.  Pretty much everything at the department stores smells the same (LIKE CHEMICALS).  Caleche is the real thing and the Soie de Parfum lasts. Make sure when purchasing that you don't accidentally buy Caleche Eau Delicate...it's a completely different frangrance, guaranteed to make you gag.  Why do marketers keep coming up with subtle twists to existing fragrances (Miracle, Happy, Pleasures, Poison)?  Once you try Caleche, you'll no longer look for anything else; I highly recommend the lotion and shower gel, too

lipstick going. This review is for the Guava Stain shade. I first bought this lipstick, I believe in the mid to late eighties. I was delighted with it then and am now. It is sheer, light, non greasy and the color never changes. The color is NOT neutral, but I find that I can wear it with almost any color of clothing except primarily pink or red outfits. Over the years it has become just about the only lipstick shade I wear. I would buy different brands,different shades and wear them maybe once then back to Guava Stain. It along with Clinque's soft pressed blush in New Clover, orginally bought about the same time as the lipstick have become my favorites, and the one's I reach for time and again. They are my dependables. Daytime wear for sure, not night, this is a subtle sheer color

i love get fresh products, especially the lemongrass lavendar scent. i use the hand sugar scrub (which is very moisturizing and gets rid of cooking odors on hands). it is very light and pleasant, as are the others. i love the look better naked kit and the relief for tattered tootsies kit. i am a beauty junkie and i have used much more expensive products but i never seem to like them as much as these. great gift- the hatbox design is very cute

I have always carried a soft spot in my hear for shiny metallic eye shadows and metallic browns, chocolates, coppers and vanilla such as in this quad for look fantastic on pretty much any complexion. Each prismatic color cube is in it's own tiny little clear box with a tiny lid on, those I discard and simply keep the top four squares open unless I out the entire top lid on once I'm done doing my makeup.

I love to sweep the palest shimmery vanilla on the entire brow bone and my whole lid, I usually wear black liquid liner right under the lash line and right on top, creating a black back drop that make applying any eye makeup on top easy and gives it great depth. Then I use the darkest color with a short brush I cut on an angle to blend the dark color on top of the liner for a smoky and glowing effect. The other two colors I layer on top in between the vanilla base and the dark smoke, but I don't feel the need to use all four colors at the same time. I also wet the brush sometimes, Visine is good for making liquid liner type of a finish when used on a brush and then dipped in some shadow.

The colors have deep intensity to them and they sparkle like melting precious metals in the sun. Wonderful for any makeup novice or artist for their ease of use and the dramatic and breath taking effect they so easily produce.

I've never smelled anything like this.  If you've ever been to the Mediterranean coast, you will be instantly transported by this scent.  It goes on strong, lasts long, and dries down to a wonderfully woodsy-citrusy finish that definitely has a bit of ocean air - but not the "Yankee Candle Ocean Water" type scent... this is the real thing, like an aromatherapy treatment you can take with you!  Rejoice, all women who are tired of sugary-syrupy womens' perfume!  This is it

This fragrance takes you on holiday to a place you may never have been.  It is a warm environment, smelling of salt water and warm skin. There is a tang in the air of citrus, maybe grapefruit.  This blend is absolutely delicious, inspring a hunger for more. I simply can't get enough of Un Jardin en Mediterranee. 

The Eau de Toilette is very light and subtle.  Fresh but not girly. Tangy, not sweet. This fragrance is for women who understand the allure of salt and warm skin. 


I purchased this fragrance 3 weeks ago and have worn nothing else since; it will remain one of the four or five fragrances I wear.  I look forward to when the line expands to include body cremes or lotions, or bath products

An awesome product that sells out - and that's the only problem!  I had to call around the US to find it in a department store, in stock and that would ship.  Amazon's supplier was sold out.

Proraso Shave Cream is the best bang for the buck in hi-end, non drugstore shave creams.  I've tried them all and keep coming back to proraso.  The texture, consistency and effectiveness of the cream are first rate - and you don't need a badger hair brush! I initially missed using a brush at first, but don't miss all the product I wasted that were left behind in the bristles.  Couple proraso with a good safety razor (may I suggest Merkur) and you'll get a shave that trounces anything a Mach III can throw at you. Trust me

I typically don't wear much cologne or perfume but this one is a winner! My husband bought this one for me for Christmas, I'd never even seen it before but he liked how it smelled.  What a great guy! I couldn't have been happier with this gift. I love this scent...clean and fresh...you can wear this scent day or night, not heavy or overwhelming.  The unique beauty of the bottle is wonderful too.  Highly recommend Beyond Paradise

I bought the Laura Mercier Kit: Mini Glaces with six glaces including: champagne glace, rose glace, bare beige glace, ambre rose glace, petal glace and violet glace. 

My favorite was Rose, but all of the colors are very beautiful. I also have a full size of Melon, another of my favorites. While the colors are beautiful, provide lots of shine and are long wearing, they are very sticky. MAC Lip Glass is much stickier, so if you don't mind that, they might be right for you. Also, the good thing about the kit is that you get to try lots of different colors, but the tubes are quite small, with a steep price. So, if you are willing to put up with a sticky gloss and a high price tag in exchange for some of the most beautiful colors, this might be the right gloss for you.

        Lips need a little shimmer in the summer, which is why I'm a fan of  Laura Mercier's Lip Glaces.  While they do come in 14 luscious shades, my two current faves are "Cancun Coral" and "Miami Pink."  The "Cancun Coral" is a soft coral which I like for day wear, and the "Miami Pink" has all the sparkle and pizzazz of hot pink - perfect for evening (especially with Mercier's Pressed Powder Bronzer).

	All the shades are abundantly blessed with Vitamin E, Lanolin and Mineral Oil to soften and smooth lips.  These glaces aren't at all heavy or sticky - they're light, go on easily, evenly, and don't bleed over lip lines if you take a bite of something good.

	Glaces can be worn alone or over lip color if you want to give added gleam to a favorite lipstick

All right for starters, i always have thought curve to be a very cheep crappy cologne. But i had never smelled it, i had always hurd it from friends and family that it sucked. Well the other day i was at work and some girl that has always liked me gave me two samples of curve. I tried them out and loved the origanal curve the smell is sweet but still masculine, girls love it, all the time girls say, you smell really good and ask what i'm wereing, and i always say " that smell is all me baby" But really i have curve to thank for all the action i've been getting, you have to try it out for your self.     I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I've generally been a one-cologne guy -- I had settled into using Acqua di Gio for a number of years, after having used Nautica for a number of years as well. When she got pregnant several months ago, my wife confessed to me that she really didn't like Acqua di Gio (this after two years! Pregnancy does heighten sensitivity to smell, though). 

I still had some Nautica around, plus the original and no-longer-made Zegna scent from Spain, so I used those for a while. I then bought the newest Zegna cologne, "Z", after my wife smelled it and found it unobjectionable.  

Well, no sooner had I bought the Z then my wife found a scratch and sniff of Curve in some magazine and said that I really should be using that. The next day we happened to be at K-Mart -- K-MART!!! -- for some household odds and ends, and my wife came across a display of Curve. She insisted on buying it for me. 

Ever since then, my wife goes nuts when I use it. I don't use it during the week, really -- I'm a somewhat older guy, and it has a sweetish overtone to it that's not very serious -- but whenever I do, my wife always tells me how absolutely wonderful I smell, indeed, how DELICIOUS I smell. Today was casual Friday at work, so I figured, okay. I leave for work very early, before my wife is awake. Sure enough, she calls me at work this morning -- "you used Curve today, didn't you? I can tell because the bathroom smells wonderful!"

Every woman I know who has commented on it loves it on guys. So it's less expensive and available at K-Mart. And yes it is a little bit sweeter than most colognes I'm personally used to. But it does have a pleasant smell, and if the women love it, well . . .

I have an oily T-zone, or I should say "had".  I started using this product because I was breaking out a lot due to the extra oil my skin was producing to keep my face moisturized.  Not only has my face cleared up, but it has a nice healthy shine to it all day.  No makeup necessary.

It is definitely a great moisturizer.  If you're looking for something that is thick but NOT greasy and won't make you look like you're frying an egg on your forehead, this is definitely it!  The texture also makes it easy to apply makeup on afterwards.  I use it everyday in the morning time after I wash my face.  The only thing to be careful is, if you have EXTREMELY dry and parched skin and are exfoliating daily to the point where your skin is aching, then try to stay away from this moisturizer until your skin heals.  I was overdosing my skin with benzoyl peroxide, AHA acids, and retinol a few months ago, leaving my skin extremely sensitive.  When I put on this gel, it would make my skin burn.  But other than that, you're safe using it on a daily regular normal routine

I have been using this starter kit for almost a month and I am beginning to see results. My experience with this product has been that my skin definitely got worse before it got better. For the first few weeks, my skin seemed to explode with more acne than usual... however, last week it started to clear up rapidly. I'm still having blemishes pop up daily, but they disappear within a few days, and overall my skin is much smoother and my (many, many) scars are less visible. I have struggled with moderate to severe acne for 6 years and have tried more products and treatments than I care to remember, and decided to try Murad after it was suggested to me (I'd never heard of it before). It certainly is no "miracle" product where you see results instantly (especially if you have a moderate to severe acne problem), but I just re-ordered the starter kit and am hoping the results will continue to improve. This product is definitely worth a shot

Murad promises the miracle cure for acne. While the product is good, it's not a miracle. I've been usines Murad for two months and while my skin has improved, it's not flawless. I still get break outs and they still take a while to heal. I'll keep using it because it's a skin routine as good as any other and who knows, maybe my skin will improve

This is my favorite soap in the world.  A new bar will scent my bathroom for weeks, and the scent lingers on my skin as well.  The soap is gentle and long-lasting. I recommend it highly

I'm an admitted soap snob so I've probably tried just about every soap there is. Mistral soap is right up there with the best.
First of all I have to mention the customer service. I had bought another brand of soap that came in a very pleasing scent combo that Mistral didn't offer. I emailed Mistral's customer service asking them to consider making it. I got a reply right away and after a few email exchanges was told they would see what could be done. I like that--being responsive to the customer.
 What do I like about the soap? For one thing, the size. It's huge at 7 oz. I also like the scents offered: Very pleasing combinations that stay on the skin in a subtle way once you rinse and dry. Best of all is how it lathers up on the skin and once rinsed off leaves no residue. It does leave the skin soft.

Naturally, with a name like Buffy, I would have tried this.  Whether I like it or not I get these on a regular basis from friends and family who see my name splattered all over it.  Lucky for me, I like.  

Ever heard the expression 'soft as a baby's butt'?  Erm, no? 

Easy.  Simple to use, obviously.  No messing with jars or bottles.  Just go to town massaging those pesky areas - I'm convinced it works wonders on orange peel skin, and cannot be persuaded otherwise.

I have some dry bumpy bits at the top of my arms that have been resistant to any scrubby product I've ever tried to use, but buffy got my skin so smooth! Amazing, and highly recommended. Soak in the tub/shower/whatever so the hot water softens up your skin, then scrub away. The small bar lasts 2 or 3 uses; the large is twice as big. The small one is more reasonably priced for people who just want to sample the stuff.

This thing has lots of great little scrubby bits in it. Ground rice, ground almonds, AND adzuku beans. Not just one, but three, and they are all super-scrubby. You'll be a little red when you're done, but it's SO worth it once you've cooled off and your skin is as smooth as a baby's bottom.

The only downside is that it makes your tub look like somebody dumped sand into the bottom of it once the thing drains. The bar melts at around 'hot water' temperature, and you're not supposed to use any moisturizer after using this stuff - but you really don't have to! The moisturizing oils in the bar really do work very well. I'll definitely be picking up a couple more of these.

The cocoa butter/lemon/lavendar scent is really amazing as well. Soothing AND refreshing, it can wake you up in the morning or calm you down at night before you go to sleep. Definitely try this thing, though, if you're looking for ultimate exfoliation plus moisturizing

I am 40 and fell in love with this scent right away.  The nice thing is you don't need to douse yourself with it to get the effect.  My mother,who is 75, never mentions my perfume, noticed it right away and kept asking me about it.  I just ordered her some for her birthday

I am in my mid 30's.  I am not a Britney fan at all.  I received a department store sales flyer in the mail a few days ago and it had a sample of Fantasy in it.  Out of curiosity, I opened it and could not believe I liked the scent.  My husband and I are both picky about perfume.  I decided to order a sample size off of Ebay before buying the full monty - because the last perfume we both really liked was Sensi - but it made my husband sick after a bit.  Well, I got it yesterday and I still really like it.  I am shocked the sweetness that it starts with does not give me a headache.  I think I will buy a full sized bottle once my sample is gone

I just got this perfume for Valentine's Day.  I love it!  Yes, it is sweet smelling, as another reviewer mentions, but it's a pleasant sweetness.  Cotton candy does describe it, actually.  But who says grownups don't like smelling yummy??  There's a hint of vanilla as well and overall, I think the combo is fantastic!

I love Curious, and now I love Fantasy, too!  They are two very different perfumes, so it's easy to understand why a person can like one and not the other.  I will say, though, that Fantasy lasts far longer than Curious.  You can apply it in the morning and still smell it when you go to sleep!  Which, I don't mind at all...

I recommend this, of course, but I recommend you sample it before you buy.  Just because you liked Curious doesn't mean you will like this one

This is a minty fresh soap that keeps its fragrance by being topped with a black wax layer (hence Demon in the Dark.) Before you put this in the shower, cut off the wax. Then enjoy the tingling soap. Very invigorating

I have been struggling with dry skin and mild acne for years. Recently, I revamped my cleansing routine and my makeup. I bought the Philosphy Purity cleanser and Hope in a Jar. It has made an unbelievable difference in my skin! My skin is smooth, not a dry flake anywhere. It is as soft as a baby's butt.

It is worth noting that a little goes a LONG way. You only need a very small amount (about the size of a dime or less) for your whole face. It is a very light texture, almost like a mousse, and glides over your skin and absorbs quickly. If you use too much (I did the first few times)then your face could look greasy. If you remember that less is more, then you will get a perfectly moisturized, yet matte, complexion.

After using the Philosophy cleanser and Hope in a Jar, I use the Bare Escentuals mineral makeup (bought the Light/Fairly Light starter kit). My skin, for the first time ever, is flawless. No acne. No dry skin. No reddish areas. Just a perfectly smooth complexion. I keep looking in the mirror, thinking "Is this my skin? Really?" I cannot believe what a difference this product (and the mineral makeup) has made. 

I have heard of others being allergic to some ingredients in the Hope in a Jar, so it is not for everyone. I suggest getting a sample size to make sure you won't have a reaction

First of all let me preface this by stating that I literally just put this product on minutes ago. I have had a chemical peel over a week ago and was given Retin A and therefore my face was peeling so horribly, that I thought I couldn't leave the house. I mean my makeup would literally come right off. I was horrified! I tried several moisterizers sometimes multiple ones but could still see the skin flaking off onto my desk, so I researched this and went to Sephora and bought a kit. I washed my face, did the serum and added this product and I honestly do not see 1 single flake of dry skin, it does tingle but I think it's because my face is raw and so dry but it feels as if my skin is drinking it up like a cold glass of water. I am anxious to see what happens in the weeks to come. I have mild cyctic acne and have struggled with it for years. I decided to see a dermatolist and then got chemical peels it helped to rid me of the bad acne but then I was so dry for 2 wks I couldn't bare to even look at myself. My skin doesn't hurt anymore, for allthe sensitive people, there is a sensitve version but if you have dry skin from the crazy acne treatments they make us do or peels or just dry winter heat, this is the product for you. If it seems strong then use it every other night until you skin can adapt. Or just once a day. I hope you find this product helpful like I did becaus I am still looking in the mirrow that's at my desk

Fahrenheit by Dior has a fragrance like no other... I've been fascinated by this fragrance ever since I can remember.

It is bold and fragrant... generally people seem to either like it a lot or hate it. It seems a little overpowering at first but as I said, you either like it or hate it.

the fragrance is masculine no doubt and it's not something that I'd use in summer... essentially a night fragrance.

Lancome's Juicy Tubes in Simmer tastes like my beverage of choice, Orange Julius.  When you apply it, it feels like you're rubbing the tip of an orange creamsicle ice cream pop onto your lips (minus the cold, minus the cream).  The color is a very subtle pink-ish beige, but it provides enough glossy shimmer to keep your lips a-simmer!  This is my 4th tube of juicy (also a big fan of Spring Fling & Berry Bold) and so far this is my favorite flavor

I used to use Mac's Glass lipgloss before Juicy Tubes were around. Any time the wind blew I had hair stuck to the incredibly sticky gloss which, as you know, is extremely unpleasant and annoying. Juicy tubes stays on, but doesn't have the overly-sticky feeling which is wonderful.

I don't wear much makeup and find Juicy Tubes to add that "something special" to a dewy face. I recommend Daiquiri or Berry Bold for the most natural looks. Daiquiri is more of a straightforward shine while Berry Bold gives you that red lipped childlike look we all used to have naturally. You will adore this gloss. I can't live without it

Oh my gosh!  I love this lip gloss so much.  I first bought one last year, and it was the best item of makeup I've ever bought!  It goes great over other lip gloss/lipstick or alone.  All of the colors are great, but I'd start our with pink first.  My personal favorite is "Spring Fling" because it's not so bright, but it's still juicy.  You will deffinetly not regret buying one of these.  It's worth every penny

My boyfriend has this cologne and I love it!  It smells so good.  Even if he is wearing the deodorant and not the cologne, it smells as if he was.  It may be a little on the expensive side (not as expensive on amazon.com as Macy's or other department stores), but it's well worth it.

If there is a better shaving cream out there, I couldn't find it. I've not had any problems and a year later, I'm still on my first purchase with about 40% left. 

Fantastic stuff

I love this stuff!! Five months ago I was diagnosed with having AK's (Actinic Keratosis -- lesions that can develop into squamous cell carcinoma/ skin cancer). My dermatologist recommended I use Skinceuticals CE Ferulic every day as it prevents thymine dimers (DNA mutations associated with skin cancer) with a medium exfoliator for a few months before taking more drastic measures to eradicate the AK's. My skin has never been healthier!! The lesions (which were scaly, itchy, and red) are healed and the overall apperance of my skin has improved dramatically and is much more even. My pores are smaller and I have a healthy glow. The CE Ferulic also is packed with antioxidant protection to help fight free-radical damage and provides photoprotection. 
HIGHLY recommended for those with AK's, uneven skin tone, large pores, or blemished or dull skin. 
LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!

After hearing so many good things about Philosophy's Cinnamon Buns, I just had to try it out for myself. I found it to not really smell like cinnamon buns, but more like water mixed with sugar. If you use it on your head, it will leave a lingering smell, but it won't last long on your body after taking a shower. I think this product is a nice way of treating yourself, but I definitely do not think it smells like cinnamon buns, which left me slightly disappointed. Overall, a great product

I am a huge fan of the creme, but not of this lip balm. For the price they want this should've been much, much better. It goes on nice and has a neutral taste and moisturizes ok. My L'Occitane Lip balm or just plain shea butter does a much better job moisturizing my lips than this does.  Save your money and do not buy this.

I have been searching for years for something to keep my lips from chapping, and this is it.  It's absolutely amazing, better than anything I have tried, and I have tried so many lip products.  The lemon custard flavor is delicious, too.  Put it on at night and in the morning your lips will be soft and smooth--This is the ultimate conditioner for your lips.

I first got a whiff of Blue in a magazine advertisement, when it came out and, it was love from that moment. I went out and purchased it and, this is all I wear now. It is all I want to wear. Nothing else compares to this, for me. I get so many compliments! I had one coworker once, who would walk by me just so he could smell it. He told me what he was doing, of course, he just loved the smell. People want to know what I am wearing and where they can purchase it. I feel great when I'm wearing it and, I will keep using it as long as they will make it

This fragrance took me quite by surprise when I first tried it from a magazine sample, so much so that I knew I had to try it at a department store - this was a little over a year ago. Then I sampled it at a department store and all my nose could think was "Wow!" - gardenias from my grandmother's garden, the suntan oils & tropical perfumes that I smelled as a little girl at the beach, with a few more florals blended in that make this fragrance even more exotic and sensual - I knew I had to have it! I bought myself a bathgel and lotion set and put the large bottle of cologne on my X-mas list, which my sweet & generous boyfriend got for me. 
In my opinion, this is probably the most alluring fragrance for women that I have ever smelled. I feel very alluring every time I wear it for my boyfriend - and he loves it! So this would be a great gift for a man's wife or girlfriend, or for a woman's best friend, sister or cousin (as long as you wear it for your own man, too!), but a slightly awkward gift to give to your mother, aunt or grandmother - it's that enticing. But if your single older relative or friend simply must have it as one of her gifts, then have it given by one of her female friends, sister, cousin or "Santa". That way there won't be any awkwardness at gift-giving time. Believe me - this fragrance is the olfactory equivalent of French lingerie or a string bikini!

I absolutly love ALL of Carol's daughter's products.  Everything to me is true to description.  I recieved my Almond Cookie gift set in the mail and I couldnt wait to open it. The smell is to die for, sometimes I open my Shea Souffle' just so I can smell it. I also love her labels and containers.  I will forever be a customer of Carol's Daughter and I look forward to the day where I can walk into one of her stores. Her prices are worth every dime. Remember you get what you pay for

I thank God for Carol's Daughter. I have finally found a quality product that makes me feel like I'm at the spa in my own home for a a resonable price. I rather pay $25.00 any day for spectacular service and a fantastic product any day than $10 so-so product filled with water and vaseline. I am a Carols daughter member so are my kids and most of my family. Kudos to Lisa Price for setting that much needed standard in the beauty industry.God Bless You Al

The mirror was very easy to install.  After using the mirror a couple weeks, the plane and magnifying mirrors are very clear and easy to adjust to the correct distance for great viewing.
The only negative is that the halo light does not provide sufficient brightness, but not an issue if mirror is used in a well lighted area

Gone are the days of overpriced department store products that do absolutly nothing for your skin! Gone are the days of spending too much money for a product that sits in your bathroom and collects dust!

This is stuff is kick ass!
If you are the type to buy a product that is endorced by a celebrity, then you can be satisfied here, and if you go to the Mario Badescu website you can see all the celebrities who have gone to the spa and used the products.

If you are looking for a product that makes your skin feel clean and fresh, without spending your paycheck, then you have found the perfect company!!!

I have been using the products from Mario Badescu for three years now, and I have gotten my Mom, Mother-in-Law, Sister, and other friends and family to become Mario Badescu junkies too.

That all said, if you want something to pamper yourself look no further.

(Try the Seaweed Soap, and the Orange Protective Cream. And if you have a problem with Pimples then look for the drying lotion, but beware its strong stuff.

I love this product.  I use it when my son spits up and it either goes on his face or body.  Sometimes it still stinks from the spit up after wiping with just a wipe so I pump a little of this on a wipe and it does the trick.  I have various Mustela products and they all work great

I got this product as a gift at a baby shower and wasn't sure how I was going to use it--I was a little unclear as to exactly what it was. . .is it soap? (no) is it astringent? (no) what the heck is it?  Answer:  it's a baby Windex! I have used this going on 4 years and 2 babies.  It removes any lingering stink from diaper changes, cleans spit-up off skin and leaves a nice fresh scent, removes macaroni and cheese and chee-tos from hands and faces, not to mention kool-aid, chocolate, spaghetti sauce residue. . .you name it, Physiobebe cleans it up.  Just pump some onto a cotton pad, wipe, or napkin, and clean off your kid.  I highly recommend it

The bottle itself is a real looker, with thick rich smooth glass encasing golden rich amber jewel like liquid on the inside. Fancy shmancy I said as I took it out of the delivery box. 
I opened the bottle to take a whiff and my oh my, it's definitely worth the price tag.
The real test of course came at bath time, and this sure delivered beyond looks alone.

The bath water turned bubbly and luscious with earthy aromas of warm, primrose vanilla and the rich, juicy and creamy finish of the apricot. This should be eaten, not bathed in!
Insanely delicious as it would make a wonderful present for any friend or relative, but better yet for yourself.

 Apparently this can be used as a body wash, and I am really looking forward to using it in the shower, as I'm a shower person in the morning, and this would make a tantalizing shower experience for sure. I have reviewed a few of these bath items today, and now I feel so sweet and sleepy after my bath that I feel extremely happy for getting this bubble bath. It's little delectable products such as this one that bring you calm and pleasantness after a long day, and nothing can replace some nice relaxation alone in the tub. Even my boyfriend loved the scent as he used it the other day, so it can be for both men and women, but I might have to hide it in case he secretly likes it too much!

I purchased this product over the summer 2006 when I became concerned about sun damage.  My only question about this product is whether the vitamin C in it is stable (i.e., should the product be refrigerated to maintain its potency?).  Regardless, it has a sufficient amount of vitamin C for the product to be worthwhile (10% - woo hoo!), and other vitamin C creams are much more expensive.  

The nice thing about this product is that a little really does go a long way.  You squeeze a small amount onto your finger (hygienic packaging!) and spread onto your face.  As the product spreads, it absorbs and has a silky finish.  I'm not sure why, but I have taken to mixing this product with a little bit of Cetaphil moisturizer and I love the result.  It does have an orangey citrus smell, but I am not bothered by it (which is rare).

This is a great finisher - use after you've drenched your hair with leave-in conditioner, and focus on the ends which tend to spread out and fly away and the little wispies at your temple and nape.  Smells great but doesn't compete with the smell of other products.  Only con: a little bit does NOT go a long way.  It's expensive to stock up

For a mirror shine and one that doesn't disappear on the rim of a glass with the first sip my choice is MAC. Lipglass feels good on your lips, as if it contained some emollients. And (this is a big AND) it's not tacky or sticky. 

The colors are a veritable palette of shades to suit every mood, occasion and skin tone. They range from a playfully innocent baby-doll nude to a dramatic dark diva red. 

Another plus (and this is a big PLUS following the big AND) MAC Lipglass is so price accessible that you can easily pick a bouquet of these delicious shades. Try adding a Lipglass over a country cousin lipstick for a wow impact. 

Enjoy!

MAC LipGlass is the absolute best. There are plenty of colors to choose from, SUPER-Shiny, and the gloss is thick, stays on and doesn't run. 
The best colors are....
NICO for a cute lavender pink color with a glittery shine. 
OYSTERGIRL is a shimmery baby pink.
OH BABY is the perfect gloss for any earth toned lipstick.
CHAI looks amazing with black smokey eyes. It's the perfect neutral earthy gloss and has no glitter or shimmer - just pure shine

I'm REALLY anal about scented/flavored lipglosses- especially ones scented or flavored with vanilla, but MAC LipGlass isn't that vanilla-ish at all!  It's got very pigmented color, it stays on a LONG time for a gloss, and each tube lasts a long time...  Don't let what the other reviewer said about the vanilla scent throw you off

I reach for CK One on days that I want a crisp, fresh scent.  Intended to be a unisex fragrance, it is not at all sweet or flowery.  However, it does have a softness to it that I personally believe makes it better suited to a woman than a man; I find it to be slightly musky without being masculine.  Overall, this is a really nice, neutral fragrance for everyday wear

I use both this mascara and Lancome Flextencils  when i'm going out, Flextencils first then coat with Hypnose.  My lashes look HUGE and not too clumpy.  Flextencils add great length, while Hypnose adds volume.  I use Hypnose by itself on just an average day.  Great Product! Makes my Lashes big and not clump

I've always used Lancome mascaras, before Hypnose, I used Denfincils.  Hypnose is a great mascara.  Never clumps, the non-waterproof version is easily removable, and your lashes look amazing.  Definately give this product a try

So far this is the best thickening mascara I have tried that are either sold in drug stores or at department stores. It is not sticky or gloppy and you won't look like Tammy Fay with spider lashes. I do however, have to apply two coats to bring out the more sparse areas of my lashes, but I have finally stopped my search for thickening mascaras. My journey ends here

       Tried and true might well describe the products offered by Caswell-Massey as generations have relied upon them for both quality and efficacy.  Established in 1752, it's America's oldest Chemist and Perfumer.  My grandmother enjoyed their products, and I do, too.

	Their Almond & Aloe Liquid Soap is a boon because it not only cleanses well but moisturizes as it does so.  Far too many soaps leave skin feeling dry and itchy.

	Almond, as we  know, has a lovely distinctive fragrance as well as skin softening properties.  Combine it with aloe which contains healing properties, and you have a uniquely beneficial cleanser.

	Other ingredients include Vitamins A and D for nourishment.  This soap is particularly useful for those who wash their hands frequently during the day and for those with normal to dry or sensitive skin.

	Other items in Caswell-Massey's Almond & Aloe line include Body Balm, Bath Seltzer, Cold Cream Soap, Hand Cream, Hand & Body Emulsion, and Almond Body Splash

This bath melt was nice.  It smelled great but it is pretty sweet.  It didn't do anything spectacular to the water, just kind of made it look soapy.  The melt took it's time melting and the smell lasted throughout the bath.  I took the melt after it sat in the water for a while and rubbed it directly on my skin which made my skin smell nice.  It also moisturizes well and makes the water feel smooth and silky, but the smell didn't linger on my skin once I was out of the water

If you haven't tried Lush or Creamy Candy, do it! Creamy Candy smells delicious and leaves your skin silky soft. For soap to match, try Rock Star. Mmmmm!!! I can't place the fragrance; it's cherry, but not, cotton candy, but not - it's VERY sweet smelling and the scent lasts and lasts.  Enjoy

This is the best micro peel I have ever tried!  The thing I noticed first was that when I applied "when hope is not enough" and "the present"  they went on so smoothly.  They absorbed equally.  In my mid-30's, my young skin is fading, but this really brought it back.  I won't say I am 19 again, but I am sure the difference is obvious.  I am a hairstylist and my customers have been making mention of how great my skin looks since I added this to my bag of tricks.  It is a lot more effective that I would have thought, and I have not had a microdermabrasion since I started using this 2-4 times per month

I love, love this product. I can't believe how much I actually used it; I ran out of my box within two months! All those tops that have a wide open neck needed the bra strap to sit on the edge of my shoulder--this kept my straps in place all day and night! A few of my work tops have buttons that stop short towards the bottom; I use the strips to close the flap in place so it's smooth all the way down. Tip: in some cases I cut the strips in half; even half a strip holds my bra straps in place. This product holds things in place or down, it does not lift and hold--its not ducked tape.

The powder/foundation is excellent for skin which is oily and large-pored.
It is one of the best around for no-caking, no-oil, smooth surface skin.
If you can't stand the feel of cream or lotion foundations, Chanel does it best!!
Also, my seller was terrific

I love this foundation.  It is a easy one step process. I don't like to use liquid.  I need something easy, quick and foolproof. I am always in a hurry with 3 kids I don't have time for multi steps.  I also have acne and red cheeks.  This evens out my skin and covers my acne. My skin looks flawless. I have tried so many products including MAC, Bare Minerals, Lancome, Origins, Shiseido etc..  My only problem with this makeup is...
It is so expensive.  What do you expect, it's Chanel. Pure perfection

I absolutely love this kit. I love that I can use THE GREAT MYSTERY every morning and it isn't harsh on my skin and I love using THE GREATEST LOVE at night and when I wash it off it just melts into my skin I don't even have to put on a moisturizer. For something really nice try using THE GREAT MYSTERY and then put THE GREATEST LOVE on top of that. It's really amazing. The only caution I would have is when using THE GREATEST LOVE don't rub it in you have to massage it very lightly otherwise it will irritate your skin and can cause breakouts or make you feel like you have a sun burn.

I suffered from a severe case of shingles that affected the right side of my face.  The infection left scars on half of my face.  I started using the Exfoliate Kit regularly. After four months, my face now looks normal, and I'm able to go without makeup again.  Thanks Philosophy

Best skin care line I have ever used.  Frequent air travel wrecked havoc on my skin, and the exfoliate kit revealed a complexion I never knew I had.  I'm currently using other Philosophy products, and have recommended them to family and friends.

I absolutely adore this scent!  It certainly is not just for men!  Anyone who loves the smell of limes will love this!  The sea salt is amazing!  I literally haven't been able to use any other soap since discovering it two years ago, and I used to be a body wash person!  Never again!  Give it a try! It'll wake you right up in the morning and keep your energy high

I have been using this product for years.  I have a really oily T-zone, and I find that this product keeps it in control.  It is a very good cleanser that removes the oil without drying your skin.  No matter what color your skin tone may be, I think you will like this product!

This product is absolutely brilliant. In the past I have always had to go to the bathroom and blot with tissues and get my powder and puff out. Taking too long. Plus ending up with a cake face as the day goes on.
 With these powder papers, I can do it anytime discreetly, without having to use a mirror or a puff. Just a fresher face with a slight dusting of powder. Perfect

About 10 years ago, I began getting ingrown whiskers on my neck from shaving.  Not only did they not feel good (they'd itch, and were sensitive) but they looked horrible. The front of my neck was red, and I would have horrible red and white bumps all over the skin where whiskers would curl and grow back down into the skin.  I was totally self concsious, because it looked horrible.  The only thing I could for the longest time was pluck them with tweezers.  That took a lot of time, and digging into my skin to pull the hairs was very uncomfortable, and really didn't work that well.  I tried switching to an electric razor with little success.  I could not have a close shave on my neck without getting the horrible ingrown hairs.

I searched the web for months to try and find something that would work.  I found some advice for a few different things, but none worked.  I finally ran across a website of a distributor that was selling Tend Skin.  By that point I wasn't sure anything would work, but I was desperate for something, so I bought it.  I am SO glad I did.  It really works when you use it as directed, and you see results by the time you have to shave again.

I apply Tend Skin with a cotton ball or pad to my neck after I shave and dry my face.  I will then apply it again in the evening, and repeat each morning and night.  It does not take much at all.  I always buy the largest bottle for fear that one day Tend Skin will disappear!  If you have ingrown facial hair from shaving, you NEED to get this.  It is the only thing that I have found the works, and I am 100% happy with it.  It is rather pricey, but I never hesitate to buy because it is worth every penny to me.

The only small "complaint" I have about it is that it smells just a tad funny to me.  My wife says it smells fine to her, so I don't worry about it.  I wonder if they could make it with a slightly nicer smell - or none at all.  It really doesn't matter, though, because Tend Skin is AWESOME and I don't know what I'd do without it.

I can't speak to how effective it is for ingrown leg hair, etc. but I would imagine it would work the same

I have used Tend Skin for around three years now for razor bumps on the bikini line. Before I started using it, I had tried everything else and resigned to the fact that I'd always be stuck with bumps along the bikini line. A friend of mine told me about Tend Skin and swore by it, so I bought a small bottle. It seemed like it was expensive, but that first bottle lasted well over 6 months. It does smell like alcohol at first but the smell goes away when it dries. As far as the other reviews on here, I've only had stinging when I used it IMMEDIATELY after shaving...I think b/c the pores were still open from the shower. For me, it's been a skin saver when I'd already given up the search. I hope that the negative reviews on here don't discourage people from trying it. Everyone's skin reacts somewhat differently. Of the millions of bottles of Tend Skin sold every year, I think the half dozen people on here who didn't like it are the few unhappy rarities, not the average who, like me, thank goodness it's around.

This cream cleanser is wonderful! I have used the Clinique 3 step program since I was a teenager until I went to an at home Body Shop party and tried this cleanser. I have been using it ever since. It is so soft and creamy, feels great going on my skin, and leaves it feeling clean, smooth and moisturized. Its great at gently removing make-up in the evenings and is a nice pick me up first thing in the mornings

This fun fragrance comes across to me as soft and slightly sweet, with a feel that's both young and a bit sexy.  The scent is quite pretty, with a bit of floral, and the lightness of it makes it a perfect everyday scent (although it works well for romance, too!).  As mentioned above, the scent does have a youthful, fresh feel to it, and although I've heard some say that the fragrance is best for teens, I'm almost 40, and I enjoy it on days that I'm looking for something lighthearted and fun (granted, I probably wouldn't wear it everyday).  Lucky You comes in a cute pink bottle with a unique rubber stopper, and it has good staying power, although the scent grows more subtle over time.  Recommended for women of all ages who are young at heart

This is a very suttle fragrance, that lasts for hours. Slightly floral,however is a very intimate scent, most people need to get very close to notice, which can be good, but also a sign that you need to spray yourself all over. I would recommend picking this up if you want something to carry around in your purse to spray here and there. It last for hours but is not an "all day" perfume

I bought this perfume about one year ago with a gift certificate.
I was skeptical about purchasing perfume online but I was not dissapointed. This perfume is absolutely fabulous! When you first put it on the floral freshness and ruby grapefruit awakens your senses as the top notes. The middle notes included a powdery musk that is sensual yet not to woodsy. And the bottom notes of jasmine are so graceful yet grasping.
Buy this perfume. You will fall in love with it

Of all the higher end mascaras I've tried, this one is by far the best.  Your lashes look longer and thicker with just ONE coat and looks like natural great lashes, not made up.  The creamy gel formula goes on smooth, never clumps or feels sticky-and true to form, your lashes will curl up nicely.  Although not a water proof mascara, it has incredible staying power, cleans off easily.  I LOVE this mascara, won't look elsewhere

I have this product working in my hair right now. It is simply wonderful! 

First off, it smells like lovely Victorian rosebud-almond pudding. It has a similar consistency. I can get about three to four uses from each container and I have very thick hair. 

My hair was preciously quite dry and abused. I had dyed it twice in the last six months. After ONE use of this product my hair felt better than it had in YEARS. Silky, strong and shiny. I love this product! I highly recommend it.

I've been a fan of this product for a couple of years, since I have very long, wavy hair. It moisturizes really well and I use it every ten days or so. It smells like a weird salad dressing when you put it on, kind of vinegary and spicy, but when you wash it out the scent is toned down a bit. It still smells unusual (spicy and vaguely nutty), but not unpleasant.

I warm a good handful of this in the microwave, put it on my dry hair and tie it in a bun, wait 20 minutes, then shampoo it out using a liquid shampoo and condition with a light conditioner, like Coolaulin or a small amount of American Cream. If you have short hair you probably won't need this deep of a treatment, but for those of us with a lot of hair, or who have damaged or very thick hair, it is great. It makes my hair shiny and tangle-free again.

It doesn't have any of the silicones that commercial conditioners have, so if you are looking for that slick feeling you get from Pantene you won't find it here. But the ingredients in this don't build up in your hair the way silicones do, so for those of us who are making a conscious choice to avoid silicone buildup in our hair, this is a great deep conditioner

HI

<review_text>
HSuan Wen Hua Hair Treatment is one of the best hair treatments I've come across... and I'm a huge hair junkie and have tried MANY things.  Ever since finding LUSH several months ago, I have not even touched another brand of hair care.

HSuan Wen Hua Hair Treatment is made with fresh ingredients like bananas, avocadoes and fresh olive oil.  

You use this BEFORE you wash your hair, so apply it to DRY hair.  I usually put my hair up in a pony tail and only do the ends because that's where the damage is.  Then I twist my hair up in a bun and rubberband a plastic bag over it.  I try to leave it on as long as I can (overnight if I'm lucky), shampoo my hair and condition like regular after.  Because this is a treatment and not so much a hair conditioner, you still need to use a seperate conditioner.

The results are amazing and my hair is so much softer and in such better condition after use.  Since I only do the ends, it's easy to feel the difference between the ends of my hair that was treated and the rest of my hair that was not.

HSuan Wen Hua Hair Treatment is a M-U-S-T for my hair regime.  Definately recommended

 This treatment works extremely well!  I looked on here and saw that there were no extrememly helpful reviews, so I decided to write one. I have long, golden, untreated hair. However it was as dry as straw so I decided to try this. Here how it is: the smell is amazing (it smells like pumpkin pie or gingerbread cookies) after use the hair looks soft and shiny, however it makes hair flat. This product is a deep moisturizer therefore the hair does not have any "pouf" to it. It is still worth the money though! Rehydration of the hair is supremely important and this rehydrates well. Just after shampooing do not use a conditioner (unless that just doesn't work well for you), which helps the flatness. 

A few helpful tips:
1. This goes on DRY hair
2. After putting lots of this treatment on, try putting a bag over your hair and keeping it shut with a clip. The heat that your head produces allows the hair cuticles to open and fully absorb the treatment. This works 2Xs better than Lush's intstructions (my mother is a hairstylist).
3. Leave the bag tight around your head for 20 to 40 minutes
4. Afterwards shampoo like normal, but I still recommend not using a conditioner for that day.

Hopefully this helps anyone with questions. This really is an amazing product and should be used about twice a month (more if you'd like but that's probably not necessary). Enjoy your beatiful shiny hair!

I love this product.  My eye brows are growing, but not all over in the areas where I'm putting the product.  The hair has become darker, but nothing extreme, just in a way where I'm able to see it now (I'm naturally a toehead).  I would recommend this to others, but I'm saddened that it's so hard to find, and I was unable to do so in a store

I am a fan of Ralph Lauren and check new products from this brand. I liked this scent, although I am probably more used to Polo Blue, which is also great. It is better to get an idea in a store because it is not quite possible to decide from reviews. Anyway, it is worth checking especially if you are looking for a new cologne for St. Valentine's day

At first spray, this can be a pretty potent cologne, but after 1-2 minutes this fades into a nice rosey spice scent that is much lighter than it's green original polo brother. lasts all day long and into the night. Worth checking out if you are a fan of cool water and lotto, or lighter scented cologne.

If you like the citrusy scent of other Fresh products (as I do) then you will probably really like this lip balm. It has a lovely lemony taste, and a soft, smooth texture. It's not waxy or greasy, and my husband likes to kiss me when I have it on! The only reason that I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because it doesn't last as long as I'd like. My lips tend to get pretty chapped in the winter, and I put balm on at night to condition my lips. This one is gone after about 30 minutes to an hour, so I need a much more concentrated lip balm (like Bliss balm) for night use. But if you're looking for a light, yummy balm, this might be it

This has to be by far one of the best lip treatments on the market.  Pricy...yes.  But well worth every cent.  In as few as two uses my lips have gone from cracked to whole.  Tastes as good as it smells.  Lemon...brownsugar..like the body scrub of the same name.  
My only complaint: it doesn't have the longevity of say Prada's lip balm (which I use when running)

I love these inserts!  I had trouble finding ones this size.  Not too big, not too small.  They definitely help me to fill out my bras!  I would suggest putting them in bras with pockets for inserts.  I tried just setting these in my bra, but if I moved my arms up and my bra moved around, I was afraid that the cupcakes would fall out.  These are a great product though

lipstick going. This review is for the Guava Stain shade. I first bought this lipstick, I believe in the mid to late eighties. I was delighted with it then and am now. It is sheer, light, non greasy and the color never changes. The color is NOT neutral, but I find that I can wear it with almost any color of clothing except primarily pink or red outfits. Over the years it has become just about the only lipstick shade I wear. I would buy different brands,different shades and wear them maybe once then back to Guava Stain. It along with Clinque's soft pressed blush in New Clover, orginally bought about the same time as the lipstick have become my favorites, and the one's I reach for time and again. They are my dependables. Daytime wear for sure, not night, this is a subtle sheer color

This is a great item from LUSH.  It works so well, lasts a very long time and is worth every penny.  First off the scent.  It is dead-on fresh coconut.  Not the fake sun tan oil/beach smell you'd expect.  It makes a TON of creamy, thick lather with only a few swipes through (soaking) wet hair.  It cleasnes really well and rinses clean.  For me, there was no residue left behind, only softness.  As I said, it does last for ages BUT you have to make sure you leave it in a well ventilated soap dish with a drain.  If it's left in water, say goodbye to it in a couple of days, as you will be left with a mushy mess half the size of when you left it.

Try it at least once, if it doesn't work for your hair... it's also great to shave with

but it definitally did not work as it was intended. It is intended to moisturize hair. I have long, fine, oily hair, and I received Trichomania as a gift. I love the smell, but when I first used it, it left my hair very dry which I consider a good thing considering the state of my hair. It just didnt do what it was supposed to. However, if you have really oily hair, this is the thing for you. No problems with lathering either, especally if you rub the bar in your hair, not in your hands. Doesnt leave white flakes either

If you have dry hair, Trichomania is for you. 

It smells like real coconuts, not that synthetic crap in suntan lotions, and works wonders on my dry, colored, and generally abused hair. Plus, it lasts forever. All of Lush's solid haircare lasts much longer than bottled stuff and contains no silicones. They do take some getting used to but once you adjust, everything else will smell so chemical and you'll wonder why you ever used them.

I first smelled this perfume on a colleague of mine, about a year ago. Every time she walked by me I got a whiff of this heavenly scent that she wore nearly every day. So, I finally stopped her and asked what she was wearing. I'd never heard of it, so I jumped online and looked it up, found a bottle and bought it. I couldn't wait to try it out, so when the perfume finally arrived I put it right on. Imagine my disappointment when I smelled a scent totally unlike the one I'd experienced. On me it was overpoweringly musky, nothing like the seductive fragrance I'd smelled on my colleague. But, an odd thing happened. I didn't wash it right off, and when I smelled it again about 30 minutes later it had become the alluringly sensual perfume I'd fallen in love with. In fact, the longer I wore it the better it smelled. Obviously it depends on your body chemistry to achieve it's bloom. Now, I wear it when I go out in the evenings, and people comment on how wonderfully sexy it smells. If you buy this perfume don't judge it too quickly, as I did....give it a little time and you're sure to love it. You only need to use a little, and it lasts for HOURS.

Works exceptionally well.  Clears pimple faster than other types of treatments I have used and reduces the redness very quickly.  My 2 teenage daughters love the product as well.  Because such a small amount is needed a tube will last a long time.  Will definitely buy it again!

Murad Acne Spot Treatment really works to drive away those unsightly blemishes!  It heals even the big nasty pimples in a few days, with the smaller ones healing in hours.  It really does help to minimize the appearance of most acne after I apply it, too.  Overall I would say it is a great produce for anyone who, like me, considers even minor acne to be a major annoyance

I have this lip gloss in Sweetie and will be trying other shades.  I am very pleased with it!  I wear it over stay-on type lip colors in other brands, and it keeps my color on all day (even after eating)!  It doesn't really feel too sticky if you blot after application.  I only wish it tasted as good as it smells (not that it tastes bad, it's just blah)!

I love this lip gloss, the cake batter taste/smell is totally addictive.  The colors are lacking though, all of the colors are light, very sheer shades. I bought the color Babydoll which is a light pink.  It goes on sheer and I love the smooth texture too. This product is supposed to have glitter in it but I didnt' notice any, and/or its not too glaring, which makes it fine for me to wear it at work.

These bristles have just the right combination of softness and strength.  However, since I only use this as a back scrub brush, the detachable design is not optimal for me.  After a few months, the brush-handle attachment point became compromised (probably from all the exposure to water), and I found that the brush would often detach from the handle as I scrubbed my back.  At this point, many more months down the road, the brush no longer stays mounted to the handle at all, so I am looking for a (non-detachable) replacement.  Even so, I recommend this product because of it's great bristles, and also because the handle was great while it lasted.

The tounge-and grove way the handle detached make it easy to use in the shower (dont have my glasses on).  The detachable brush has medium soft bristles and will be easy on the skin.  The strap on the brush is cotton, so this probably isn't a once-in-a lifetime purchase, but very good for the price.  Everybody needs one

L'Occitane's Lavender Harvest Matte Face Lotion *really works* to mattify oil and makes a nice makeup primer. 

I don't have oily skin, but tried some samples over a night serum I was using with avocado oil to mattify it, so my face wouldn't be greasy on my pillow.  It left my skin feeling satiny and smooth.  Avocado is one of the heavier, thicker oils and did wonders for my dry skin, but I hated the feel of it, so finding this was a real bonus to fix that problem.  

Lavender oil also has relaxing aromatherapeutic properties, is a natural antiseptic which helps prevent blemishes, and mosquitoes don't like it, so if you have oily skin and live in a humid climate in the summer, you should try this! 

Note: I have had good luck shopping with L'Occitane through Amazon, but called first to make sure what I was ordering was in stock on their website.

This is the only fragrance I have found that truly smells "tropical".  This is my boyfriends favorite scent, and he thinks all perfumes "stink".  The four stars is because it takes this spray awhile to go from greasy and oily to dry.  You have to wait awhile before you get dressed.  But it smells great

Mistral, as many know, is a powerful, gusty wind that blows across the south of France. Mistral, as I was happy to discover, is also the name of a line of bath and body products, all French inspired, all lusciously lovely from scented soaps to soothing lotions to rejuvenating body butters. 

Matthew Tilker, founder and president of Mistral, utilizes Shea butter, which is an efficacious natural healer, in a myriad of must-have forms. Derived from the nuts of the African Shea Tree (according to sacred custom the nuts are harvested primarily by women), this butter is highly emollient, a boon for those with dry skin, chapped lips, any number of skin irritations. 

The pure Shea Butter soap comes in a plethora of inviting fragrances, all milled six times (while others boast being triple milled). South Seas is a particular favorite - it's as fresh as an ocean breeze and as calming, soothing as a tropical island. The marine scent is accented with a touch of grapefruit, white flowers and soft woods. An irresistible combination. 

South Seas is a fragrance with which you wish to surround yourself - made possible by the shower gel, body lotion, massage bath and body oil, bath salts and candle all available at very accessible prices.

This is very good soap, however it's too expensive to buy on a regular basis unless you are rich.  Very good quality though and I would buy it again if I had some money

I have searched far & wide for a product that aids in the treatment/management of keratosis pilaris (little red bumps on the backs of my arms).  It is estimated that 40-50% of the population has a form of keratosis pilaris and there is no cure for the skin condition.

However, this Neostrata AHA 8 significantly reduced bumps and redness after only 2 weeks.  After 4 weeks, it had almost vanished.  The only drawback is that after 2-3 weeks of non-use the bumps tend to resurface.  But, if you keep the application up, the bumps stay away!  I use it religiously over the summer or if i have any upcoming special occasions where I want to look my best.

I found the product in SELF magazine, suggesting its use for keratosis pilaris management and have nothing but rave reviews!!  Finally, something that works

Although this is supposed to be used as a deep conditioning treatment I used it several times a week and loved the way it made my hair look and feel.  Only drawback is the price, and the container, which you have to be very careful with in the shower!  But all in all, it's a wonderful product for fine hair and I've come back to it again and again!

I've been using this kit for several weeks now, and I am absolutely amazed at the results!  I've had severe acne scarring due to a birth control pill I was taking.  They were bright red, and no concealer on the market would cover them.  After one week of using Murad, I've noticed the scars fading!  I thought nothing on this planet would fade them, but Murad is!  I've also been blessed with good genes in having oily skin.  Murad drastically reduces the amount of shine I have.  I highly recommend this product to everyone

This product made my skin look absolutely great! I use it twice a day and within one week I saw a huge difference. I've been now using Murad for a month and the improvement is astonishing. I get compliments on my skin every day. I highly recommend it

I've been using Murad for about 3 weeks now, and it has made a huge difference! I am in my early 20's and have had problems with mild breakouts since my teens. I've tried drugstore products, wich never seemed to make any difference, and Proactive which was so harsh it actually burned and made my skin much worse. Murad is gentle enough for me to use twice a day, and has left my skin breakout free! It has also improved the texture and feel of my skin, and makes my pores nearly invisible. I recomend Murad to anyone whose skin is breakout prone but too sensitive for the benzoyle peroxide formulas in other acne products. The only complaint I have about Murad is the price - it can be a little much for a poor college student - but the results are worth it if you can afford it!

yes, i've had murad for about 2 weeks now and i've seen huge improvement! murad is a godsend! anyways... i was just wondering if the kit is really supposed to last me 2 months? i use it every morning and night. thats 120 times! umm... dont know if im gonna have any left... i know for sure the cleanser i will. (step 1) but steps 2 and 3 are very small quantity... and hopefully i wont need a lot of acne spot treatment usage cause they'll be all gone :) i definately recommend murad to everyone. like others, i've tried proactiv, but murad seems to work better with my skin. just try the one month starter kit first

I discovered the Murad Acne Complex Kit about six years ago and have been using it since... It cleared my acne up within weeks and has kept the acne away. Some products I tried dried my skin out but Murad Acne Complex leaves it feeling clean and hydrated without all the chemical smells. I recommend anyone with acne try Murad Acne Complex to see if it will work as well for you.

I love this product. It takes only a few drops to make my hair shine. It is light, smells quite nice and is not at all overpowering or strong smelling. I don't buy cheap fragrances, so I don't know what "bad perfumes" reviewer NycoleB is comparing this with. I suppose everyone's body chemistry is different. I haven't found any other product that does what this does so I'll be buying another bottle when this one is done

I was amazed by the quality of this product when I first purchased it in the summer of 2006.  It gives my hair a perfect sheen and softness that I have never achieved with such lightweight hair oil before and my hair has acheive lengths that I have not seen in years!  Tui Hair Oil has a beautiful scent which does not change over the course of wearing it in your hair for a day or two, or even longer if you wish.
